'''Guava''' is one of the many genera of [[tree]]s found above ground. Like the vast majority of above ground trees, guava [[wood]] is brown and produces brown products. Logs and leaves can be processed in a [[dyer's shop]] into yellow [[dye]].

Guava trees bear '''guavas''' that can be harvested by setting up a gathering [[zone]]. They can be eaten raw, cooked, or brewed into [[alcohol|guava wine]].

Some [[Dwarf|dwarves]] [[Preferences|like]] guava trees for their ''fruit''.
