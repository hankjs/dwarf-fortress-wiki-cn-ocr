An '''Open space''' is a [[map tile]] state that indicates there is nothing there - no [[floor]], [[wall]]s, or [[tree]]s; just air, [[water]], or [[magma]] (and maybe [[creature]]s).

In both [[Dwarf fortress mode]] and [[Adventure mode]] you can look at the world around you with the [[Mouse control|mouse]]; in adventure you can also {{k|l}}ook with the keyboard. A description of the tile will be displayed below the right hand end of the [[status]] bar (same place in adventure mode even though there is no status bar), including if it is open space.
