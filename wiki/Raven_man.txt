'''Raven men''' are [[animal people]] variants of the common [[raven]], who inhabit most [[savage]] [[biome]]s. They spawn in groups of anywhere between 5-10 individuals and are generally content to keep to themselves. In terms of size, they are a little over half the weight of the average [[dwarf]]. All raven men are born with Legendary [[skill]] in [[Climber|climbing]].

Like other savage animal people, raven men can join [[civilization]]s, become [[historical figure]]s, appear as [[visitor]]s and be playable in [[adventurer mode]].

Some dwarves [[Preferences|like]] raven men for their ''intelligence''.

Ancient scripts tell of a Raven Woman whose father was a great demon, capable of shadow magic. Text from an unknown language roughly translating to 'Azarath Mentrion Zinthos' accompanies a few recountings, as well as mentions of a robin man, a shapeshifting beast man, an extraterrestrial elf, and a mechanically enhanced human, but as none of these exist, they are discounted as fanciful tales.
