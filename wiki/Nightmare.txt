[[File:nightmare_sprite_preview.png|right]]'''Nightmares''' {{Tile|Ñ|0:1}} are procedurally-generated, [[fanciful]] [[night creature]]s summoned by [[necromancer]]s and [[demon]]s{{Verify}} to fight in battle, larger than [[dwarf|your]] [[human|standard]] [[elf|humanoids]], but smaller than [[titan]]s and [[forgotten beast]]s. They are short-lived, and neutral to creatures with {{token|NOFEAR|c}}. Nightmares summoned in fortress mode will be friendly. When summoned, nightmares will possess Talented [[skill]] in [[Observer|observing]], [[Fighter|fighting]], [[wrestling]], [[Biter|biting]], [[Striker|striking]], [[Kicker|kicking]] and [[dodging]].   They do not need to [[sleep]], [[eat]] or drink, feel no [[pain]] (though still have nerves that can be [[Wound|damaged]], therefore affecting motor function), cannot be stunned, feel no fear, completely avoid [[traps]], don't need to breathe, or feel dizziness, nausea, have [[Creature_token#EXTRAVISION|extravision]], and never get tired from over-exertion.

Graphically, the sprites that nightmares use will be of black (or sometimes grey), mysterious-looking creatures that resemble the generated appearance they've been given. This same setup is used for other procedurally-generated creatures, such as [[bogeyman|bogeymen]] and [[experiment]]s.

Since they are procedurally-generated, their in-game appearance (which can be seen by spawning them in the [[object testing arena]]) will vary by world, but will always end with: "Now you will know why you fear the night." This same quote is associated with [[bogeymen]]. By default, there are multiple nightmare types per world, and the number can be set in [[Advanced_world_generation#Number_of_Nightmare_Types|advanced world generation]]. Like many procedurally-generated creatures in the game, not only can their appearance be randomized, but the color of their blood.

As with all procedurally generated creatures how much of a threat they are varies greatly, however their large size and innate combat skills along with the possibilities of procedural generation means an adventurer can end up fighting something above a [[semi-megabeast]] in threat. A [[necromancer]]'s ability to summon them is arguably their currently most dangerous ability, though the nightmare may also end up fighting their summoner's undead minions.

All nightmares are linked with the [[sphere]]s of misery, night, and - unsurprisingly - nightmares.

Some dwarves [[preferences|like]] nightmares for their ''unfathomably horrifying nature.''
