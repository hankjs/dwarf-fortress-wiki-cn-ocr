'''Saguaros''' are a type of [[above ground]] [[tree]]. They are a cactus, and grow in [[desert]]s. Like the overwhelming majority of overland trees, saguaro rib [[carpenter|wood]] logs are brown and produce brown products.

Saguaros are one of the least productive trees for wood. Cutting a saguaro generally does not give much wood, 2-3 logs on average.

Saguaros bear fruit for a relatively long period of time. This can be very useful in [[adventurer mode]], as the saguaro fruit can still be plucked and eaten long after other shrubs and trees have lost their fruits. In [[fortress mode]], the fruit can be [[cooking|cooked]], but not brewed.

Some [[Dwarf|dwarves]] [[Preferences|like]] saguaros for their ''amazing arms''.

== Trivia ==
*Its solid density was determined empirically by DF players, as evidenced in the raws. There was no other public, online source of that information prior to ''Dwarf Fortress''. Toady One received a "Birthday Artifact" in 2012 made out of Saguaro rib wood.
