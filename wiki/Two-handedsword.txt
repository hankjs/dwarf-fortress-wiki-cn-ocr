A '''two-handed sword''' is an [[attack types|edged]] [[weapon]] that is 3× the size of a [[short sword]], with 5× the contact area. Two-handed swords have the same basic attacks as other swords, but benefit from increased damage potential, at a cost of reduced usability. Two-handed swords can span up to 6 ft. in length, and, as the name implies, were intended for use with a two-hand grip. The enormous contact area of two-handed swords allows massive wounds to be inflicted on nearly any target, no matter their size, if body parts are not simply cloven apart or removed altogether.

Two-handed swords use and train the [[swordsdwarf]] skill. As foreign weapons, dwarves cannot [[forge]] two-handed swords, limiting supply to whatever low-[[quality]] specimens can be traded from human [[caravan]]s or scavenged from invaders. 

[[Weapon#Size|Due to the size of two-handed swords]], most dwarves are unable to equip them. With height and broadness modifiers, some dwarves ''should'' be able to use a two-handed sword, and a select few might manage to do so one-handed. Unfortunately, due to a [[#Bugs|bug]], two-handed swords cannot currently be equipped by any dwarves.

==Bugs==
In fortress mode, one-handed vs. two-handed checks are performed correctly, but can wield vs. can't wield ignores height and broadness modifiers, so dwarves cannot equip two-handed swords.{{Bug|0005812}} See [http://www.bay12forums.com/smf/index.php?topic=119068.msg3790913#msg3790913 this forum post] for details.
