'''Crab men''' are [[animal people]] variants of the common [[crab]], who can be found in [[savage]] [[ocean]]s. They spawn in groups of 1-5 individuals and are generally content to keep to themselves. In terms of size, they are a little over half the weight of the average [[dwarf]].

Like other savage animal people, they can join [[civilization]]s, become [[historical figure]]s, appear as [[visitor]]s and be playable in [[adventurer mode]].

Some dwarves [[Preferences|like]] crab men for their ''pincers'' and their ''sideways walk''.

Due to extensive research by ocean-based fortresses, we can conclude that crab men are, in fact, '''not''' related to the infamous cavern-dwelling Crab People - that is to say, the ones that taste like crabs, yet talk like [[humans|people]]. They are also known to occasionally throw an extreme sleepover [[party]]. Crab men are generally unwilling to give up any [[currency|coins]] they have obtained, and often enlist the work of [[sponge_man|sponge men]] and [[squid_man|squid men]] to prepare [[food]].

Crab men [[Agent|spies]] are seemingly their own subspecies, and are considered to be very rare.
