'''Sedimentary''' [[stone layers]] are one of the four possible stone layers that make up any layer below the soil on your map. Sedimentary layers are, on average, the most economically valuable of these four possible layers, both by themselves (if a [[flux]] stone) and for the ores and other stones they tend to contain.

Sedimentary layers are...

Sedimentary layers can be tricky to locate - if you are starting off, and you want access to an embark area with sedimentary layers, use the "Find Desirable Location" function before embark and set your parameters to include sites with [[flux]] stone. Since most flux stones are found in sedimentary layers, this will increase your chances that a suitable site will have sedimentary rock near the surface. Be careful when using the "Find Desirable Location" function, as it will sometimes list green sites that have flux stone but not indicate that it does, actually, have flux stone. To find iron ores, search for a location that has flux stone, medium elevation, and either high or low drainage. On large maps, the ore is sometimes located near mountains and major rivers in large (min ~10x10) chunks.

Alternatively, a [[mountain]] biome that has an [[aquifer]] is guaranteed to be sedimentary as well, due to mountains lacking soil, which means the aquifer must be in sedimentary layers.

(In real-world geology, sedimentary [[stone]] is formed by sediment, which gets carried away by rivers and deposited in constantly-growing heaps, where the pressure at the bottom eventually forms the sediment into stone.)

==Stone found in sedimentary layers==
Sedimentary layers are your only source of [[bituminous coal]] and [[lignite]], vital for fueling non-[[magma]] forges and for the [[coke]] that [[steel]]-making requires (especially if you lack [[tree]]s).  They are much richer in [[iron]] [[ore]]s than other rock formations.  Several sedimentary rocks - [[dolomite]], [[chalk]], and [[limestone]] - are [[flux]]es, required for [[steel]]-making and also being twice as valuable as normal stone, making them useful for [[crafts|trade goods]] or [[furniture]].
