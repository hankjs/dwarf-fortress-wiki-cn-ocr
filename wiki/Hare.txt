:''Not to be confused with [[rabbit]]s.''

{{creaturedesc}}

'''Hares''' are [[Creature|animal]]s that can also be found roaming some [[temperate]] plains individually. Quite small in size, they are benign and harmless to [[Dwarf|dwarves]], making them an easy target for [[hunter]]s. Male hares are referred to as ''buck hares'', while females are called ''doe hares'' and babies are called ''leverets''.

Hares can be captured in [[cage]] [[trap]]s and [[Animal trainer|trained]] into [[pet]]s. Compared to [[rabbit]]s, hares are seven times larger and are worth three times more, though they aren't domesticated and die of old age slightly faster. Hares are large enough to provide [[meat]] and [[bone]]s when [[butcher]]ed, giving as many returns as a [[chicken]].

Some dwarves [[Preferences|like]] hares for their ''long ears'' and their ''fluffy tails''.
