'''Puddingstone''' is a sedimentary stone which occurs as large clusters within [[conglomerate]]. Unlike other mineral inclusions, puddingstone ''will'' support an [[aquifer]] if one is present within its surrounding layer.

==In Real Life==
Puddingstone is a type of poorly sorted conglomerate; that is, it is a stone composed of stone grains that are of various sizes rather than of mostly the same size and is usually cemented together with quartz [[sandstone]].

{{D for Dwarf}}
Contrary to popular opinion, this stone is not made of pudding, although dwarves will often injure their teeth while attempting to verify if Puddingstone lives up to its name.
