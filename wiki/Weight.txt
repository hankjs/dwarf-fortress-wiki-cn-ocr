[[File:weight_burden_preview.png|right]]'''Weight''', or sometimes more correctly termed '''mass''', is an item property, and is measured in the unit ''Γ'', also sometimes known as ''urists'', or more commonly as the ''kilogram'', its equivalent real-life unit.

Weight is largely used by the game to determine how fast someone or something should move, due to encumbrance effects and carry weight restrictions; to calculate damage, since object mass factors into impact momentum; and to some extent to make temperature calculations, as mass factors into heat capacity. Note that, for DF, weight and mass are currently indistinguishable because, as it stands, DF gravity is [http://www.bay12games.com/media/df_talk_8_transcript.html uniform both across the whole universe and from world to world] and buoyancy isn't implemented.

Weight is displayed as a quantity associated with an item. Weight calculation is not entirely straightforward, since each item category &mdash; or sometimes even individual items &mdash; have their own formula for determining weight.

In [[adventure mode]] (where weight is referred to as "burden"), carrying too much weight in a character's inventory will cause them to move more slowly, the more they carry beyond their limits. When this happens, an icon appears above the inventory icon. Movement speed is reduced based on how much you exceed your carrying capacity, it will never reach zero, however, even if you are carrying hundreds of units above your carrying capacity. Characters can carry more the higher their strength attribute is - naturally, stronger, larger characters (such as an [[elephant man]]) are able to carry more.

==Weight Calculation==
The general form for calculating weight in DF is to take the material [[density]] (as found in the raws) multiplied by the item's [[size|volume]].

:Weight (in Γ) = Density (in kg/m<sup>3</sup>) * Volume (in cm<sup>3</sup>) / 1,000,000 (cm<sup>3</sup>/m<sup>3</sup>)

Internally, all custom volume/capacity numbers are rounded ''down'' to the nearest multiple of 10 - thus, if you define a tool with [SIZE:15], it will actually behave as if you had specified [SIZE:10].[http://www.bay12forums.com/smf/index.php?topic=169696.msg8300987#msg8300987]

An item's volume is also used to determine workshop [[clutter]] as well as how many items can fit into a container.
