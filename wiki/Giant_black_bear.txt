'''Giant black bears''' are the [[giant animal]] variant of the common [[black bear]], found in [[savage]] [[taiga]]s and [[temperate]] [[forest]]s. They are solitary creatures, and only three may spawn on a given map. With a {{token|LARGE_PREDATOR|c}} token and a willingness to [[steals food|steal food]] and [[steals drink|booze]] from your [[stockpile]]s, these creatures can pose a threat even to well-prepared fortresses, as they are 18 times the size of the average [[dwarf]] (roughly the size of a [[water buffalo]]).

The best way to prevent them from stealing your food and drink is to use [[cage]] [[trap]]s. Once trapped, these animals can be [[Animal trainer|trained]] into exotic [[pet]]s, possessing the default giant animal value. While they can't be trained for war or hunting, they can still make powerful defense animals, especially if they're [[pasture]]d in the correct area. Like other giant animals, they are considered exotic [[mount]]s.

Some dwarves [[Preferences|like]] giant black bears for their ''strength''.
