A '''Cook''' is a dwarf whose highest skill is in cooking. Cooks will prepare meals at the [[kitchen]] workshop using ingredients available in your fortress, and will also render [[fat]] into [[tallow]] at the kitchen, both of which fall under the Cooking labor.

Although some kinds of [[food]] can be eaten raw, other food resources are ingredients; which are only edible when cooked into a meal. Cooking thus increases the number of food sources available to your fortress. Conversely, cooking plants does not yield plant [[seed]]s, so cooking edible plants decreases your potential [[crop]]s. Eating high-[[item quality|quality]] prepared food gives your dwarves happy [[thought]]s if the meal contains one of their [[preference|favorite]] foods {{Bug|4661}}. It is not precisely known how a cook's skill and the quality of ingredients affect the happiness generated by a meal, but as a general rule there's no such thing as "too good".

== Prepared Meal ==
There are three kinds of prepared meals: easy, fine, and lavish. All three of these give the same [[experience]] gain to the Cooking skill, so making easy meals maximizes experience gain; if you don't care about experience gain, preparing lavish meals saves much more stockpile space. The number of servings produced has no effect on experience gain. Prepared meals can [[wear|rot]], but will do so much more slowly than raw food, especially [[meat]].

Prepared meals come in three varieties:
* '''Easy meals''' require two ingredients and are named "{last ingredient} '''biscuit''' ([[File:biscuit_sprite.png]]).
* '''Fine meals''' require three ingredients and are named "{last ingredient} '''stew''' ([[File:stew_sprite.png]]).
* '''Lavish meals''' require four ingredients and are named "{last ingredient} '''roast''' ([[File:roast_sprite.png]]).

As you can see, the last ingredient added to the meal will determine its name, which in turn is determined more or less randomly by the order in which the cook grabs them. To successfully create a prepared meal, a cook must have access to the proper number of ''distinct stacks'' of ingredients when the job starts, otherwise the job will be cancelled. The same ingredient may be used for a meal multiple times, provided that ingredient is in multiple discrete stacks. The stack size of the finished prepared meal is the sum of the stack sizes of its ingredients, so a cook grabbing "turkey hen egg [14]", "plump helmets [5]" and "plump helmets [5]" would result in a stack of "plump helmet stew [24]". Prepared meals cannot be used as ingredients in other prepared meals.

Cooks may occasionally create a meal that has more than the required number of ingredients; roasts, for instance, may have 5, or, occasionally, 6 ingredients, or even rarely as many as 12. This behavior is presumably a bug, and may be related to the [[Main:Planepacked|Planepacked]] glitch and other similar bugs.  It seems to occur when many stacks of the same food are available (for example, many, many quarry bush leaves) and the cook grabs multiple stacks of the same food.  

Despite their large stack sizes, stacks of prepared meals can usually (though not always) fit into regular [[barrel]]s or [[pot]]s on a food stockpile.

Prepared meals get a quality modifier on their base value and each individual ingredient also gets a quality modifier as well, but more ingredients reduces the value of each. See [[Item_value#Prepared_meal|Item value]] for more information.

== Variety==
Cooks are notorious for choosing ingredients poorly. To maximize variety in your prepared meals (and improve the chance of including a preferred ingredient) you can link several small stockpiles to the kitchen. Avoid using barrels for solid ingredients, or else your cook will likely continue his string of quarry bush leaves x4 roasts.

== Boozecooking==
Booze (and other liquid ingredients) can be used as an ingredient in prepared meals, but the first ingredient stack of any prepared meal must be a solid. Due to a [[#Bugs|bug]], dwarves prefer to cook solid ingredients. Linking stockpiles to the kitchen can force them to include liquids as well.

== Training ==

When rendering large units of fat (for example from elephants or forgotten beasts) a dwarf gains cooking skill extremely quickly due to the dozens or hundreds of units of tallow created per task - even to the point of going from dabbling to skilled in a single task.{{verify|No longer true as of 47.05?}} Thus, rendering fat can be used to rapidly train cooking to high levels.

== Bugs ==
* Cooks will only use liquid ingredients (like [[dwarven syrup]] and [[booze]]) as a last resort, instead preferring to cook only solid foods. {{Bug|2393}} A workaround for this is to set up multiple stockpiles around the kitchen, with ''only'' the liquids stockpile set to allow barrels, exploiting their preference for ingredients in barrels. When the other cooking materials around the kitchen are '''not''' in barrels, the cooks will use liquids along with the other foodstuffs to cook their meals.
* Cooks prefer ingredients stored in containers (and, even more so, ingredients stored in containers stored in containers--e.g. [[flour]], [[quarry bush]] leaves, etc.).
* Frozen milk gets cooked into prepared meals as a solid, causing the meal to melt later. {{Bug|2787}}
* High-[[quality]] cooked meals only give a happy [[thought]] if at least one of the ingredients is [[preference|preferred]] by the dwarf eating it. {{Bug|4661}}
* Cooks can combine all the ingredients in a barrel into one massive meal. {{bug|7546}}

Many of the monsters are surprisingly edible, therefore a skilled cook is all you need the next time your [[adventurer mode|adventuring party]] needs to save someone from a [[dragon]].
