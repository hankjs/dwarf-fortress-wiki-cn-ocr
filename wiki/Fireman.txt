'''Fire men''' are exceptionally rare [[construct creature]]s made of [[fire]], found in the [[magma sea]]. They stand at the size of a [[human]], feel no emotion, [[No Exert|no exertion]], don't need to breathe, are [[No Pain|immune to pain]] and [[No Stun|cannot be stunned]]. When a fire man is killed, it leaves behind a [[bar]] of [[ash]] which can be made into [[lye]] or [[potash]]. Because they live in the magma sea and are [[building destroyer]]s, one should be cautious when setting up [[magma forge]]s in the event one of them actually shows up. Despite being made of fire, they can be safely captured and stored in wooden [[cage]]s and are unharmed by touching [[water]]. Fire men are immortal and only die from violence.

Fire men are only dangerous because of their natural heat and fire attacks (a fireball throw and a fire jet throw.) Their punches and kicks are harmless on their own, and their flame body is extremely fragile, so don't be surprised if a baby punches a fire man to death. However, actually killing a fire man can be quite [[fun]], as the resulting burst of flame tends to set nearby creatures on fire.

Some [[dwarves]] [[Preferences|like]] fire men for their ''licks of fire''.

<!-- Reference: Mega Man: Powered Up boss Fire Man -->
Fire men tend to be obsessed with a distorted view of justice, mercilessly attacking those they view as evildoers.

<!-- Reference: Metal Gear Solid V: The Phantom Pain -->
Very rarely, unconscious humans have been known to transform into special types of fire men. These are indestructible, blindly aggressive and can only be controlled by outside sources.

<!-- Reference: Human Torch from Marvel Comics -->
Some fire men are known for their heroic deeds, joining teams of up to four members in order to protect innocents from outworldly threats.

== In real life ==

"Fire man", also spelled "fireman", is an archaic English term for a firefighter.  In real life, they are not made of fire{{Verify}}, and in fact tend to quell it rather than spread it.
