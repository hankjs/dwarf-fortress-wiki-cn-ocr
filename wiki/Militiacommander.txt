The '''militia commander''' is an appointed [[noble]] who serves as the senior leader in the [[military]] command hierarchy of your [[fortress]]. They can be assigned at any point (from either the {{menu icon|n}} [[Nobles screen|nobles screen]] or the {{menu icon|q}} [[squad|squad screen]]), and have no room [[Noble#Needs|requirements]]. The militia commander is only surpassed by the [[general]] in terms of military rank among dwarves who may inhabit a playable fortress. 

The militia commander administrates your armies, allowing to expand your militia with new [[squads]] and assign [[militia captain]]s to serve as squad leaders, but is primarily a figurehead and grants no bonuses unless actively participating in military stuff. They also lead a squad of their own managing their troops assignments, participates in their training, and venture with them on [[missions]] like any other squad leader.

Some [[skill]]s have been reported to aid the role of the militia commander, though none are mandatory for that position. [[Organizer]] speeds up the time to organize [[Training#Organized_squad_training|training]] sessions.  [[Military tactics]] is used when squads are sent into missions.{{verify|Any squad or when his squad is sent? also is it commander specific skill, any squad leader skill, or works for any squad member in the squad. See also: [[DF2014 Talk:Military tactics]]}} [[Ambusher]] skill is also useful for raids where dwarves will attempt to avoid detection.{{verify|Vague. Is it Militia commander specific skill or of many military skills that are useful for any soldier?}}
