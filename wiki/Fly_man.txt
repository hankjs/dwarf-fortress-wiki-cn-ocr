'''Fly men''' are humanoid versions of the common [[fly]] and a [[Creature|species]] of [[animal people]], found in just about every [[savage]] biome but mountains, glacier and tundra. They are also supposed to appear in savage [[pool]]s, but as non-[[vermin]] can't spawn in pools, this never happens. They are a little over half the size of an adult [[dwarf]] and are unlikely to pose a threat to a fortress' inhabitants. All fly men are born as full-sized adults, and with Legendary [[skill]] in [[Climber|climbing]].

Some dwarves [[Preferences|like]] fly men for their ''ability to annoy''.

Despite the rumors you might've heard, fly men are not that great at quantum teleportation science.
