'''Yaks''' are large, [[milk]]able [[domestic animal]]s. They can serve as pack animals and are a common sight in [[Trading|merchant]] [[caravan]]s. They may be either brought on [[embark]] or found in wild populations in [[mountain]]s. The males of the species are known as ''yak bulls'', while the females are known as ''yak cows''.

Yaks are the second largest of all domestic livestock (losing only to [[water buffalo]]s), making them one of the best domestic creatures for a food industry. They provide significant [[food]], [[fat]] and [[bone]]s when [[butcher]]ed, and also serve as a source of [[horn]]s. Yaks eat a lot of grass, so it may be in a player's best interest to give them a separate [[pasture]], so they don't hog all the grass from other animals in a given area.

Some dwarves [[Preferences|like]] yaks for their ''shaggy hair''. Whilst the hair is recovered upon butchering the animal, it cannot be shorn.

{{D for Dwarf}}
Some Yaks are dumber than dwarves, there are rumors about yaks climbing the trees and then starving to death while unable to get down.
