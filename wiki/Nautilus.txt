'''Nautiluses''' are a source of food for fortresses located near the [[ocean]]. They are also one of the few types of creatures, along with [[oyster]]s, [[cave lobster]]s, [[mussel]]s, and [[turtle]]s, that are common sources of [[shell]]s. After being caught by a [[fisherdwarf]], they require [[fish cleaning|cleaning]] at a [[fishery]], which produces a usable shell and an edible nautilus.

According to the raws, nautiluses have 90 tentacles and [[copper]]-based [[blood]] (though the tentacles are not yet implemented as part of their body structure).

Some dwarves [[preference|like]] nautiluses for their ''shells'' and their ''many tentacles''.
