'''Bonobos''' are [[dwarf]]-sized [[Creature|ape]]s who are rarely found inhabiting [[tropical]] [[shrubland]]s and moist broadleaf [[forest]]s, where they appear in groups of five to ten individuals. They are virtually identical to [[chimpanzee]]s in all aspects but name; they are benign meanderers who will only attack dwarves if pushed beyond their limit and will generally simply avoid contact. All members of the species are born with Legendary [[skill]] in [[Climber|climbing]].

Bonobos can be captured in [[cage]] [[trap]]s and [[Animal trainer|trained]] into valuable exotic [[pet]]s. Being slightly smaller than dwarves, bonobos produce few returns when [[butcher]]ed, making using them as livestock a waste, considering their rarity. Bonobo children take two years to grow to full size, and ten years to reach adulthood. Like other apes, they are among the few wild animals in the game who can't naturally swim, and as such will likely drown if thrown into a body of [[water]].

Some dwarves [[Preferences|like]] bonobos for their ''antics''.
