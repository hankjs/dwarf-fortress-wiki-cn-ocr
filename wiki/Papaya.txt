'''Papaya''' is one of the many genera of [[tree]]s found above ground. Like the vast majority of above ground trees, papaya [[wood]] is brown and produces brown products. Papayas have one of the least dense woods, second only to [[feather tree]]s.

Papaya trees bear fruit that can be harvested by setting up a gathering [[zone]]. They can be eaten raw, cooked, or brewed into [[alcohol|papaya wine]].  Papayas only grow on the trunk, so there'll be at most 5-6 per tree, and you'll be unable to harvest a stack of more than three.

Some [[Dwarf|dwarves]] [[Preferences|like]] papaya trees for their ''fruit''.
