'''Pangolins''' are small [[creature]]s found in [[tropical]] plains and [[forest]]s. They spawn one at a time and wander through the map, eating [[vermin|bugs]] along the way. They are only as big as a [[cat]] and will run away if threatened, making them harmless to your [[dwarf]] civilians and an easy target for your [[hunter]]s.

Pangolins can be captured in [[cage]] [[trap]]s and [[Animal trainer|trained]] into low-value [[pet]]s. If a breeding pair is obtained, they can be bred either to populate the fort with more pangolins or to be [[butcher]]ed for [[meat]], though their small size means they create few products. Additionally, pangolins are distinct for being covered in [[Skin|scales]] rather than normal hide, which makes them useless for creating [[leather]].

Some dwarves [[Preferences|like]] pangolins for their ''overlapping scales''.

Despite popular belief, pangolins (alongside [[bat]]s) will ''not'' cause a long-lasting outbreak of any type of disease; therefore workshops do not need to be quarantined or outright abandoned. Nor do face masks (aside from [[armor]]) need to be made.
