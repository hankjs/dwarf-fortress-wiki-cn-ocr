[[Instruments]] are procedurally generated for each world, but if so desired, it is still possible to define custom instruments in the raws by using an [ITEM_INSTRUMENT] token. Most [[tool token]]s can be used, but there are also a few instrument-specific tokens, as listed in the table below.

The information on this page is sourced from the file <code>raw/objects/examples&nbsp;and&nbsp;notes/item_instrument_example.txt</code>, which also includes useful example instrument definitions.

|-
| {{text anchor|PLACED_AS_BUILDING}}
|
| Makes the instrument stationary.

|-
| {{text anchor|DOMINANT_MATERIAL_PIECE}}
|
* instrument piece
| Sets a piece as the central part of the instrument.

|-
| {{text anchor|INSTRUMENT_PIECE}}
|
* token
* tool token
* singular
* plural
* STANDARD/ALWAYS_PLURAL/ALWAYS_SINGULAR
| Defines an instrument piece. ''token'' is the identifier that can be used in other raw tags to refer to this instrument piece. ''tool token'' is the tool which is required (and consumed) during the construction process to create this instrument piece.

If an instrument does not have any pieces, SELF can be used for any argument which needs to be an instrument piece.

|-
| {{text anchor|VOLUME_mB}}
|
* min
* max
| The instrument's volume range, in millibels (100 mB = 1 dB).

|-
| {{text anchor|SOUND_PRODUCTION}}
|
* various tokens
| Defines how a musician can produce sound when using this instrument. Can be used multiple times. Valid tokens and their required additional arguments are:
* PLUCKED_BY_BP, PLUCKED (requires two tokens, actor then target)
* BOWED (two tokens)
* STRUCK_BY_BP, STRUCK (two tokens)
* VIBRATE_BP_AGAINST_OPENING
* BLOW_AGAINST_FIPPLE, BLOW_OVER_OPENING_SIDE, BLOW_OVER_OPENING_END, BLOW_OVER_SINGLE_REED, BLOW_OVER_DOUBLE_REED, BLOW_OVER_FREE_REED
* STRUCK_TOGETHER, SHAKEN
* SCRAPED (two tokens), FRICTION (two tokens)
* RESONATOR
* BAG_OVER_REED (two tokens), AIR_OVER_REED (two tokens), AIR_OVER_FREE_REED (two tokens), AIR_AGAINST_FIPPLE (two tokens)

|-
| {{text anchor|PITCH_CHOICE}}
|
* method
| Defines how the pitch can be varied by the musician. Can be used multiple times. Valid methods are:
* MEMBRANE_POSITION
* SUBPART_CHOICE
* KEYBOARD
* STOPPING_FRET (requires two tokens, first for "string" second for "neck" -- or whatever is being pressed against what), STOPPING_AGAINST_BODY (two tokens), STOPPING_HOLE, STOPPING_HOLE_KEY
* SLIDE
* HARMONIC_SERIES
* VALVE_ROUTES_AIR
* BP_IN_BELL
* FOOT_PEDALS (two token, first is what is being changed e.g. "strings", second is "body" which has pedalboard -- or whatever piece is being stepped on)

|-
| {{text anchor|TUNING}}
|
* method
* instrument piece
| Can be used multiple times. Valid methods are: PEGS, ADJUSTABLE_BRIDGES, CROOKS, TIGHTENING, LEVERS.

|-
| {{text anchor|PITCH_RANGE}}
|
* min pitch
* max pitch
| From the example file:
<blockquote>Pitch is <min>:<max> in cents with middle C at zero.  There are 1200 cents in an octave.  The game verbally differentiates values from -4200 to 4200, but you can go outside that if you like.  The in-game generated instruments will range from roughly C0 to C8 (-4800 to 4800), sometimes beyond for really unusual ones.

        You can also use INDEFINITE_PITCH.

|-
| {{text anchor|INDEFINITE_PITCH}}
|
| May replace {{token|PITCH_RANGE|ins}}.

|-
| {{text anchor|TIMBRE}}
|
* any number of timbre words

|
* min pitch
* max pitch
* any number of timbre words
| See [[#PITCH_RANGE|PITCH_RANGE]] and [[#TIMBRE|TIMBRE]] for possible values. The pitch range overrides the global pitch for a register, but the register timbres are added to the global ones.

|-
| {{text anchor|MUSIC_SKILL}}
|
* skill token
| Which skill should be trained by playing the instrument. Any [[skill token]] is valid, but the in-game generated instruments only use PLAY_KEYBOARD_INSTRUMENT, PLAY_STRINGED_INSTRUMENT, PLAY_WIND_INSTRUMENT, or PLAY_PERCUSSION_INSTRUMENT. Levels in this skill do not seem to have any effect on the quality of music produced. Can only be used once.

|-
| {{text anchor|DESCRIPTION}}
|
* description
| A general description of the completed instrument.  Multiple [DESCRIPTION] tokens can be used in the same definition, with each appearing on a new line.
