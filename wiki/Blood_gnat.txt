'''Blood gnats''' are a type of [[hateable]] [[above ground]] [[vermin]] that are found in swarms near [[pool]]s in [[evil]] areas. They may spawn near [[rot]]ting [[food]], and will inspire unhappy [[thought]]s in [[dwarves]] who hold a particular antipathy towards them. Despite their description, they don't damage dwarves beyond the aforementioned unhappy thought.

Some dwarves [[preference|like]] blood gnats for their ''thirst for blood'' and their ''pulsating lumpy bodies''.
