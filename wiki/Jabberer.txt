'''Jabberers''' are colossal flightless [[Creature|birds]] who live at the deeper levels of subterranean [[caverns]] - the much nastier cousin of the [[elk bird]]. These carnivorous beasts, nearly the size of an [[elephant]], prowl the underground while terrorizing anything that approaches them, these usually being hapless [[Dwarf|dwarves]] who just happened to take the wrong turn on their hauling job. The typical result of a civilian stumbling into a jabberer is a new body for the fortress' cemetery.

Jabberers are a threat due to their great size; they are among the largest creatures in the underground (losing only to [[blind cave ogre]]s, [[forgotten beast]]s and [[cave dragon]]s) and will use all of their strength to tear through unarmed or inexperienced dwarves. Even a heavily armored dwarf is at risk of dying immediately by being grabbed by the head and shaken by the jabberer, causing their upper spine to collapse. When facing jabberers, a powerful [[military]] is essential, though they are also equally vulnerable to [[cage]] [[trap]]s. Uncommonly, the creatures are also encountered in [[goblin]] [[siege]]s, where they are used by the enemy as [[mount]]s.

Jabberers possess a pet value of 1,500; one of the highest in the game, and the great amount of returns they give when [[butcher]]ed means players should consider them more valuable alive than dead. Should a jabberer couple be captured and assigned to a [[nest box]], they can be used to steadily provide the fortress with a force of giant, bloodthirsty and delicious bodyguards. Jabberers can be [[Animal trainer|trained]] not just as [[pet]]s but also as war and hunting beasts, and products made from their parts are [[Item value|worth]] four times as much as those made from common animals.

Unlike most animals, jabberers can't be spawned in the [[object testing arena]].

Some dwarves [[Preferences|like]] jabberers for their ''frightening beaks''.
