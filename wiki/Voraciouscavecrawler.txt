'''Voracious cave crawlers''' are quite nasty [[creature]]s that are seen from time to time in [[caverns]], spawning one at a time and being generally voracious to anything in their path. Although lacking the special abilities of [[Giant cave spider|other, more reliable sources of fun]], they are among the largest creatures found in caverns and as such, will prove a threat to civilians. Voracious cave crawlers do not possess eyes, but can see around themselves through {{token|EXTRAVISION}}.

When they spawn, these beasts will attempt to travel to [[building]]s and [[Building destroyer|destroy them]] even if they aren't in its line of sight. Because of this trait it is relatively simple to capture cave crawlers: restrict access to your underground buildings, but allow a way through that has [[Trap#Cage_Trap|cage traps]] built in the way. They will path through the cage traps and get [[Captured creatures|caught]]. They are very valuable exotic [[pet]]s and can be [[Animal trainer|trained]] with generally no problem. They can be used as a [[mount]] by [[goblin]] [[siege]]rs, and are quite dangerous.{{cite talk|v0.34:Voracious cave crawler}}

Being invertebrates, voracious cave crawlers have a vulnerable brain and can be killed with a few lucky blows to the head. Voracious cave crawler products are worth four times more than those of other creatures. Despite their description, they do not actually have any feet or even legs. Unlike most beasts, they can't be spawned in the [[object testing arena]].

Some dwarves [[Preferences|like]] voracious cave crawlers for their ''scary mouths''.
