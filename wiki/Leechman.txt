'''Leech men''' are humanoid versions of the common [[leech]] and a [[Creature|species]] of unremarkable [[animal people]], found in [[savage]] [[pool]]s and [[lake]]s. They are a bit over half the size of [[dwarf|dwarves]] when adults and spawn in groups of 1-5 individuals. They have no legs and move about by crawling. They will automatically suck [[blood]] out of enemies on successful bite attacks.

Like other savage animal people, leech men may occasionally join [[civilization]]s, becoming full-fledged citizens, who may appear in your fortress as [[visitor]]s, or be playable in [[adventurer mode]].

Some dwarves [[Preferences|like]] leech men for their ''feeding habits''.

==Trivia==
* Leech men have no legs using ``ANIMAL_PERSON_LEGLESS`` template, but the sprite depicts them with humanoid legs.

One of the more evil residents of savage lakes, '''leech men''' have been proven quite a challenge to kill, even by the most skilled dwarven leech hunters.

Not to be confused with [[Noble]]
