'''Yarn''' is a type of thread that is [[spinner|spun]] from [[animal]] [[wool]]. Only a {{catlink|Shearable|select group of animals}} have hair of a quality to be considered wool; these animals may be [[butcher]]ed or [[shear]]ed to produce wool. [[Yarn]] can be [[weaver|woven]] into [[cloth]] at a [[loom]]. Yarn cloth can then be used to create a variety of textile products such as [[bag]]s, [[clothing]], [[rope]], or [[crafts]].

A [[dwarf]] with the [[spinner]] [[labor]] enabled can process wool into yarn at a [[farmer's workshop]] with the "Spin Thread" job order. With a [[loom]], any dwarf with the [[weaver]] labor enabled can [[standing orders|automatically]] turn any yarn, or only dyed yarn, into cloth.
