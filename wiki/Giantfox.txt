{{D for Dwarf}}

Ancient [[human]] tales tell of a vicious giant fox created by one of the human [[Deity|deities]]. It is much greater than even a [[giant elephant]], possessing nine tails and consisting of unusual material that makes it virtually indestructible. It is also capable of firing an explosive projectile from its mouth, and it equally despises all mortal beings. Thankfully such tales are mere fiction, but [[Armok]] Himself would likely be impressed by the idea, so human imagination is to be commended.
