'''Eagle men''' are [[animal people]] variants of the common [[eagle]], who can be found in most [[savage]] [[biome]]s, spawning in groups of anywhere between 1-3 individuals, and are generally content to keep to themselves. In terms of size, they are a little over half the weight of the average [[dwarf]]. All eagle men are born with Legendary [[skill]] in [[Climber|climbing]].

Like other savage animal people, eagle men can join [[civilization]]s, become [[historical figure]]s, appear as [[visitor]]s and be playable in [[adventurer mode]].

Some dwarves [[Preferences|like]] eagle men for their ''high soaring''.

<!-- Reference: 'Hotel California' by, of course, The Eagles-->
Some eagle men musicians will occasionally sing songs about a strange inn that travelers can exit any time they like, but can never truly leave. Such songs are always accompanied by a two-minute solo on a stringed instrument.
