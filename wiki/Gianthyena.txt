'''Giant hyenas''' are extremely large, six times the [[size]] of an average dwarf, close to as large as a [[yak]]. Thanks to the <tt>[LARGE_PREDATOR]</tt> [[creature token|token]] they inherit from their basal kin, they're also extremely aggressive. Combined with their pack behavior, appearing in groups of 5-15 individuals, giant hyenas are (unsurprisingly) ''extremely'' dangerous, and will rip apart an unfortunate dwarf faster than he can scream. Should not be approached without large and experienced military [[squad|hunting parties]] in full armor; the proceeds of such a clash could feed the fortress for a while.

Some dwarves [[Preferences|like]] giant hyenas for their ''distinctive laugh'' and their ''coordinated hunting''.
