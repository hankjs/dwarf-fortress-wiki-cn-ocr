'''Teacher''' skill is improved by leading demonstrations, notable demonstrations during [[military]] [[training]] sessions, or demonstrations in a guildhall. In military training sessions, dwarves with a [[combat skill]] might organize demonstrations in order to pass the knowledge to other squad members, who gain [[student]] skill; and in a guildhall, a dwarf with a relevant skill in or of that guild, might hold demonstrations to pass on knowledge to other dwarves currently idling in the same meeting area as the teacher assigned to that guildhall. This skill is also used by [[scholar]]s to teach their colleagues. On the teacher's side, both the skill level in the skill taught, along with the teacher skill level, have an influence on how fast a skill is learned by a student (on the student's side, concentration and the student skill affect learning rate).

Even a novice skill level in a skill to be taught is enough to lead a dmonstration.
