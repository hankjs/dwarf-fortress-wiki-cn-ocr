'''Tapir men''' are humanoid versions of the common [[tapir]] and a [[Creature|species]] of unremarkable [[animal people]], found in [[savage]] [[tropical]] most broadleaf [[forest]]s. They are a little over twice the weight of a [[dwarf]], and therefore should be approached with caution.

Like other savage animal people, tapir men may occasionally join [[civilization]]s, becoming full-fledged citizens who may appear in your fortress as [[visitor]]s or be playable in [[adventurer mode]].

As the animal person template does not remove it, tapir women produce milk.

Some dwarves [[Preferences|like]] tapir men for their ''floppy noses''.
