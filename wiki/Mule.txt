'''Mules''' are [[domestic animal]]s who are often used as pack animals by [[merchant]]s. All mules are male in ''Dwarf Fortress'', and as such they are unable to breed. For the common dwarven fortress, they are nothing but living [[meat]], and their inability to breed, coupled with the fact that they cannot produce [[milk]] or [[yarn]], like other large herbivores, makes them a poor choice for a [[meat industry]]. They are [[grazer]]s, and as such require a [[pasture]] to survive.

Despite their similarities to horses, mules are not ridable [[mount]]s in [[adventure mode]]. (Donkeys are also not ridable mounts.)

Some dwarves [[Preferences|like]] mules for their ''stubbornness''.

==In real life==
In real life, mules are the offspring of a male [[donkey]] (jack) and a female [[horse]] (mare). They are sterile, which the game simulates by making all mules male, though female mules do exist. Interspecies breeding is not yet a feature in ''DF'', so you can't breed mules by crossing a donkey with a horse in-game, which consequently means the only way of acquiring these animals is to bring them on [[embark]], via [[trading]], or from being brought with [[migrants]].
