'''Mud men''' are extremely rare [[construct creature]]s made of solid [[mud]], found exclusively at the third layer of the [[caverns]]. Like other construct creatures, they are non-sentient, [[No Pain|feel no pain]] or fear, [[No Stun|cannot be stunned]] and don't need to breathe. They are as large as [[human]]s and are level 2 [[building destroyer]]s. Mud men are immortal and only die to violence.

Mud is not a particularly strong material, and even an unarmed [[dwarf]] civilian should be able to fight them one-on-one and emerge victorious with only a few bruises. An armored squad will make even quicker work of them, making them one of the less dangerous elemental men. When killed, mud men turn into a glob of mud which can't be used for anything. In [[adventurer mode]], the player can smell mud men from a distance with {{k|o}}, with them being appropriately described as smelling like "mud".

Some dwarves [[Preferences|like]] mud men for their ''peculiar smell''.
