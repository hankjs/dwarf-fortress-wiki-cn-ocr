While ''Dwarf Fortress'' is primarily keyboard-controlled, there are certain areas in the game that have '''mouse control'''.  These are, however, rather rare, and therefore easy to document.

== General controls ==

In most instances of mouse control, the controls are as follows:
* Left-click to select an option. This includes list items, tabs, map tiles and various controls.
* Right-click to scroll a list downward (in some cases to cycle tabs) or to move the cursor.
* Right-click on map border to move view.
Double-left click currently only selects all items in a tab on the "Move Goods to Depot"-screen.

== Mouse control support ==

Menus that support mouse control are:
* [[Advanced world generation]]
* Creature creation screen in the [[object testing arena]]
* Sound menu
* Local image export menu
* [[Designation]]s menu (but not sub-menus)
** You can also use the mouse to do designations, for example, clicking a tile to have it mined.
* [[Burrow]]s
* [[Noble]]s screen
* [[Military]] screen
* Custom [[stockpile]] settings
* Health screen (both individual and in the status screen)
* Economic stone settings
* "Move goods to [[Depot]]" screen

== Mouse control requirement ==

The only area which currently requires mouse control is the [[world painter]] screen.

Note: All information on this page is true as of vanilla 0.40.19 - all earlier versions may have to be verified independently. Mods such as DFHack may provide you with full mouse-clicky goodness.

== Bugs ==
* Resizing the window during the intro video can cause mouse control to only work in one corner of the screen.{{bug|3861}}
