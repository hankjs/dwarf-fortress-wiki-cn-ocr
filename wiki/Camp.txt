'''Camps''' ([[File:icon_site_camp.png]] / {{Raw Tile|☼|6:0:1}}) are a type of [[site]],  usually inhabited by [[bandit]]s, as well as a temporary [[structure]] built by [[Army|traveling groups]].

[[Refugee]]s, nomads, and migrants are known to set up "camps" when stopping for the night - not camps in the same sense as the sites themselves, but merely ad-hoc resting places, despite the appearance of buildings in the form of tents, with cloth or leather walls, which are removed once the group resumes travel. They may also light [[campfire]]s.

In addition, camps are set up by [[invader]] armies at both their origin point and their destination, albeit at different times. For example, if a local lord mentions that an [[army]] is on the march toward a location, groups of soldiers and citizens of the invading civilization can be found outside of the invader's origin, and at a later time, outside of the invader's destination. Similarly, refugees from the invaded site might also set up camps outside the town.

In any case, if you are not attacked by the inhabitants of either sort of camp, you can ask why they're traveling and get an idea of who these folk are.

== Bandit camps ==

[[Bandit]] groups build permanent camps. Unlike [[fort]]s, there are no constructions within a camp, not even the tents that army camps create. 

Bandits store their loot at the center of the site in [[chest]]s and [[bag]]s. They can contain a number of items, with a variety of [[finished goods]], [[armor]], [[weapon]]s and [[coin]]s stolen from their parent [[civilization]].

== Adventurer camps ==
Adventurers used to be able to {{Adv menu icon|b}} build camps anywhere outside the borders of existing sites. They would share the same world map icon with bandit camps, however, they look much different in close proximity, and interestingly, you could quick travel inside them and out of them (but not into them). [[Claim]]ing the camp would turn you into a lord, and you would then be able to recruit [[hearthperson]]s to your site. If you turned your entire site into a [[tavern]] its residents would start performing in it. However despite the button existing (and labeled "coming soon") this feature has been removed and not yet reintroduced.

=== Underworld [[exploit]] ===

If you make a zone inside your camp several levels down, assign hearthpeople to that zone, retire and unretire them, you may very well end up starting the game in the [[Underworld]]. In fact, any adventurer with a background of being a hearthperson to that site may start in the Underworld as well.

This behavior can be exploited – by having 2 or more adventuring party members, you could tell one of them to wait and move enough distance to unload them off the game field, then walk back to where they would be and hit the tab button to switch over to them; the game will transport the camera over to the waiting adventurer on the surface, thus permitting escape as you can then fast travel or wait to recover the remaining units that would otherwise be trapped down below. You can also build structures in the Underworld while on the surface this way.
