The '''captain of the guard''' is an appointed [[noble]] position in charge of internal security of a [[fortress]]. They have simple [[zone|room]] requirements.

Once a fortress has elected a mayor and reached 50 population, the position of [[sheriff]] will disappear (any appointed sheriffs will be reverted into civilians automatically) and the position of captain of the guard becomes available in the {{menu icon|n}} [[Nobles screen|nobles screen]]. In the {{menu icon|q}} [[Military interface|military screen]], a "captain of the guard" [[squad]] (with no members yet assigned) will appear at the head of the squadron list. A captain of the guard can be assigned through both screens.

The captain of the guard leads the [[fortress guard]], which, alongside its regular military duties, aids in the enforcement of [[justice]] by investigating crimes, [[Dungeon (zone)|capturing]] criminals, and delivering beatings. As such, the captain of the guard functions as both a sheriff and a [[militia captain]]. Once your fortress has reached a middling population, be prepared to dig out and furnish rooms for your middling captain to satisfy their additional room requirements. See [[fortress guard]] for why you might want your guardsman to be the ''opposite'' of a man of justice.

The number of cages and/or restrains needed to satisfy the captain of the guard can be accessed by checking the {{menu icon|j}} justice menu and switching to the Fortress guard tab. The first line should state the quantity required. This is associated with negative thoughts about lack of cages and restrains.

When [[talking]] to the captain of the guard, adventurers can ask to join the [[fortress guard]] (as the dwarven equivalent of a [[hearthperson]]); their acceptance requires some [[reputation]] and (probably{{verify}}) an empty squad position.
