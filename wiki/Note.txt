{{removed feature}}

'''Notes''' were comments that you could leave around your fortress. Instead, now many elements of the game can be renamed:
* Names and titles of all creatures
* [[Squad]]s
* All buildings, not including constructions
* [[Stockpile]]s
* [[Zone]]s, [[location]]s, and [[burrows]]

Notes were removed in 0.50 and later versions of Dwarf Fortress, however this feature has been reinstated with a [[DFHack]] plugin.
