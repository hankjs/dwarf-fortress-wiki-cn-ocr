'''Elk men''' are [[animal people]] variants of the common [[elk]] who can be found in [[savage]] [[temperate]] [[grassland]]s and [[tundra]]s. They spawn in groups of 1-5 individuals and are generally content to keep to themselves, but will fight back if provoked. In terms of size, they are significantly larger than [[dwarves]] and will easy cave in their skulls with their hooves when it comes to a fight.

Like other savage animal people, they can join [[civilization]]s, become [[historical figure]]s, appear as [[visitor]]s and be playable in [[adventurer mode]].

Some dwarves [[Preferences|like]] elk men for their ''grace''.
