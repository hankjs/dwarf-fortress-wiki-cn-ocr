:{{for/see|an explanation of how to use the various graphics types|[[Graphics]]}}

The <code>[OBJECT:GRAPHICS]</code> [[token]] defines the use of various tile-based graphics in the game. As of version 50.01, graphics tokens have been greatly expanded to accommodate the release of the Steam & Itch premium version. These tokens, and explanations on how to use them, are listed below; the list will expand as the tokens are discovered and understood.

== Creature Graphics ==
Creature graphics are found within graphics_creature_x files (such as graphics_creature_domestic or graphics_creature_layered). All graphics files must begin with the file name, followed by the <code>[OBJECT:GRAPHICS]</code> type that tells the game that the file contains graphics definitions. A more detailed explanation on how to use these can be found in [[Graphics#Creature_Graphics|creature graphics]].

=== Types ===
{| {{prettytable}}
|- bgcolor="#dddddd"
! Type
! Arguments
! Description

|-
| {{text anchor|CREATURE_GRAPHICS}}
|
* [[Creature token|creature id]]
| The simplest and most common form of creature graphics for defining one sprite for each [[#Condition|basic condition]]. 

Further conditions are required for this to function following the [[Graphics#Basic_Graphics|creature graphics]] format. Accepts [[Graphics#Large_Graphics|large graphics tokens]].

Additionally used to start defining a [[Graphics#Layered_Graphics|layered graphics]] set.

|-
| {{text anchor|CREATURE_CASTE_GRAPHICS}} 
|
* [[Creature token|creature id]]
* [[Caste|Caste ID]]
| Nearly the same as {{token|CREATURE_GRAPHICS|g}}, but allows a separate sprite to be defined for each caste.
A simple alternative to [[Graphics#Layered Graphics|Layered Graphics]].

Requires conditions defined in [[Graphics#Basic_Graphics|creature graphics]] format. Accepts [[Graphics#Large_Graphics|large graphics tokens]].

|-
| {{text anchor|STATUE_CREATURE_GRAPHICS}} 
|
* [[Creature token|creature id]]
| Format for beginning a [[Graphics#Statue_Graphics|creature statue definition]]. Defines a 1x2 vertical rectangle to be displayed when a statue depicts one of these creatures.

|-
| {{text anchor|STATUE_CREATURE_CASTE_GRAPHICS}} 
|
* [[Creature token|creature id]]
* [[Caste|Caste ID]]
| Format for beginning a [[Graphics#Statue_Graphics|creature statue definition]] while specifying caste. Defines a 1x2 vertical rectangle to be displayed when a statue depicts one of these creatures.

|-
| {{text anchor|TILE_GRAPHICS_RECTANGLE}}
|
* [[Creature token|creature id]]
| Graphics for a 3x2 rectangle; for creatures, this is used exclusively for representing Forgotten Beasts based on their body parts. Uses [[Graphics#Forgotten_Beast_Graphics|forgotten beast graphics]]. It's also, however, used for interface graphics, see [[graphics_interface.txt]].

|}

=== Conditions ===
Different graphics can be defined for the same creature based on some properties about it. Below is a list of all the basic "creature texture" types that can be used as additional conditions to various basic sprites.

{| {{prettytable}}
|- bgcolor="#dddddd"
! Condition
! Description
|-
| {{text anchor|DEFAULT}} || The default condition that will be displayed unless overwritten by a more specific one below.

|-
| {{text anchor|LAW_ENFORCE}} || Displayed if the unit is law enforcement.

|-
| {{text anchor|TAX_ESCORT}} || Displayed if the unit escorts a tax collector (unused).

|-
| {{text anchor|ANIMATED}} || Displayed if the creature is raised from the dead using an I_EFFECT:ANIMATE interaction.

|-
| {{text anchor|GHOST}} || Displayed if the creature is a ghost.

|-
| {{text anchor|ADVENTURER}} || Displayed if the creature is an adventurer.

|-
| {{text anchor|CORPSE}} || Displayed for corpses.

|}

=== Basic creature sprite types ===

An individual sprite can be of any of the following classes. If "accepts secondary" is "yes", it can also have an extra condition tacked on at the end.

{| {{prettytable}}
|- bgcolor="#dddddd"
! Condition
! Description
|-
| {{text_anchor|Basic Condition}} || Any of the [[Graphics token#Conditions|above conditions]] can be used on their own, as the default for that condition class.

|-
| {{text_anchor|Unit type}} || Any [[Unit type token]] can be used. You may also append a [[Graphics token#Conditions|basic condition as above]] to further specify.

|-
| {{text_anchor|Position}} || Any [[Position token]] can be used, such as MONARCH, BROKER etc. All position tokens are raw-defined; any modded positions can have their own graphics. You may also append a [[Graphics token#Conditions|basic condition as above]] to further specify.

|-
| {{text_anchor|LIST_ICON}} || The default icon for this creature in lists, such as [[Arena mode]] or overall training.

|-
| {{text_anchor|EGG}} || The sprite for a clutch of eggs.

|-
| {{text_anchor|SKELETON}} || The sprite for a rotten corpse.

|-
| {{text_anchor|SKELETON_WITH_SKULL}} || The sprite for a rotten corpse that can have a [[totem]] made from it.

|-
| {{text_anchor|GLOW}}{{version|51.01-beta26}} || The creature is in the [dark]. Graphical replacement for {{token|GLOWTILE}}.

|-
| {{text_anchor|GLOW_LEFT_GONE}}{{version|51.01-beta26}} || As {{token|GLOW|graphics}}, but with their left eye missing. If the sprite is facing forwards, then the visually leftmost eye should remain.

|-

|-
| {{text_anchor|GLOW_CHILD}}{{version|51.01-beta26}} || A child creature is in darkness. Does not have wound states.

|}

=== Layered Conditions ===
Layers aren't very useful on their own, so they come with a set of conditions to define how when they are displayed and how they interact. Unless otherwise stated, a layer will only render if all of its conditions are true.

{| {{prettytable}}
|- bgcolor="#dddddd"
! Token
! Arguments
! Type
! Description

|-
| {{text_anchor|LAYER_GROUP}} || 
| General{{verify}}
| Begins a layer group. Only the first-matching layer in a group will be rendered, so list more specific items at the beginning of the layer group and more general items towards the end.

|-
| {{text_anchor|LAYER_SET}} ||
* condition
| Creature<br>Graphics
| Begins defining a layer set for a creature's graphics.  Valid values of ''condition'' are DEFAULT, PORTRAIT{{version|50.13}}, BABY:DEFAULT{{version|51.01-beta20}}, CHILD:DEFAULT{{version|51.01-beta20}}, or CORPSE Valid values for basic conditions may not work.{{verify}}

|-
| {{text_anchor|LS_PALETTE}}{{version|50.13}} ||
*  name
|| Layer<br>Set
|| Begins defining a palette for the layer set. Its name can be referenced by {{token|USE_PALETTE|g}}. Unlike the palettes used to render all [[descriptor color token]]s, it can be of arbitrary length.

* file name
| Palette
| The file name of the 8bit RGBA (sometimes called 32bit) in the <tt>/graphics/images</tt> folder of the mod, such as <tt>images/portraits/dwarf_portrait_body_palette.png</tt>.

|-
| {{text_anchor|LS_PALETTE_DEFAULT}}{{version|50.13}} ||
* integer 
| Palette
| Defines the default row of a layer set palette, conventionally 0. The exact color values on this row will be replaced on layer images with the colors in the same column, based on what row is passed as an argument to {{token|USE_PALETTE|g}}.

|-
| {{text_anchor|LG_CONDITION_BP}}{{version|50.13}} ||
*  selection criteria BY_TYPE, BY_CATEGORY, BY_TOKEN
*  category, type, or token
|| Layer<br>Group
|| Allows the entire layer group (rather than an individual layer) to be switched on and off depending on the conditions of a body part. Should accept the same tokens {{token|CONDITION_BP|g}} does. {{verify}}

For example, a condition representing a right handed mitten or glove would be defined as:

<code>[CONDITION_ITEM_WORN:BY_TOKEN:RH:GLOVES:ITEM_GLOVES_MITTENS]</code>
Also accepts the input <code>ANY_HELD</code> or <code>WIELD</code> (e.g. <code>WIELD:WEAPON:ANY</code>), though ANY_HELD has been bugged since v50.14.

|-
| {{text_anchor|SHUT_OFF_IF_ITEM_PRESENT}} ||
* BY_CATEGORY / BY_TOKEN
* [[Body_token#CATEGORY|category]] / [[Body_token#BP|body part token]]
* Armor type
* Item ID(s)
|| Armor || Causes the current layer to not be rendered if the creature has one of the items worn or equipped. Also accepts the input <code>ANY_HELD</code> or <code>WIELD</code> (e.g. <code>WIELD:WEAPON:ANY</code>). Note that ANY_HELD has been bugged since v50.14.

|-
| {{text_anchor|CONDITION_CASTE}} ||

|-
| {{text_anchor|CONDITION_DYE}} ||
* dye color
|| Armor
|| Represents which color the clothing is dyed. Partially-working.{{version|50.15}}
Takes a [[descriptor color]]. Vanilla [[dye]] options:

|| Checks if the clothing is dyed.{{version|50.15}}

|-
| {{text_anchor|CONDITION_MATERIAL_FLAG}} ||
* material flag
|| Material || Changes graphics based on the material an equipped item is made of. Specifying multiple of this condition for a layer uses the "AND" instead of "OR" logical operator, whether placed in the same line or on separate lines. Valid material flags are similar to [[Reaction#Full_token_list|reactant conditions]] including:
* WOVEN_ITEM
* ANY_X_MATERIAL
:with X being:
:* PLANT, SILK, YARN, LEATHER, WOOD, SHELL, BONE, STONE, GEM, TOOTH, HORN, PEARL
* IS_DIVINE_MATERIAL
* NOT_ARTIFACT

* material token
|| Material || Changes graphics based on the material an equipped item is made of. Valid material types are <code>INORGANIC</code> or <code>METAL:IRON</code> where iron can be replaced with any weapons-grade metal. General [[material token]]s are '''not''' functional. {{token|CONDITION_MATERIAL_FLAG|g}} is a better option for any material condition other than metal.

|-
| {{text_anchor|CONDITION_PROFESSION_CATEGORY}}{{version|50.01-v50.13}} <br /> Note: This condition is bugged and doesn't work since DFv50.14.||
* [[Unit type token#Profession Categories|profession category token(s)]]
|| General
|| Checks the profession category of the creature to act as a condition. Multiple profession category tokens can be supplied as additional arguments, and will be valid for any of them. You can also use multiple of these tokens instead of listing them all in a single line, but this is functionally identical. Valid Profession tokens which are not categories will be ignored; values that do not match any existing Profession will be treated as <code>NONE</code> and thus apply to doctors, military, etc..

|-
| {{text_anchor|CONDITION_RANDOM_PART_INDEX}} ||
* identifier
* integer index
* integer range
|| General
|| Chooses a random layer among layers with a CONDITION_RANDOM_PART_INDEX with the same identifier. Index is which option this condition is, out of Range number of options. Ex:

| {{text_anchor|TISSUE_MIN_LENGTH}} ||
* integer
|| Tissue
|| Checks the current {{token|CONDITION_TISSUE_LAYER|g}}'s LENGTH [[Creature_token#TISSUE_LAYER_APPEARANCE_MODIFIER|appearance modifier]]. Is true if the LENGTH is greater than the integer input.

|-
| {{text_anchor|TISSUE_MAX_LENGTH}} ||
* integer
|| Tissue
|| Checks the current {{token|CONDITION_TISSUE_LAYER|g}}'s LENGTH [[Creature_token#TISSUE_LAYER_APPEARANCE_MODIFIER|appearance modifier]]. Is true if the LENGTH is less than the integer input.

* integer
* tile page id
* x position
* y position
| Tissue
| Checks if a tissue is sufficiently curly, and if so swaps to display a different image. The new image is defined by the tile page ID, x position, and y position.

This condition should be within a [LAYER:... ] that has a similar graphic to the on in the TISSUE_SWAP.
The current {{token|CONDITION_TISSUE_LAYER|g}} group must also include a {{token|TISSUE_MIN_LENGTH|g}}.

|-
| {{text_anchor|ITEM_QUALITY}}{{version|50.13}} ||
