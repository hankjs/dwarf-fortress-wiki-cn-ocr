[[File:battle_axe_sprite_preview.png|right]]A '''battle axe''' is an [[attack types|edge]] [[weapon]] that is essentially a heavy, sharp blade mounted at the end of a haft, roughly parallel to it but set somewhat forwards (in elementary mechanical terms it's just a wedge on the end of a lever). Battle axes have the same range of attacks as larger [[great axe]]s, but with reduced contact area and penetration on their "hack" edged attack.

Battle axes use and train the [[Combat skill|axeman]] skill ("Axedwarf" in dwarf mode). Dwarves can [[forge]] battle axes out of any weapon-grade [[metal]], though those with [[material science|superior edge properties]] are more effective. Almost all dwarves can equip battle axes; [[Weapon#Size|some must use two hands]].

A battle axe may also be used as a tool for [[wood cutting|chopping down trees]], and the material of the axe determines how fast a tree can be felled. Any dwarf that performs wood cutting will pick up an axe (if one is available) and not put it down until they are either no longer assigned the Wood Cutting [[labor]] or required to pick up different [[equipment]] for a new job.  You can make use of this to arm many of your non-[[military]] dwarves with axes, although if you do designate one or more trees for wood-cutting ({{Menu icon|l}}), all those dwarves will rush out to cut them down, one per tree designated. [[Wood]]en training axes are no longer able to be use to cut down trees -- they must be metal (or an artifact).

== Forging and melting ==
* Metal battle axes cost '''one''' [[metal]] bar to [[forge]], or '''four''' [[adamantine]] wafers.
* When a non-adamantine metal battle axe is [[melt|melted down]], it will return '''1.2''' metal bars, for an '''efficiency of 120%'''.
* When an adamantine battle axe is melted down, it will produce '''1.2''' wafers, for an '''efficiency of 30%'''.
