'''Swan men''' are humanoid versions of the common [[swan]] and a [[Creature|species]] of [[animal people]]; notable for being the largest playable species capable of flying in adventure mode, found in some [[savage]] [[temperate]] [[lake]]s and [[marsh]]es. They are a little over half the size of an adult [[dwarf]] and are unlikely to pose a threat to a fortress' inhabitants.

Like other savage animal people, swan men may occasionally join [[civilization]]s, becoming full-fledged citizens who may appear in your fortress as [[visitor]]s or be playable in [[adventurer mode]].

Some dwarves [[Preferences|like]] swan men for their ''beauty''.
