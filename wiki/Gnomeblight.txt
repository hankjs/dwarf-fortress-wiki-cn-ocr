'''Gnomeblight''' is a poisonous [[Extract|extract]] made from [[kobold bulb]]s, prepared by an [[herbalist]] at a [[still]] using the "Extract from plant" job. As a [[Syndrome|poison]], gnomeblight causes moderate necrosis to both [[Mountain gnome|mountain]] and [[Dark gnome|dark gnomes]], though currently there exists no easy way to apply it. It is extracted into a [[vial]]. 1 kobold bulb will yield 5 units of gnomeblight, worth 100☼ each, for a total of 500☼ per bulb.

There is a work around to apply it (from the forums):
# Build your gnome [[cage]] in a sealable room, then link it to a [[lever]].
# Using a [[garbage dump]] activity zone, place one or more barrels of gnomeblight on top of the cage.
# Forbid all of the gnomeblight, but not the barrel(s) themselves.
# Wait until a [[caravan]] arrives.
# Order the gnomeblight barrel(s) to be taken to the [[trade depot]]. Since the gnomeblight itself is forbidden, it will be dumped onto the floor.
# Seal the room and pull the lever.
# Watch the gnomes walk around in the pool of gnomeblight and slowly dissolve.
