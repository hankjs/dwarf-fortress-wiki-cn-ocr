The '''appraiser''' [[skill]] relates to [[trading]] and item [[value]] estimation and [[zone]] value estimation. In order to see your fortress' monetary value estimates in the [[status]] bar, as well as any individual item values from your [[Record keeper|stockpile records]], your [[broker]] must be at least a [[Skill#Skill level names|Novice]] (level 1) appraiser. (Note that this is not necessary for the display of item [[quality]], which can always be seen via the indicators bracketing the item names.)

The [[trade depot]]'s current operator gains [[experience]] in the appraiser skill the first time the trading screen is opened for each caravan visit, but the item valuations in the trade depot are determined by your broker's appraiser skill, not the current trade depot operator's. (You can, however, reassign the position of broker to your fortress representative to display item values at the depot.) Appraiser has no associated assignable [[labor]]s. Graphically, they wear all-black clothing, with the default [[Settings#Dye_display|setting]].

A good way to train another dwarf is to assign them as the fortress' broker, make them go to the trade depot to start trading, but then exit and assign the "main" broker again and make them do the actual trading. This is a very effective way of training the skill, as simply opening the trade interface will instantly turn a completely inexperienced dwarf into a Skilled appraiser (level 4), in the case of dwarf merchants. Don't expect the same gain when trading with [[Elf|elves]] or the very first dwarf caravan, as they bring far fewer goods.
In general the experience gain seems to be at most (actual) trade goods value divided by 10 (and at least trade goods value divided by 20) and also at least 1 experience point per item, take note that the trade good value after the trade agreement increases are applied to the traders goods is used.

(Note: Each of your broker's successes/failures is recorded in the world log and on the dwarf's [[thoughts and preferences]] screen, and can be reflected in any later [[engraving]]s in your fortress. To avoid this, use a special [[burrow]] for your depot and broker to isolate it.)

The appraiser skill also impacts the '''precision''' of your value estimations, even outside of trading; with only middling appraisers (or worse), the listed value of your items will be rounded to one significant figure, and the rounding will be rather erratic depending on the type of item. For better or for worse, this tends to round the value of items up, sometimes to an insane degree. Of course, since you host all trades you engage in, the [[merchants]] will have no choice but to accept that your 140-dwarfbuck [[gems]] are actually 1000 dwarfbucks apiece, for example, but they will still demand a profit in a trade which values the gems only as a 140-dwarfbuck gems apiece (and not at 1000 dwarfbucks). Also [[megabeasts]] are not fooled by those marked-up valuations, as the real internally stored values for export and created wealth are used (and not the bogus value estimates of a ie. dabbling appraiser used to display the created/exported wealth for the player).

A [[broker]] must be assigned in the [[Noble#Menu|nobles menu]] in order for [[zone]]s to have their value accurately displayed. Like items, the accuracy of the zone's value depends on the appraiser skill, which in this case is particularly relevant to temples and guildhalls:

[[Temple]] (default value thresholds, these are tripled with Hard economic [[Difficulty#Temples|difficulty]]):
* 0–2,000☼ → Shrine
* 2,000–10,000☼ → Temple
* +10,000☼ → Temple Complex 

[[Guildhall]]  (default value thresholds, these are tripled with Hard economic [[Difficulty#Guilds|difficulty]]):
* 0–2,000☼ → Meeting Place
* 2,000–10,000☼ → Guildhall
* +10,000☼ → Grand Guildhall
