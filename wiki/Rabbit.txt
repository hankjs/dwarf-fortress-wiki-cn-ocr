:''Not to be confused with [[hare]]s.''

{{creaturedesc}}

'''Rabbits''' are small [[domestic animal]]s that can also be found roaming [[temperate]] plains. Because of their tiny size, they will not provide [[food]] even when mature. This means they are not usable as livestock, nor recommended as hunting game. Wild rabbits will not spawn during the [[Calendar|winter]]. Male rabbits are referred to as ''buck rabbits'', while females are called ''doe rabbits'' and babies are called ''bunnies''.

They make decent [[pet]]s for dwarves, but rabbits possess low pet value (tied with the [[cavy]] and [[chinchilla]] as the lowest such values of all animals), which does not make them very profitable in trade, and they don't give any meat when butchered. Non-pet rabbits will require a [[pasture]] to survive. Be warned that rabbits do indeed breed ''like rabbits'' (as it were), and enough of them can strip a pasture bare.

Some dwarves [[Preferences|like]] rabbits for their ''ears'' and their ''ability to burrow''.
