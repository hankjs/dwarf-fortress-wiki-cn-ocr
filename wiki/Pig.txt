'''Pigs''' are mid-size [[Domestic animal|livestock]] [[Creature|animals]]. The females can be [[milk]]ed by a [[dwarf]] with the [[Milker|milking]] labor at a [[farmer's workshop]] with an empty [[bucket]]. Unlike most other livestock, pigs don't need to graze, and thus each pig can be assigned to a 1×1 [[pasture]] without any grass, for example an inside rock tile (you may think of it as stables). They are therefore a great choice for pasture-poor biomes, as, like [[dog]]s, they do not need a food source, but, unlike dogs, can be milked. 

The males are called ''boars'', but they should not be confused with the [[wild boar]], which is a different species. The females are called ''sows'' and their offspring are called ''piglets''.

Some dwarves [[Preferences|like]] pigs for their ''snorts'' and their ''sense of smell''.

{{D for Dwarf}}
Due to a bug with how the planting of seeds is handled, pig tails are considered similar enough to pigtail seeds to be able to plant pigtails. This is due to the fact that “pigtail” and “pig tail” are designated as the same thing when the game decides what is eligible to be planted. You can’t butcher pigtails though, because the butchery process looks in the raws.

They are not to be confused with particularly obnoxious [[noble]]s (or, for that matter, certain forms of human [[Fortress guard|law enforcement]]).
