'''Armadillo men''' are [[animal people]] variants of the common [[armadillo]] who can be found in [[savage]] [[tropical]] regions. They spawn in groups of 5-10 individuals and are generally content to keep to themselves. In terms of size, they are a little over half the weight of the average [[dwarf]].

Like other savage animal people, armadillo men can join [[civilization]]s, become [[historical figure]]s, appear as [[visitor]]s and be playable in [[adventurer mode]].

Some [[dwarves]] [[Preferences|like]] armadillo men for their ''thick, bony armor plates''.

<!-- Reference: Armadillo men often wear 10-gallon hats (cowboy hats) in fictional works such as Dillon from the video game "Dillon's Rolling Western" for the PlayStation 3; Toothpick from "Sly Cooper: Thieves in Time" for the Nintendo 3DS; or Curly, Billy Bob, and Billy rock from the comic "Armadillo Justice". It could also refer to Andy the Armadillo, the mascot of the Texas Roadhouse chain of restaurants.-->
Armadillo men do not, in fact, have accents. Nor do they wear [[size|37,854 cm<sup>3</sup>]] hats.
