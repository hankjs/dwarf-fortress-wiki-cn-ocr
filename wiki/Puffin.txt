'''Puffins''' are a species of [[Creature|bird]] found in the coast of [[arctic]] [[ocean]]s. They appear individually and are entirely benign, doing little but fly through the air aimlessly. They are one of the smallest animals in the game who aren't outright [[vermin]], making them harmless to all but the most unlucky of [[dwarves]].

Puffins can be captured in [[cage]] [[trap]]s and [[Animal trainer|trained]] into cheap [[pet]]s. [[Ambusher|Hunted]] puffins are too small to be [[butcher]]ed and slaughtered trained ones will only yield a [[skull]], making them useless for a [[meat industry]]. In addition, they only lay a single [[egg]] at a time, making them overall terrible animals for livestock.

Some dwarves [[Preferences|like]] puffins for their ''colorful beaks''.
