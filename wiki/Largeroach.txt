'''Large roaches''' are a type of [[hateable]] above-ground [[vermin]] found in any area that is not [[biome#Freezing|freezing]], can eat stockpiled [[food]], and will cause [[dwarves]] that see them to experience an unhappy [[thought]], so make sure to bring some [[cat]]s to deal with them. All large roaches possess Legendary [[skill]] in [[Climber|climbing]].

Large roaches possess a [[pet]] value of 5, but can't be captured in [[animal trap]]s. Like certain types of real-life roaches, they can fly, and so you may sometimes see them flying through open space.

Some dwarves [[Preferences|like]] large roaches for their ''ability to disgust''.
