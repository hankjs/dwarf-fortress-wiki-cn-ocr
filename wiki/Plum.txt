'''Plum trees''' are one of the many genera of [[tree]]s found above ground. Like the vast majority of above ground trees, plum [[wood]] is brown and produces brown products. Logs can be processed in a [[dyer's shop]] into mauve taupe [[dye]]. Plums can be gathered in a gathering [[zone]], and they can be brewed into [[Alcohol|plum wine]], eaten raw, or cooked.

Some [[Dwarf|dwarves]] [[Preferences|like]] plum trees for their ''fruit''.
