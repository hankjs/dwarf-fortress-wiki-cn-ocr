A '''beak''' is a [[body parts|body part]] that can be generated from killing an animal, but not from [[butcher]]ing. Also, beaks, unlike tails or heads, can not be butchered or used in any way, but may be stored in [[refuse stockpile]]s.

There has been a [[Dwarf_Fortress_Wiki_talk:Improvement_Drive#New_Article.3F|report]] of a beak being claimed for use during a [[strange mood]]; the beak will be treated like regular [[bone]] and be listed as such in the finished [[artifact]].
