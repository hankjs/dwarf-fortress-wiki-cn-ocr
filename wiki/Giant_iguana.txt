'''Giant iguanas''' are the much-larger cousins of the [[iguana]]s who live in all [[savage]] [[tropical]] [[forest]]s. Like their regular counterparts, they are relatively uncommon and only spawn one at a time, but stand 57 times larger than a normal iguana, which makes them far more formidable in combat. However, despite their enlarged bodies, giant iguanas are not predatory and are inclined to leave your [[dwarves]] alone unless you actively attack them, and even then they should stand no chance against a well-equipped [[military]] squad. Unlike their normal cousins, giant iguanas are considered exotic [[mount]]s, so you might see [[Elf|elves]] riding them in the event of a [[siege]].

As normal iguanas already possess a [[pet|pet value]] of 400, the gain from domesticating giant iguanas over normal ones is fairly small and may come down to availability and/or player preference. However, giant iguanas do retain the trait of laying 40 to 50 [[egg]]s at a time, making them excellent targets for [[egg production]], either to feed the fortress or to fulfill the player's fantasies of unleashing an army of 50+ giant spiked reptiles at the unaware [[goblin]] intruders.

Some dwarves like giant iguanas for their ''dewlaps'' and their ''head bobs''.
