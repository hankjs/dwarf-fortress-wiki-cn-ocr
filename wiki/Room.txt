A '''room''' was an area defined from an object that specified the purpose of the room (for example, a [[bedroom]] would be defined from a [[bed]]).

As of v50.01, you instead specify [[activity zone|activity zones]] that may or may not have objects inside them. For the behavior in previous versions, see [[DF2014:Room]].
