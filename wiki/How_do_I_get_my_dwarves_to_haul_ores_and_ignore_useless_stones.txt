What you want to do is create a stone [[stockpile]] that doesn't allow normal stones to be carried to it.

*When you have the stockpile menu open {{k|p}}, select ''Custom stockpile settings'' {{k|t}}.
*Scroll down to Stone and {{k|e}}nable it.
*You will see three categories appear in the middle column, 'Metal Ores', 'Economic stones', and 'Other'.
*Scroll across to the stone categories and {{k|f}}orbid  'Economic stones' and 'Other'.
*Now exit out of the settings menu, and you will be able to place a stockpile that will only store 'Metal Ores'.


===Unique ores===

You can choose to create a stockpile that only stores one kind of ore - for instance, just copper nuggets.
*Forbid 'Metal Ores'.
*Now scroll across to Metal Ore types.
*Now scroll down to 'Copper nuggets' and press {{key|Enter}} - you will notice that both 'Copper nuggets' and 'Metal Ores' becomes a lighter shade of grey. Note you can have more than one type of ore selected if you wish.
*Exit out of the menu and place the stockpile.


===Changing stockpile settings===

You can alter a stockpile's settings at any time by using the examine buildings menu {{k|q}}. Simply hover over it and you will see a number of options come up on the right hand window, including 'stockpile settings' {{k|s}}. This will take you to the same menu as you saw earlier.
