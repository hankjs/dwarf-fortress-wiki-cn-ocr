'''Pike''' are a species of [[Creature|fish]] who can be found at [[temperate]] [[river]]s and [[lake]]s. They are roughly half the size of a [[dwarf]], and provide a fair amount of returns when [[butcher]]ed. As non-[[vermin]] fish, pike can't be fished by [[Fisherdwarf|fisherdwarves]], but can be caught with the use of a [[drowning chamber]]. Infant pike are called ''pike fry''.

Some dwarves [[Preferences|like]] pike for their ''distinct markings''.

Also, do not attempt to arm your army with these, as they have low penetration and are very prone to bending.
