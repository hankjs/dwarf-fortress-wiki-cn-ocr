A '''demand''' is a [[noble]]'s request that your [[dwarf|dwarves]] build a specific item of [[furniture]] in one of their [[zone|room]]s. Most nobles can make demands, and the number they make varies based on how important they are; see [[noble#Needs|here]] for more details. How often they can make demands can be adjusted in the [[Difficulty#Mandates_and_demands|difficulty]] [[settings]].

When a noble makes a demand, you will have about half a year to fulfill it. Demands are always for [[furniture]], and always specify the item (like a [[window]]), the material (like [[green glass]]), and the room it is wanted in (like the [[dining room]]). The example demand will thus read "green glass window in dining room". All three parts must be fulfilled, the correct item from the wrong material or the correct item in the wrong room won't count. Demanded doors and windows can be placed in the walls bordering the room so long as the room's zone extends to cover them.

Demands are announced at the bottom of the screen, but if you miss the message, you can see if a noble is demanding anything on the [[nobles screen|noble's screen]]. If the noble's Demand icon (a chest with an exclamation mark, or {{tile|[D!]|7:0}} in ASCII mode) is gray, they are making no demands. If green, their current demands have been fulfilled or surpassed. If yellow, the noble has stated their demand and has given you time to complete it. If orange or red, the demand is expected to have been completed already.

Fulfilling the demand gives the noble a happy [[thought]]. If a demand goes without being fulfilled, the noble will be "angered at the state of demands" and receive an unhappy thought, but no dwarves will be punished. After about 3 years, an [[announcement]] will be made that the noble has simply "forgotten" the demand.

Demands should not be confused with [[mandate]]s.

== Bugs ==
*Nobles might demand items that cannot be produced (a steel bed for example).{{Bug|944}} At the moment, the only solutions are to hope that one of your dwarves has produced what they want in a strange mood, or (more likely) just deal with the negative thought your noble will receive.
