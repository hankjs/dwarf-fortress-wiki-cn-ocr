'''Mantises''' are a species of unremarkable [[above ground]] [[vermin]] who may be found in any non-freezing [[biome]]. They may not be caught in [[animal trap]]s. All mantises possess Legendary [[skill]] in [[Climber|climbing]].

Some dwarves [[Preferences|like]] mantises for their ''predatory nature'' and their ''grasping legs''.

<!--Reference: "Mantis" bug tracker-->
In earlier versions, mantises were observed hunting [[bug]]s, much like a [[cat]]. This issue is reported [https://dwarffortressbugtracker.com here].
