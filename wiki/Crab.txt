'''Crabs''' are multi-legged [[Creature|critters]] found on [[Ocean|beaches]], usually running away from any threats. [[Butcher]]ing them yields a surprisingly large amount of [[meat]] - despite being described as "tiny", they are actually significantly larger than adult [[cat]]s. All crabs possess Legendary [[skill]] in [[Climber|climbing]] as well as blue-colored [[blood]].

Note that, despite their description, they do not yield a [[shell]] when butchered, they drop "Chitin" instead. Unlike most animals, they cannot be [[animal trainer|trained]]. Also, unlike crabs in real life, they do not lay [[egg]]s and instead give live birth.

Some [[dwarves]] [[Preferences|like]] crabs for their ''pincers'' and their ''sideways walk''.

<!-- Reference: Crab Rave -->
Crabs have been known to gather in droves at beaches and perform a fast-paced swaying dance of some kind, with their claws raised as if celebrating something.
