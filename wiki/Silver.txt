'''Silver''' is a mid-value [[metal]] which is useful for [[weapon]]s, [[ammunition]], [[furniture]],  [[decoration]]s, and other objects. Silver may be combined with other [[metal|metals]] in a [[magma smelter]] or [[smelter]] to produce the following [[metal|alloys]]:

* [[Billon]] = Silver + [[Copper]]
* [[Electrum]] = Silver + [[Gold]]
* [[Black bronze]] = Silver + [[Gold]] + 2× [[Copper]] <sup>†</sup>
* [[Sterling silver]] = 3× Silver + [[Copper]] <sup>†</sup>

<sup>†</sup> these reactions may only be performed with bars (not ores) 

Despite its name, [[nickel silver]] does not contain any silver.

==Properties==
Silver has the highest [[density]] of all the weapon-grade metals; its additional [[weight]] enhances the performance of [[Attack types#Blunt weapons|bludgeon]]ing attacks such as with [[mace]]s, [[Weapon#Foreign weapons|maul]]s, and [[war hammer]]s, though all of the normal metals perform about the same and the extra weight of silver may exhaust the wielder slightly faster.[http://www.bay12forums.com/smf/index.php?topic=181479] Meanwhile, a low shear strength means silver [[edge]]d attacks such as with [[axe]]s, [[spear]]s, or [[sword]]s are quite terrible compared to other metals. Silver also has somewhat poor yield values important for armor, and is more prone to [[wear]].

While silver swords were said to be the only blades capable of slaying [[Werebeast|werewolves]] in legends, werebeast types in ''Dwarf Fortress'' will be vulnerable to a random metal, and [[steel]] will tend to be more reliable.
