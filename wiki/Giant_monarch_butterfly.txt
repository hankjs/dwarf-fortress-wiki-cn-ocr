'''Giant monarch butterflies''' are giant versions of the [[monarch butterfly|monarch butterflies]] - roughly the size of a [[lion]]. Since they are born adults, giant monarch butterflies cannot be fully [[taming|tamed]], though tame versions can be [[Mission#Raids and explorations|procured]] from [[elf|elven]] sites. They do not lay eggs and give live birth instead. They have a measly one-year lifespan, which makes them inappropriate for breeding. They can be [[butcher]]ed for decent returns. Giant monarch butterflies are an [[exotic mount]], and may be seen during elven [[siege]]s.

Some dwarves [[Preferences|like]] giant monarch butterflies for their ''coloration''.
