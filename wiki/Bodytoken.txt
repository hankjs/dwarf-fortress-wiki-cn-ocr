'''Body tokens''' are one of the fundamental parts of creatures, and determine their bodily structure.  There are two major types of body tokens: ''body templates'' (BODY) and ''body parts'' (BP).

A creature uses the {{token|BODY|c}} [[creature token]] to list all of the body templates it includes.  Each part listed in each template is then included in the creature.  In other words: a creature lists the ''body templates'' it is made of, and each ''body template'' contains a set of ''body parts''.  Each ''body part'' specifies which other body part it is attached to.

Body parts can connect specifically to another body part, or generally to any body part of a certain category.  These connections are handled by the CON and CONTYPE body part tokens respectively.

Body parts can be renamed with a [[bodygloss]], allowing someone to reuse an existing template instead of defining a similar template with only the names of the body parts changed.

! Token
! Arguments
! Description

|-
| {{text anchor|BP}}
|
*ID
*name
*pluralized name
| Begin the definition of a body part with the given ID, name, and plural name.  If the plural form would just add an 's' then it can be replaced with 'STP' (which stands for "Standard Plural").

|-
| {{text anchor|APERTURE}}
| 
| Marks the body part as an opening in the body. If it is {{token|EMBEDDED|bo}}, it cannot be gouged.

|-
| {{text anchor|BREATHE}}
| 
| Body part is used to breathe. If all body parts with [BREATHE] are damaged or destroyed, the creature will suffocate unless it has the {{token|NOBREATHE|c}} tag. Note that bruising counts as (fast-healing) damage.

|-
| {{text anchor|CATEGORY}}
| 
*ID
| Assigns the body part to a user-defined category. Used by {{token|CON_CAT|bo}} to attach to other body parts.

|-
| {{text anchor|CON}}
| 
*value
| Connects the body part to a specific other body part.

|-
| {{text anchor|CON_CAT}}
| 
*value
| Connects the body part to all other body parts having the specified {{token|CATEGORY|bo}}.

|-
| {{text anchor|CONTYPE}}
| 
*value
| Connects the body part to all other body parts having the specified type token. Valid values are [[body_token#UPPERBODY|UPPERBODY]], [[body_token#LOWERBODY|LOWERBODY]], [[body_token#HEAD|HEAD]], [[body_token#GRASP|GRASP]], or [[body_token#STANCE|STANCE]].

|-
| {{text anchor|CIRCULATION}}
| 
| Body part is responsible for blood circulation. Exact effects not known.

|-
| {{text anchor|CONNECTOR}}
| 
| Body part is used to connect other body parts together. Used for the neck and lower spine.

|-
| {{text anchor|DEFAULT_RELSIZE}}
| 
*Size
| This command establishes the relative size of body parts within a creature. The numbers have no absolute meaning or units.

|-
| {{text anchor|DIGIT}}
| 
| Defines part as a digit. Body parts that are digits, or have them as direct sub-parts, can perform gouging attacks within a wrestling hold.

|-
| {{text anchor|EMBEDDED}}
| 
| Body part with this tag is embedded on the surface of parent body part. i.e.: eyes and mouth on head. It cannot be chopped off, can't be used to wrestle enemies and can't be grabbed by them.

|-
| {{text anchor|FLIER}}
| 
| Flags the body part as being needed for flight.  Damage to a certain number of FLIER body parts will prevent the creature from flying.  Note that a creature can only fly if the creature has the {{token|FLIER|c}} tag in its creature definition, and that a flying creature does not actually need any FLIER body parts.  This tag's only purpose is to identify body parts which will cause a creature to '''lose''' the ability to fly when damaged.

|-
| {{text anchor|GELDABLE}}
| 
| Creatures with a body part containing this token may be [[gelder|gelded]], creating a sterile creature that is typically marked with {{DFtext|x{{char|11}}x}}. Gelding may also occur during combat if this body part is damaged sufficiently.
Despite its name, GELDABLE does not need to be combined with [[Creature token#MALE|MALE]]. A modded [[Creature token#FEMALE|FEMALE]] creature with a GELDABLE body part can be "gelded" through the regular gelding interface or through combat damage, resulting in a sterile creature marked {{DFtext|x{{char|12}}x}}.

|-
| {{text anchor|GRASP}}
| 
| Creature can wield a picked-up weapon with the body part, and can use the part to initiate almost all wrestling moves. When creatures are spawned with a weapon and shield, one GRASP part will hold a weapon while '''all others''' will hold shields. A grasp-able bodypart is needed for Grasp-attacks, which are in turn needed to start a fist fight. Creatures throwing a tantrum, but missing a bodypart with the grasp-property, will be cancelling their fist fight, due to being 'too injured'.

|-
| {{text anchor|GUTS}}
| 
| Body part is susceptible to low blows. Used for guts. Damage to this body part causes nausea and may make the creature lose turns, vomiting uncontrollably.

|-
| {{text anchor|HEAD}}
| 
| Flags the body part as being able to wear head clothing like hats, helms, etc. If all heads are chopped off, the creature dies. Multiple heads '''are''' redundant - for example, [[hydra]]s can survive with several missing heads.

|-
| {{text anchor|HEAR}}
| 
| Body part is used to hear. May be a requirement for the body part to wear earrings.

|-
| {{text anchor|INDIVIDUAL_NAME}}
| 
*name
*plural
| Adding individual names tells the game what to call each individual part in a [[body_token#NUMBER|NUMBER]]ed bodypart.  This command replaces "first upper front tooth" for example.

|-
| {{text anchor|INTERNAL}}
|
| Marks the body part as being inside the body. It is behind all the other tissues of the body part, cannot be severed, nor used for wrestling. It cannot be targeted directly in combat, but can be damaged by attacks to the parent body part.

|-
| {{text anchor|JOINT}}
| 
| Body part is a joint. If the limb it's in is grabbed in a wrestling hold, it can be broken with bending force, disabling the parent limb. If the joint is modded to sit outside the body, grabbing and breaking it snaps the entire limb right off.

|-
| {{text anchor|LIMB}}
| 
| Body part is a limb.  It can be used to initiate most wrestling moves. If it is located between an {{token|UPPERBODY|bo}} part and a {{token|GRASP|bo}} body part, it is eligible to be covered by certain types of armor (body armors and gauntlets). If it is located between a {{token|LOWERBODY|bo}} part and a {{token|STANCE|bo}} body part, it is eligible to be covered by other types of armor (Leg armors like pants, etc.; trailing body armors like mail shirts and robes; and high boots).

|-
| {{text anchor|LOWERBODY}}
| 
| Flags the body part as being able to wear lower body clothing like skirts, pants, etc.  If all parts with this token are chopped off or pulped, the creature dies. If the creature has multiple parts with this token, they will not die until all parts with this token have been pulped or severed. No such creature exists in the base game, however.

|-
| {{text anchor|LEFT}}
| 
| Marks body part as on the left side of the body and vulnerable to attacks from the left. Used in conjunction with tags in the b_detail_plan_default raw.

|-
| {{text anchor|MOUTH}}
| 
| Body part is a mouth. Implication unknown.

|-
| {{text anchor|NUMBER}}
| 
*value
| The number lets you stack identical body parts.  These can be individually damaged by wounds, but you don't have to define them explicitly one by one.  If you don't give them individual names (see teeth) they'll be preceded by ordinal numbers (first, second, etc.). In practice, though, they cannot be individually damaged - if you knock out one tooth, the entire group will be knocked out at once (and will be scattered across the area). Butchering doesn't respect this and produces only a single body part per group. The value is capped at 32.

|-
| {{text anchor|NERVOUS}}
| 
| Body part is the hub of nervous function. Used for the parts of the spine. Damage disables everything in the parent bodypart and what's below it, causing death by suffocation in most cases.

|-
| {{text anchor|PREVENTS_PARENT_COLLAPSE}}
| 
| Body part must be destroyed in order for the attached parent object to be considered destroyed. Found on skulls and spinal columns. 

|-
| {{text anchor|RIGHT}}
| 
| Marks body part as on the right side of the body and vulnerable to attacks from the right. Used in conjunction with tags in the b_detail_plan_default raw.

|-
| {{text anchor|SKELETON}}
| 
| Body part is part of the creature's skeleton.

|-
| {{text anchor|STANCE}}
| 
| Allows the creature to stand. Damage or loss of these body parts will cause the creature to fall over - loss of one STANCE part can be substituted with a crutch. Does not give the body part an ability to initiate wrestling moves, unlike {{token|GRASP|bo}} or {{token|LIMB|bo}}.

|-
| {{text anchor|SIGHT}}
| 
| Body part is used to see.  If the creature has no SIGHT body parts, or if all its sight body parts are damaged or destroyed, it can't see unless it has the {{token|EXTRAVISION|c}} tag in its creature definition.

|-
| {{text anchor|SMELL}}
| 
| Body part is used to smell. Currently unused.

|-
| {{text anchor|SMALL}}
| 
| "SMALL means that the part isn't displayed as part of the overall displayed body part lists, and can't be splinted.  They are more often targeted for torture (although those situations might not occur anymore).  They are removed in skeletons if they aren't specifically skeletons/joints/digits/apertures.  They are more easily lost in world gen duels.  They are the only gougable/pinchable parts ''(note: at least this is no longer the case.)''. SMALL is an old tag, so it has accumulated some weird functions which'll get split off over time. " --Toady

|-
| {{text anchor|SOCKET}}
| 
| Body part breaks off and goes flying if broken, even with blunt force. Used on teeth to make them easy to knock out - rendered invalid by {{token|INTERNAL|bo}}.

|-
| {{text anchor|THROAT}}
| 
| Body part can be strangled - latching bites that hit the head have a chance to target this instead. Note: this tag doesn't control any bleeding behavior.

|-
| {{text anchor|THOUGHT}}
| 
| The central core of the body, used with the brain. Damage causes instant death, unless the creature has {{token|NO_THOUGHT_CENTER_FOR_MOVEMENT|c}}/{{token|NOTHOUGHT|c}}.{{verify}}

If no body part has this token (and none of the above exclusions are specified), the creature will spawn injured and will be unable to stand or fly. If the creature is a {{token|FLIER|c}}, this can result in it spawning in mid-air, immediately plummeting to the ground, and dying of fall damage.

|-
| {{text anchor|TOTEMABLE}}
| 
| This bodypart can be turned into a totem by craftsmen. Always drops from slaughtered creatures, no matter how small.

|-
| {{text anchor|UPPERBODY}}
| 
| Flags the body part as being able to wear upper body clothing like coats, breastplates etc.  If all parts with this token are pulped or chopped off, the creature dies. Multiple UPPERBODY parts are redundant, but no such creatures exist in the base game. All default creatures with bodies have the upper body as the root of the body tree, making it impossible to chop off.

|-
| {{text anchor|UNDER_PRESSURE}}
| 
| Makes the body part pop out of the body when cut through - used on guts. Body part shows up as "~" and drags behind the victim when spilled.

|-
| {{text anchor|VERMIN_BUTCHER_ITEM}}
| 
| Allows the item to be obtained from butchered or rotted vermin - used with [[shell]]s.

==Example==
The following example creates an arrangement of spike parts that emerge from spike bases arranged along the upper and lower back. The parts are attached together in a flexible way that allows the creature definition to choose how many spikes bases are arranged on the body, how thick the spike bases are, and how many spikes emerge from each individual base.

{{code|defines spikes that are intended to looking something like this:
      /\          <-SPIKE
