'''Pileated gibbons''' are a very rare species of [[Creature|gibbon]] found exclusively in [[tropical]] moist broadleaf [[forest]]s, where they always appear in pairs. Marginally heavier than the average [[cat]], these apes are little more than a distraction for a passing [[dwarf]], being benign and overall harmless. All pileated gibbons are born with Legendary [[skill]] in [[Climber|climbing]].

Pileated gibbons can be captured in [[cage]] [[trap]]s and [[Animal trainer|trained]] into valuable exotic [[pet]]s. Due to their rarity and small size, they make poor targets for a [[meat industry]]. Pileated gibbons take 8 years to reach adulthood, but reach their maximum size by the age of 2.

Some dwarves [[Preferences|like]] pileated gibbons for their ''white head rings'' and their ''ability to swing through the trees''.
