'''Ostrich men''' are [[animal people]] variants of the common [[ostrich]] who inhabit [[savage]] [[desert]]s and some [[tropical]] grasslands. They spawn in groups of anywhere between 5-10 individuals and are generally content to keep to themselves. In terms of size, they are a little bigger than the average [[human]]. Like standard ostriches, the sprite for male ostrich men will have black feathers, with ostrich women having greyish-brown feathers.

Like other savage animal people, ostrich men can join [[civilization]]s, become [[historical figure]]s, appear as [[visitor]]s and be playable in [[adventurer mode]].

Some dwarves [[Preferences|like]] ostrich men for their ''long necks'' and their ''giant eggs''.
