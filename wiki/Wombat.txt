'''Wombats''' are solitary [[Creature|animals]] found in [[temperate]] [[forest]]s, [[shrubland]]s and [[mountain]]s. Slightly smaller than the average [[dog]], they're benign and do little but wander through your surroundings aimlessly, serving as easy prey for a [[dwarf]] or any other larger creature who decides to take a bite out of them. Infant wombats are called ''joeys''.

Wombats can be captured in [[cage]] [[trap]]s and [[Animal trainer|trained]] into exotic [[pet]]s. They give a decent amount of returns when [[butcher]]ed, but as they appear one at a time, reliably hunting or capturing them for breeding purposes can be difficult.

Some dwarves [[Preferences|like]] wombats for their ''waddle''.
