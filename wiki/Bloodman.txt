'''Blood men''' are exceptionally rare, [[evil]]-aligned [[construct creature]]s composed of [[blood]] found only in the third [[cavern]] layer. They stand the height of a [[human]], feel no emotion or [[No Exert|exertion]], are [[No Pain|immune to pain]] and [[No Stun|cannot be stunned]]. While this sounds terrifying on paper, being made out of a liquid means you're going to lose limbs very easily. They are among the weakest, most harmless creatures you will encounter in the caverns, as even civilian [[dwarf|dwarves]] and [[children]] can quickly punch their limbs off. Additionally, their punches are soft enough to not do real damage to even naked dwarves.

When they die, they leave a tile of "corrupted blood", but there's nothing dangerous about it, and it doesn't carry any sort of [[syndrome]]. Despite being made of a liquid, dunking blood men in water won't cause them to fall apart. Blood men are biologically immortal and only die from violence. They can't be spawned in the [[object testing arena]].

Some dwarves [[Preferences|like]] blood men for their ''gruesomeness''.
