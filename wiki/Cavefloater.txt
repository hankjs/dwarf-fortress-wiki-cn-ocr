'''Cave floaters''' are small floating [[creature]]s full of [[syndrome|noxious]] gas, rarely found in groups of 1-3 individuals in the deepest [[cavern]]s. The good news is that [[Syndrome#SYN_INHALED|inhaling]] the gas won't kill your [[Dwarf|dwarves]], though it may knock them unconscious. The bad news is that it's nearly impossible to avoid contamination, since it's an inhaled projectile weapon. It isn't typically necessary to fight these creatures, but if you must, you'll want to shoot them from afar.

Cave floaters cannot attack normally, except for their default [[push]] attack - instead, they launch a stream of steaming cave floater gas juice at attackers. This juice, despite being described as hot, doesn't seem to cause burns or indeed do much of anything. If you manage to kill a cave floater without puncturing it, take care '''not''' to [[butcher]] the corpse, as it will detonate the gas right there in the butcher's shop. It's not generally worth it anyway, as the only thing produced will be a single cave floater [[skin]] (which will turn into '''more''' poisonous gas the instant you attempt to tan it{{bug|1448}}).

If a cave floater is exposed to [[temperature]]s below 10000 °U (0 °C), such as by luring it out onto a [[glacier]], it will die as a result of condensation. ''(This is because cave floater gas, which constitutes the <code>[[Tissue_definition_token#FUNCTIONAL|[FUNCTIONAL]]]</code> tissue material of its <code>[[Body_token#THOUGHT|[THOUGHT]]]</code> body part, condenses at this temperature).''

Cave floaters possess a [[pet]] value of 50, but lack the necessary tokens to be [[Animal trainer|trainable]]. Additionally, they may not be spawned in the [[object testing arena]].

Some dwarves [[Preferences|like]] cave floaters for their ''graceful drifting''.
