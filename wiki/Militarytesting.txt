=== Dwarves against Skeletal Horses (tested by: plynxis) ===

<u>'''Times run:'''</u> 2

<sup>1</sup>Refers only to those injured.

<u>'''Notes:'''</u>
I did this test to see if dwarves can survive horses if they've got full iron armor and weapons. The fight was short and it looks like the skeletal horses charge hard and if they hit, they stun and can kill pretty fast if they're not stopped. I tried it 6:3 because I didn't expect the dwarves to survive a 1:1 ratio against the horses anyway. And yes the amount of trials is pathetic :P

<u>'''Tester's conclusion:'''</u>
Even if dwarves are fully equipped, skeletal horses are very hard to deal with without casualties or at least serious injuries. Going up to a herd requires at least double the dwarves (if they're unskilled at least) to make sure you'll win and even then you're very likely to end up with dwarves that need hospitalization.

<u>'''Notes:'''</u>
The purpose of this test was to see how shields block fire. In that sense, it was a failure since none of the imps even had the time to attempt fire attacks. The dwarves use their shields as weapons when they don't have an actual weapon in hand and can use it to block at the same time.

<u>'''Tester's conclusion:'''</u>
Dwarves with shields and the skill to use them can be very deadly and hard to kill as well. That and fire imps are easy to kill :P

=== Dwarves against Dragon (tested by: plynxis) ===

<u>'''Times run:'''</u> 1

<u>'''Notes:'''</u>
This is a test intended to test fire blocking with shields, in lieu of the previous test which failed at it. Dwarves can block fire breath fine with iron shields and the shields do not get worn.

<u>'''Tester's conclusion:'''</u>
Again, dwarves capable of using shields properly are very hard to kill. These ones had very high skill and the only way the dragon was able to kill them was by knocking them over or stunning them and following through with a bite, severing them in half.

<u>'''Times run:'''</u> 1

<u>'''Notes:'''</u>
This test was made to test the effectiveness of non-firesafe material shields against fire. Other than that, the setup is entirely identical to the previous test.

<u>'''Tester's conclusion:'''</u>
Shield material does not matter when used by a dwarf it seems and it also never gets worn, so technically a shield of any material is just as adequate for defense. The dwarves again used their shields to attack successfully. Fights with dragons also seem to always include the dragon getting all his toes broken and often his nose. It is also apparent that chance is an important factor when attacks that land by one side (the dragon in this case) are almost always fatal and the other side (the dwarves here) is capable of completely blocking the majority of these attacks. This demonstrated by the fact that in the previous test all dwarves died while in this one the dragon died instead, with all survivors being intact.

<u>'''Notes:'''</u>
This is a followup of the previous test to examine how effective shields are against skeletal horses.

<u>'''Tester's conclusion:'''</u>
The dwarves are not only capable of killing the horses, but also prevent any injury to themselves. The horses still push them around a bit, but there is little they can do when dwarves gang up on them. The fight is also, quite short.

<u>'''Notes:'''</u>
This was done by accident, but serves as a comparison between Skeletal and regular Horses. There seems to be no comparison :P. The intent was to test how capable dwarves are with just a "Skilled" level of expertise with shields rather than Grand Master.

<u>'''Tester's conclusion:'''</u>
Contrary to Skeletal Horses, the regular ones are much harder to kill with shields. The important point here however is the immense difference of capability a dwarf has at a low skill level contrary to a high skill level. Dwarves at this level do not have a consistent ability to block attacks and use their shields enough to prevent quick death, especially by horses.

<u>'''Notes:'''</u>
This is intended to test the actual effectiveness of dwarves as grand masters against regular horses, so as to compare to skeletal horses and the previous test that had dwarves using shields at a lower skill level.

<u>'''Tester's conclusion:'''</u>
Arguably, a higher skill level is a lot more effective, but horses still are very hard to kill without casualties. The difference between fighting a bones-only Horse and an actual muscled Horse is very apparent.

=== Dwarves against Hydra (tested by: plynxis) ===

<u>'''Notes:'''</u>
This test was not completed, but the eventual outcome is fairly obvious. It was begun right after the previous one in order to compare how a stronger monster would fare against grand master shieldwarves.

<u>'''Tester's conclusion:'''</u>
Like the dragon, the hydra has a very hard time with the dwarves. The fight is long and even though it can kill them all eventually, the damage it takes in the meantime is definitive. A slightly higher number of dwarves might have killed it and even if a whole squad dies, the threat the hydra poses is practically eliminated as it will probably eventually die on its own anyway.


=== Bronze vs. Iron ===

To simulate Fortress mode, 8 battles of 8 vs. 8. Since goblins only use iron, both teams wore iron armour, only difference between the teams being iron vs. bronze short sword.

<u>'''Times run: 8'''</u> 

<u>'''Initial setup:'''</u>
{| class="wikitable sortable"|-
! Side & Creature !! Number !! Skills !! Items|-| #1: Dwarf || 8 || Proficient Swordsdwarf || Full iron set minus breastplate and shield, iron short sword|-| #2: Dwarf || 8 || Proficient Swordsdwarf || Full iron set minus breastplate and shield, bronze short sword|}

<u>'''Results:'''</u>
{| class="wikitable sortable"|-
! Side & Creature !! Survived !! Injury level !! Health tags !! Most common cause of death|-| #1: Iron team || 4 lost rounds, 20 of 14 wounded || Severed limbs<br>cuts || Tired<br>Pale<br>Faint || Bleeding|-| #2: Bronze team || 4 lost rounds, 24 of 21 wounded || Severed limbs<br>cuts || Tired<br>Pale<br>Faint || Bleeding|}

<u>'''Tester's conclusion:'''</u>
Casualty/wounded(bruises and missing tooth/broken noses etc not counting)/intact rates of 67/30/3% for bronze and vs. 72/19/8% for iron would suggest that while bronze might be better in bigger and longer fights, as in all but 1 of the battles the first casualty was for the bronze team. This is probably because all attacks, both edged attacks and both blunt attacks the short sword has were seen to be used and because good part of the attacks that hit armour were deflected(and effectively became blunt attacks), and because bronze as a heavier material works slightly better in blunting, while the iron seems to have a slight edge in edged attacks. This is also supported by the comparably much higher amount of wounded dwarves(presumably having been hit early in the battle, lots of missing feet, at times lower legs, hands, lower arms, ears and noses) in the bronze team, despite them losing less as KIA.

A 52 vs 52 fight was also tested to see how much difference there would be when majority of the kills would be made when dwarves would be tired and suffering from broken bones(presumably the iron team more than bronze), and bronze team slightly more from cuts and missing body parts. The bronze team annihilated the iron team, having only 50% losses. Of its 26 survivors, however, 25(!) were wounded. Only one dwarf remained intact without cuts or body parts missing.

=== Adamantine Axes vs. Silver Hammers (no armor) ===

<u>'''Times run: 10'''</u> 

<u>'''Initial setup:'''</u>
{| class="wikitable sortable"|-
! Side & Creature !! Number !! Skills !! Items|-| #1: Dwarf || 10 || Grandmaster All Skills ||   Only silver war hammer|-| #2: Dwarf || 10 || Grandmaster All Skills ||   Only adamantine battleaxe|}

<u>'''Results:'''</u>
{| class="wikitable sortable"|-
! Side & Creature !! Wins|-| #1: Hammer team || Won 5 of 10 rounds|-| #2: Axe team || Won 5 of 10 rounds|}

This study seems to show that (for legendary dwarves), silver war hammers are about equal with adamantine battleaxes, even with both sides being unarmored. The previous time I ran this test, hammers actually won 6 of the 10 rounds, but this time it was evenly split.

:(Is that because a grandmaster dwarf can disable or kill an unarmored dwarf with just one hit with either weapon?  Might be worth examining the combat logs.) [[User:Bognor|Bognor]] 09:08, 3 June 2011 (UTC)

<u>'''Notes:'''</u>
I want to figure out how good the different blunt weapons are in relation to each other. For now I will test with silver only. 
I placed them in two groups on different z-levels with 6 from each side in each group. Each side was ordered in lines (parallel to the y axis) with no space between the individuals. The lines from each side was place right next to each other in each group. Group one had the 6 macemen on left (on the x axis) and the 6 hammermen on the right. Group two had mace on the right and hammer on left.     

<u>'''Tester's conclusion:'''</u>

Leaves little doubt that in case of naked men fighting each other with warhammers and maces the hammers win. The hammerman who lost consciousness fought several macemen before fainting.

The one time that the crossow killed the battle axe was infact not with a crossow. The battle axe stuck the hand, disarming the crossbow. The disarmed dwarf proceded to knock out the battle axe dwarf, and smash his skull in with his foot.

So I've been wanting to test the common knowledge that more armor layering = better, so this is the test I set up. Both sides were identical, except that one team wore three mail shirts rather than one. Using steel as the rest of the armor and iron axes ensured that everything important happened around the iron armor. 
The battle was slow, almost every hit being stopped by armor. Over time, team one's thinner armor let more blows through, and they eventually bled out or suffocated from lung damage.
This test proved that wearing more armor increases protection. However...

<u>'''Times run:'''</u> 2

<u>'''Initial setup:'''</u>
{| class="wikitable sortable"|-
! Side & Creature !! Number !! Skills !! Items|-| #1: Dwarves || 12 || None || Steel gauntlets/greaves/high boots/helm, iron battle axe, 1 iron mail shirt|-| #2: Dwarves || 12 || None || Steel gauntlets/greaves/high boots/helm, iron battle axe, 3 iron mail shirts|}

This test was very similar to the last, except that the skill of armor user was set to zero. And that reversed the results. While team two was more protected, they were also considerably slower (606 v. 788) and I think they were also quicker to over-exert and pass out. 

Overall results: The added armor is only useful at higher levels of training. I didn't calibrate enough to find the actual midpoint, but it seems that the added layers drop off in efficiency and are not as useful, potentially being harmful if the user is unable to handle the weight.

This is a test to determine what would be the best material for shields. Tested with 22 independent dwarves at different places of the arena, it was a long battle and in the end one of the winner dwarves found his way to a still fighting couple, hence total 12 alive dwarves at the end.

Aside from that test I made a couple more with the same idea and always dwarves with heavier shields won only if they bashed opponents with these shields, f.e. if they've lost their weapons.

So at the end the only important parameter for a shield is its weight.

<u>'''Notes:'''</u> In the first round, speardwarf got his weapon stuck several times. Axedwarf attacked later, and only twice, missing both times. Speardwarf devastated axedwarf in this round. In the second round, axedwarf charges and topples speardwarf initially, then severs several limbs. Speardwarf landed only one bruising hit. Both made many misses. Axedwarf devastated speardwarf in this round. The victor barely got injured at all in both rounds, and the loser gets mutilated. Because of these polarising results, two rounds were deemed sufficient.

In conclusion, both axes and spears are edged weapons that give a great advantage when making initial lucky strikes/hits against lesser-material armored oponents. The difference seems to be in the types of wounds: Fractured bones and open arteries for spears, and severed limbs for battle axes.

<u>'''Notes:'''</u> Lots of misses again, but relatively less. Though the first fight was concluded with speardwarves ganging up on the surviving axedwarves, in each individual fight from the start, speardwarves dominated. In the second fight, the surviving axedwarf was moderately injured to two limbs. Each individual fight was dominated by one side. Speardwarf kills were faster.

Though again polarizing, these results do show that axes and spears are approximately equally good, albeit only when used for the proper targets. If it is organic and is not clad in adamantine (as according to the previous test), spears will kill it faster. If it is not, and has many limbs, then an axe is superior. This makes spears better for regular use, and axes better against BC's and HFS. For a general-purpose weapon, an axe is therefore the best choice, though it may be worth it to specialize.

<u>'''Notes:'''</u>
In both tests, all 5 swordsdwarves were killed by a single axedwarf after he lost his weapon arm and began favoring shield bashing attacks. No axe attacks appeared to have caused major injury.

<u>'''Tester's conclusion:'''</u>
This test was intended to compare the effectiveness of swords and axes against armored targets. It shows fairly conclusively that the battle axe is the inferior weapon against armored targets, and that even if already injured a dwarf using iron shield bashes can still prove extremely deadly against enemies using weapons that cannot reliably penetrate their armor.

<u>'''Tester's conclusion:'''</u>
This test was intended to compare the effectiveness of swords and axes against weakly-armored armored targets. It shows somewhat conclusively that the battle axe is the inferior weapon against such targets targets, but that the disadvantage can be overcome with luck.

=== War Hammer material effectiveness comparison (ongoing) (Tested by: Adonkares) ===
<u>'''Test description:'''</u> After editing the object testing arena into 896 4x1 duel rooms and 84 5x5 5v5 brawl rooms the premise of gold war hammer superiority was put to trial using a variety of different hammer materials. A program was written to populate the arena more quickly as well as equip the dwarves. (If anyone has any tips on counting the results quickly or via a program, please let me know.)

<u>'''Acronym explanation:'''</u> Each test was assigned a number from 1-3. Each row in a table is named after Duel or Group results and is followed by a -s -g -c suffix to denote the material of the weapon equipped. And so 1solo-g means a group of 1v1 dwarf fighters with steel armor and gold hammers.

<u>'''Information:'''</u>
{| class="wikitable sortable"|-
! Creature !! Number !! Skills !! Items |-| 1solo-s: Dwarf || 1 || Master in Fighter, Hammer, Dodge, Shield and Armor user || Full set of steel armor plus a steel shield, with a silver war hammer|-| 1solo-g: Dwarf || 1 || Master in Fighter, Hammer, Dodge, Shield and Armor user || Full set of steel armor plus a steel shield, with a gold war hammer|-| 1group-s: Dwarf || 5 || Master in Fighter, Hammer, Dodge, Shield and Armor user || Full set of steel armor plus a steel shield, with a silver war hammer|-| 1group-g: Dwarf || 5 || Master in Fighter, Hammer, Dodge, Shield and Armor user || Full set of steel armor plus a steel shield, with a gold war hammer|-| 2solo-s: Dwarf || 1 || Master in Fighter, Hammer, Dodge, Shield and Armor user || Unarmored, with a silver war hammer|-| 2solo-c: Dwarf || 1 || Master in Fighter, Hammer, Dodge, Shield and Armor user || Unarmored, with a copper war hammer|-| 2group-s: Dwarf || 5 || Master in Fighter, Hammer, Dodge, Shield and Armor user || Unarmored, with a silver war hammer|-| 2group-c: Dwarf || 5 || Master in Fighter, Hammer, Dodge, Shield and Armor user || Unarmored, with a copper war hammer|-| 3solo-s: Dwarf || 1 || Master in Fighter, Hammer, Dodge, Shield and Armor user || Full iron, with a silver war hammer|-| 3solo-c: Dwarf || 1 || Master in Fighter, Hammer, Dodge, Shield and Armor user || Full iron, with a copper war hammer|-| 3group-s: Dwarf || 5 || Master in Fighter, Hammer, Dodge, Shield and Armor user || Full iron, with a silver war hammer|-| 3group-c: Dwarf || 5 || Master in Fighter, Hammer, Dodge, Shield and Armor user || Full iron, with a copper war hammer|}

<u>'''Results:'''</u>
{| class="wikitable sortable"|-
! Winners !! Win percentage !! Sample size !! Comments |-| 1solo-g: Duelists using Gold War Hammer || 56.47% || 1792 || Slight but consistent edge (more adequately flat) for gold hammers, it is reasonable to estimate gold's superiority over silver to be within 3-8% range.|-| 1group-g: Team of 5 using Gold War Hammer || 55.3% || 168 || Borderline standard error, more tests are needed. Duel results suggest a slight advantage for gold hammers.|-| 2solo-s: Duelists using Silver War Hammer || 53.57% || 1792 || Slight advantage for silver hammers, sample size too small and falls within standard error. For practical intents and purposes copper is equal to silver when used against unarmored opponents.|-| 2group-s: Team of 5 using Silver War Hammer || 59.5% || 168 || Sample size too small, more tests are needed. Duel results suggest no noticeable advantage for either material.|-| 3solo-s: Duelists using Silver War Hammer || 53.01% || 896 || Slight advantage for silver hammers, sample size too small and falls within standard error. For practical intents and purposes copper is equal to silver when used against ironclad opponents.|-| 3group-s: Team of 5 using Silver War Hammer || 56.5% || 84 || Sample size too small, more tests are needed. Duel results suggest no noticeable advantage for either material.|}
<u>'''Results:'''</u> Based on the above 3 tests there's a slight ~5-6% advantage of gold war hammers over silver and by extension copper ones. There is no significant advantage of silver over copper against unarmored and ironclad opponents and whatever advantage there might be it falls within mean error range and requires a bigger sample size. I hope someone found this useful, I sure did when I was doing the tests out of curiosity. In the future I'm planning to include platinum hammers, adamantine armors and increasing the sample size of all tests.


=== Scourge versus Whip (Tested By Admiral Obvious) ===

<u>'''Test description:'''</u> Fiddling around in the arena after installing DF on a public PC which is wiped daily. Attempting to determine which weapon is more effective, and why. Unarmored targets were used for this test. A separate test set will/should be make with armored specimens.

<u>'''Times run:'''</u> 10

<u>'''Initial setup:'''</u> Single unskilled human, versus unskilled human, given weapons. Test saved prior to start, and restarted after each result.
{| class="wikitable sortable"|-
! Side & Creature !! Number !! Skills !! Items|-| #1: Human Male|| 1 || -no skills- || Iron Whip, no armor|-| #2: Human Male || 1 || -no skills- || Iron Scourge, no armor|}

{| class="wikitable sortable"|-
! Side & Creature !! Survived !! Injury level !! Health tags !! Most common cause of death|-| #1: Human Male || 1 || Chipped Bones || Tired, Extreme Pain || Passing out from broken limb, followed up by head cave in.|-| #2: Human Male || 9 || None || Tired || Upper spine shattered in the one instance of death, suffocation.|}
<u>'''Results:'''</u> From what testing that was performed, it seemed that the whip was an easy weapon to parry compared to the scourge. This might be in relation to the weapon velocity modifier, or potentially attack preparation time. It was noticed in this test that the scourge user attempted more successful attacks than the whip user. The scourge rarely "one shot" the enemy, however it did chip bones regularly against an unarmored target. The whip on the other hand, when it landed it's shots were far more devastating to the target than otherwise. Further testing will be done with different materials.

== Adamantine: Test: 2 ==


<u>'''Times run:'''</u> 10

<u>'''Initial setup:'''</u> Single unskilled human, versus unskilled human, given weapons. Test saved prior to start, and restarted after each result.
{| class="wikitable sortable"|-

Bleeds to death on every test.|-| #2: Human Male || 10 || Bruising, occasional broken fingers and toes. || Tired, Pain || Reset of the universe.|}
<u>'''Results:'''</u> Adamantine is far too light for a whip to have any noticeable impact against the target, only causing minor bruising, and the occasional shattering of a finger or toe. The Scourge on the other hand, being an edged attack weapon seemed to be like the death of a thousand paper cuts. The scourge rarely inflicted any damage to the bones of the target, but every single successful impact against the target cut into the muscle of the target, and in many cases severed motor, and sensory nerves. Getting killed in this way appeared to be torture, especially considering how long it took to run each one of these tests.

== Platinum: Test: 3 ==

<u>'''Times run:'''</u> 10

<u>'''Initial setup:'''</u> Single unskilled human, versus unskilled human, given weapons. Test saved prior to start, and restarted after each result.

One other death was caused by ribs puncturing the heart causing a bleedout.|}

<u>'''Results:'''</u> This was a far fairer fight, I assume if I run the test more, the results would average out to be nearly equal. Whip impacts are absolutely devastating, in many instances involving the total collapse of the impacted area. The Scourge is also equally dangerous, but with much less one shot potential, and a quite high tendency to chip, and break bones. The Scourge is inferior in this case compared to the whip, but this is made up with an apparent higher attack frequency.

== Unarmored Peasant Best Weapon Test (Tested by: RoyalAssassin3) ==
<u>'''Test description:'''</u> My goal in this series of test is to identify the “best” natively producible weapons for random unskilled unarmored peasants.  This might be used to stockpile the “best” weapons around the base that can be grabbed in an emergency situation where enemies have breached the fortress and you need to start conscripting everyone to grab something and fight.  
I did not test maces because previous tests (by hostergaard) have established that maces are in all respects worse versions of war hammers.  I also did not test crossbows because they require more finesse to be effective, in close range cells, like my testing environment (or a goblin breach of the main fortress), they are pretty much just glorified clubs.  I used iron weapons to simulate the best goblins.
After a few slow and tedious tests, I created a modified arena with 20 adjacent 5x12 dueling cells (enough space to dodge and maneuver) with the combatants starting 4 paces apart.    Injury Level, Health tags, and Cause of death data were too tedious to tabulate on this scale and so have been excluded.

<u>'''Results:'''</u> As expected, a shield gave sword the edge.

=== Pick & Shield v. Sword & Shield ===
<u>'''Test description:'''</u> This test is to see whether X + shield combos follow the same pattern of effectiveness as weapons alone.  If so, the win percentage of pick & shield vs. sword & shield should match with the previous pick v. spear test (assuming swords and spears are equivalent).

{| class="wikitable sortable"|-
! Side & Creature !! Wins (ties) !! Percentage Win (ties) |-| #1: Pick & Shield Dwarf || 12 wins (0 ties) || 60% (0% ties)|-| #2: Sword & Shield Dwarf || 8 wins (0 ties) || 40% (0% ties) |}
<u>'''Results:'''</u> Pick & Shield wins.  The 60% win rate for Pick & Shield exactly matches the win rate of Pick in the Pick v. Spear test.  This validates two premises. (1) X + shield vs. Y + shield = X vs. Y;  and (2) Spear = Sword for unarmored unskilled opponents.  The first premise is consistent with a shield giving a fixed percentage chance of deflection irrespective of weapon type.

<u>'''Overall Tester Conclusions for Peasant Weapon Testing:'''</u> Pick & Shield > Pick & Sword > Pick >> Spear = Sword > Battleaxe >> Hammer > Unarmed.  Pick & Shield was the surprise best.  

It is worth noting that according to the weapon article a significant percentage of dwarves are not big enough to wield both a pick and a shield.  In the testing arena, none of the pick & shield dwarves dropped their picks or shields which suggests either (1) the arena uses different rules; (2) size affects whether dwarves will pick up a pick and shield, but once they have it in their hands they don’t drop it; or (3) size and wielding limitations has changed since the weapons article was updated.  I suspect (2) is the answer, but further testing is needed.  Sword and shield might be more reliable.

Despite the superiority of shields, I would probably recommend using only picks (not picks and shields or swords and shields) as an emergency defense fallback.  This spares dwarves the extra time of having to hunt around for BOTH a pick and a shield and thus gets them into the fight faster.  It also avoids the aforementioned possibility of not being able to wield both a pick and a shield leaving your dwarf potentially running into battle with just a shield.  Pick also has an advantage over sword & shield in that using picks provides extra insurance against the situation where your miners fall into hot magma or down a cave dragon’s throat with the fortresses only picks and you don’t have metal to replace them.

== Iron Armored Peasant Best Weapon Test (Tested by: RoyalAssassin3) ==
<u>'''Test description:'''</u> The previous tests established that the pick was the best peasant weapons vs. unarmored foes.  But that’s only half the equation.  Goblins sometimes show up wearing up to iron armor accordingly, this test is to identify which weapon does best against max goblin armor.  I encased both sides in full iron armor (defined as Iron Helm, Iron Chain Mail Shirt, Iron Breastplate, Iron Gauntlets, Iron Greaves, Iron High Boots) so that the only difference between the sides is the weapon being used.

I originally used an arena of 10, but decided I needed a larger sample size and so switched to my 20 test arena and added those results.

Surprisingly, pick maintained its superiority vs. armored (although now tied with the short sword).  Accordingly, I think I can conclusively say that the pick is best for emergency base militia use.  That makes the dwarf in me happy.

== Testing Armor vs. Higher Tier Weapon (Tested by: RoyalAssassin3) ==
<u>'''Test description:'''</u> I read that higher tier weapons slice through lower tier armor like butter.  If that is the case, will someone wearing low tier armor do worse (due to encumberance) vs. an unarmored opponent wielding a higher tier weapon?  These tests seek to answer that question.  As with the tests above, armored is defined as: Helm + Breastplate + Chain Mail + 2 Gauntlets + 2 High Boots + Greaves.

== Super Stacked Ad. Armor vs. Ad. Armor (Tested by: RoyalAssassin3) ==
<u>'''Test description:'''</u> From the armor page you can stack ridiculous amounts of armor and clothes onto one dwarf.  Waladil previously tested 3 mail shirts vs. 1 mail shirt proving that stacked armor helps.  But what about someone wearing: 1 Adamantine (“Ad.”) Helm + 6 Ad. Hoods + 1 Ad. Breastplate + 3 Ad. Mail Shirts + 6 Ad. Cloaks + 2 Ad. Trousers + 1 Ad. Greaves + 2 Ad. Gauntlets + 2 Ad. Mittens + 2 Ad. High boots + 2 Ad. Socks = Super Stacked Armor.

== Quality vs. Quantity Tests (Tested by: RoyalAssassin3) ==
<u>'''Test description:'''</u> I once sent a squad of well-trained adamantine armored and armed dwarves out against a goblin siege and they got utterly slaughtered.  These tests are designed to test quality vs. numbers by pitting a Super Stacked (defined above) Adamantine Armored Grandmaster (in everything) aka. “The Uber Dwarf” vs. 10 worse equipped and worse skilled dwarf opponents pretending to be goblins.

<u>'''Results:'''</u> I was surprised to see no wins by the Uber Dwarf so I started tallying survivors.  Knights won with an average of 6 survivors.  Not terribly surprising though given that the Knights were decently skilled and equipped.  

=== Uber Dwarf v. Copper Knights ===

<u>'''Test description:'''</u> Previous tests showed adamantine slicing through copper like butter.  Likewise with copper swords the knights should just end up rubbing butter all over the Adamantine clad Uber Dwarf.  Will Uber Dwarf emerge victorious this time?

=== Uber Dwarf v. Copper Militia ===

<u>'''Test description:'''</u> Uber Dwarf fared pretty poorly vs. the simulated goblin knights.  So I downgraded the knights to militia.  These poor saps have mere adequate skills in everything and due to budget cuts only get bare bones equipment (Copper Mail Armor + Copper Helm + Copper High Boots + Copper Sword).

<u>'''Results:'''</u> Ok, this is starting to shock me.  I expected Uber Dwarf to make mince meat out of these guys, but he utterly failed.  At least Uber Dwarf killed more of them than the knights.  Clearly numbers matter.

=== Uber Dwarf v. Peasants ===

<u>'''Test description:'''</u> Uber Dwarf is feeling pretty sad right now.  Perhaps slaughtering some unarmed unskilled peasants will help him feel better.  If he can’t beat these he needs to retire or find some friends.

<u>'''Results:'''</u> So apparently a mob of 10 unarmed unskilled peasants can take apart the most legendary warrior possible to obtain in Dwarf Fortress.  Uber Dwarf retires.

=== Dragon v. Shielded Peasants ===

<u>'''Test description:'''</u> So the Uber Dwarf failed and the peasants are getting uppity.  Time to test Dragon vs. Peasants.  This is intended to see whether size matters.  Peasants can batter a dwarf hero to death with their fists, but perhaps several feat of dragon muscle is too much for a dwarf fist to penetrate.  I gave peasants shields to nullify the dragon’s breath weapon.  Wooden shields because they are peasants and I read wooden shields work just as well.  Oaken shields naturally.

<u>'''Results:'''</u> So it was hard to see what happened with all the smoke but the peasants died pretty quick.  Hypotheses: (1) Burning grass roasted the peasants; (2) The first peasant to die from dragon claws got turned into a bonfire when the dragon next breathed which created a chain reaction of roasted peasants; (3) the shield of the first peasant to die became a bonfire and a roasting chain reaction; (4) wooden shield no longer block dragon fire.  Further tests coming.


Amusingly, a single dwarf survived.  I suspect he teleported through an adjacent wall since he was uninjured.

== Combat fatigue and the skill 'Armor User' (by NeckRomancer) ==

Long fights makes dwarves very tired. When a dwarf gets too tired he or she will fall unconscious and become an easy target for the enemy. Can the skill 'Armor User' help a dwarf to fight for longer?

When someone is unconscious in combat, their foes start to do targetted head attacks with increased force. This can sometimes be seen in the combat log, a copper edged weapon that earlier couldn't damage a copper helm can now both damage and break that helmet. It's pretty rare but dwarves have also been observed using a "remove helm" action and immediately follow up with a deadly head-hit, this specific head targetting points towards an unconcious target. Strangulation appears to be the most common type of death, but that could be because of the test design and may not be true for real combat.

I don't know the attribute values of arena dwarves. My assumption is that they are identical, because dwarves in the arena all seem to tire around the same time. The median Endurance value of a dwarf is 1000, so this might be what Arena dwarves have. Since Fortress dwarves can double their initial attribute by training, one can expect them to do a bit better than an Arena dwarf.

<u>'''Tester's conclusion:'''</u>
Endurance is a big factor in these fights, easily seen by the many flashing X's that appear. The fighters also gets the Tired, Exhausted and Over-exerted statuses. I run 100 matches at the same time, and the 1v7 took almost twice as long as the 1v5 to resolve, which hints at just how tired and useless they are near the end.

A high Armor User skill does not appear to help against exhaustion, since 0 and 14 skill have the same outcome. The slightly better performance of the Armor User 14's is not large enough to mean anything, it could be random noise. In the test below, no armor is used, and they actually perform better than in this test, very likely because they don't get tired as quickly.

<u>'''Tester's conclusion:'''</u>
The narrow tunnel clearly gives the elite solo fighter an advantage. Exactly why is harder to say, probably many factors, below is some speculation.

A successful dodge always seem to move the character. Private tests I have run show that Dodge is more effective in 1v1 matches in open terrain, and less effective in a 1-wide tunnel. This is detrimental to the elite in the tunnel, since the high skill is wasted. On the other hand, one can suspect that a surrounded fighter will also suffer a reduced effect from Dodge since there are less free tiles to move to.

It is known that facing is a thing. Meaning that flanking attacks probably can't be shield blocked. The 1-wide tunnel should then make the shield more important since the solo fighter can only be flanked if the group can pass through him first.

A surrounded target should suffer more attacks in the same time-interval, increasing the odds of getting killed.

Endurance might play a role too. If the surrounded solo fighter must perform more defensive actions, she will get exhausted faster.

== Armor weight and combat fatigue (by NeckRomancer) ==

Does heavier armor weight make a dwarf more tired? The idea behind the test is to make an armored fighter so tired that she looses about half of her fights against unarmed opponents. Then, by changing the weight of her armor, it should be noticeable in the win-ratio if heavier or lighter equipment make her fall unconscious from exhaustion earlier or later.

== Mutilated and mangled corpses per weapon type (by NeckRomancer) ==

Mangled corpses can't be re-animated.

note: ''When the pickaxe was tested, the raws were edited so that it uses the Axe skill instead of Mining, since the Mining skill can't be increased in the Arena. The default file is ...\DF\raw\objects\item_weapon.txt but each save also has its own copy of it.''

Mutilated corpse = missing a limb (examples: neck, hand, lower body) (not: teeth, nose, ear, finger)<br> Mangled corpse = head, upper body or lower body destroyed (examples: cloven asunder, explodes into gore, crushed)

<u>'''Tester's conclusion:'''</u>

Dwarf 28: How fragile we are...  I must not succumb to fear!

edit: All weapons used in this test were made out of copper. In a recent fort I played, a dwarf with an Adamantine battle axe were able to mutilate a giant with a hack to the head. Not sure how other materials will perform.

== Skilled Miner vs average soldier (by NeckRomancer) ==

Mining is very easy to train up. But how good is a miner with an armor piercing pick in a fight? Training soldiers can take a long time. In this test the soldiers only get half the skill of the miner. Please note that soldier training also boosts the attributes more than mining does, the effect of that is unknown.

note: ''When the pickaxe was tested, the raws were edited so that it uses the Axe skill instead of Mining, since the Mining skill can't be increased in the Arena. The default file is ...\DF\raw\objects\item_weapon.txt but each save also has its own copy of it.''

== Hit locations (by NeckRomancer) ==

What body parts are hit the most?

This test is done with armor to prevent mutilation. It is untested if a lost limb can be hit again, it's just assumed that it can't. The face however can't be protected by armor, so parts like ears and noses can still be lost, and this can have an effect on the outcome. 

Each test is only run for a few seconds to prevent fighters from falling unconscious (from pain or fatigue). Since an unconscious target always seem to be hit in the head, this would skew the result.

A script was used to count the hits and their locations. But the script wasn't perfect. Some face hits damage multiple parts, a tongue hit can/will also do damage to the cheek for example, which will result in double counting in those particular cases. There can also be other errors that are undiscovered. That is why the total number of hits are slightly lower than what is obtained by adding all individual hits together.

edit:''a script error was found, hands and fingers as well as feet and toes were counted together, column labels have been adjusted to show this, no data has been changed''

<u>'''Tester's conclusion:'''</u>

It appears that all weapons use the same hit location calculation. There is one minor trend where the left limbs of the body are hit more, which could be explained by the attacker holding the weapon in his right hand. War hammers and Maces have 9.5% and 9.0% head hits respectively, slightly higher than average, I think this can be explained by the fact that blunt weapons can kill through helmets and after that happen that particular fight is over and no longer generate any new hits and this will skew the numbers in favor of the head.

A thought on low vs high boots: Even though gauntlets are more likely to break, the boots are also hit fairly often. If there is a concern about them breaking, the low boots would be the better choice, since the legs have a low chance of being hit the greaves / leggings are pretty safe already and the lower body have several overlapping armor pieces. The lower legs have a low chance of getting hit, so having double armor on them is not that important, especially when compared to the risk of loosing the boots entirely if they were to break. An item breaks the 5th time it takes damage, and blunt weapons of any material, especially the war hammer, can damage and break all kinds of armor (not tested on adamantium).

As a side note: Leggings have both the [shaped] and [elastic] tags, which seems incorrect since they should be mutually exclusive. It appears as if leggings can stop blunt damage just like greaves do, but they will never get damaged by blunt hits.

<u>'''Methodology:'''</u>

All experiments featured 100 fights. When there were no survivors the fight was excluded from the final numbers. For the unskilled test 5 15x15 dwarf combats were generated in a classic arena map and then the map was reloaded 20 times. For the other tests 25 5x5 dwarf combats were generated in  forest arena map inside 7x7 rooms made of tree trunks and the map was reloaded 4 times.

Steel Short swords were chosen for their variety of attacks.

Tests were done at different skill levels to vary the momentum of successful strikes (1.0x at unskilled, 1.5x at adept, 2.0x at grand master.)

<u>'''Notes:'''</u>

The objective of the test is to study some claims made in [[Armor#Encumbrance]]. Older testing indicated an unskilled peasant wearing heavy armor may fight at two-thirds the speed of a naked dwarf [[http://www.bay12forums.com/smf/index.php?topic=111414.0| link]].

"Full Steel Armor" is used to mean breastplate, greaves, helm, gauntlets, high boots, and mail shirt.

Steel short swords wielded by typical dwarves will not pierce steel mail shirts. Instead the benefit of shaped armor in this situation was to decrease blunt damage from torso and leg strikes.

Weapon skill likely affects parrying chance as well as momentum, so varying skill level ultimately influenced combat length, and therefore the importance of fatigue, in an unknown way. Collapse from over-exertion was common.

The 95% confidence intervals for these results are about +-10 combats.

<u>'''Tester's conclusions:'''</u>

In no sample set of 100 combats was a statistically significant difference from equality of the groups observed. Furthermore at low and medium weapon skill levels the medium-armored dwarves performed somewhat better. These results are consistent with the advice that for military dwarves with low armor skill, the encumbrance of wearing multiple pieces of 15+ weight armor makes the extra protection not worth it. However, the difference does not appear to be backbreaking, metaphorically speaking. For comparison, in Neckromancer's win ratio tests above, a naked but shielded axedwarf with 2 ranks in each relevant skill defeated a similar dwarf with 1 rank in each relevant skill 83 out of 100 times.

== Best weapon to fight dragons (tested by: Mimi-limonite) ==
3 dwarves with full iron armor + shields and decent skills are set against 1 default dragon. 4 variations are tested: swords, spears, warhammers and axes.

<u>'''Times run:'''</u> 200, each, 800 total

<u>'''Initial setup:'''</u> 3 dwarves with skill level 9(professional) in fighter, dodger, armor user, shield user, observer and discipline, skill level 6(talented) in biting, kicking, striking and wrestling, and skill level 9 in the skill for their weapon(axedwarf, speardwarf, etc.) are tested. They are given an iron breastplate, iron greaves, high boots, and gauntlets, iron shields and helms, as well as an iron warhammer/battle axe/short sword/spear. The dragon had a level 6 skill in observer, biter, archer, fighter, striker and dodger, which are the default ones for a dragon spawned in the arena.
They are put in a 4x4 room with the dragon in one corner and the dwarves in the opposite one. This is done in 40 rooms, and repeated 5 times for each weapon.

<u>'''Tester's conclusion:'''</u>
Hammerdwarves are the worst by far, and axedwarves after them. Speardwarves and swordsdwarves have very similar survival rates but speardwarves lost significantly less, suggesting that when swordsdwarves win, it's less likely some of them died while doing so, while speardwarves are more reliable.

<u>'''Notes:'''</u>
(*) due to ease of counting, dwarf wins and draws are counted together, as it was much easier to count the number of remaining dragons(equivalent to dragon wins), ie number of surviving team 1 members, than check every room individually.

== Warhammer Material Testing (Testing by Jonaut) ==
It has been debated many times as to if a [[blunt]] weapon's material affects its usefulness. This data was only collected using [[war hammer]]s, though it can be presumed that it also applies to [[mace]]s.
[[Platinum]] should theoretically do the most damage, it has quite low [[impact elasticity]], and an exceptionally high [[density]]. [[Steel]], on the other hand, should be quite bad for warhammers, it has a very low density comparatively, and a surprisingly high impact elasticity. [[Silver]] is in the middle, still having more density than steel, yet half that of platinum. Its impact elasticity is much lower than steel's, but higher than platinum's. Silver is the densest weapons-grade metal. It is also much more accessible, as platinum is not a weapons-grade metal, meaning it must be made into weapons exclusively through [[strange mood]]s.

<u>'''Platinum vs Steel:'''</u>
Note: The number is the amount of wins it had out of 25, then the percentage of wins.

<u>'''Conclusions:'''</u>
From this data we can make a few crucial inferences. First of all, at low skill levels silver and platinum's weight is a net loss, as it wears the dwarf out faster, and the decreased hit-rate of unskilled dwarves means that a lot of the extra damage is wasted. At high skill levels, the weight is a net gain, as the reduced stamina drain of skilled dwarves and their increased hit-rate leads to the weight giving an extreme damage boost compared to the steel.
We can also infer that platinum's increased density is more detrimental than beneficial, even at grand master level, and silver is a better choice.
Finally, we can infer that at higher levels, for example legendary +20, platinum's damage may surpass the stamina loss, leading it to be more effective than silver. There is, unfortunately, no convenient way to test this theory as arena mode only allows up to grand master skill.
It is also worth noting that high density warhammers, whether they are in the hands of skilled or unskilled dwarves, will offer much greater burst damage, meaning that if the dwarf can kill their opponent before getting tired, they will perform much better than lower density metals. This is particularly true for squads of warhammer dwarves, as an entire squad's quick burst of damage before tiring is likely enough to kill many things.

<u>''Combat Testing''</u>
After a quick test, [[minotaur]]s can be dispatched by a squad of dwarves, unskilled and skilled with platinum warhammers, with the unskilled dwarves taking one death, and the skilled dwarves taking zero damage. [[Bronze colossus]]es easily dispatch the squads, both skilled and unskilled, as it appears their weaponry is unable to damage it. [[Dragons]] are also too strong for the squads, though the deaths were exclusively from the [[dragonfire]], meaning a squad with better [[shield user]] skill would likely have won. [[Roc]]s, being the generally-considered weakest of the [[megabeasts]], was taken out with zero injuries by the skilled squad, and with 5 losses by the unskilled squad. Finally, a [[hydra]] was able to fully dispatch an unskilled squad, but could not inflict even a single injury upon the skilled one.
A squad of unskilled dwarves with only [[iron]] [[spears]] was still able to kill the roc with less losses, only 3, but considering blunt damage's main weakness is pure size, the hammerdwarves did surprisingly well. Against armoured enemies, they would likely fare better than any other weapon.
