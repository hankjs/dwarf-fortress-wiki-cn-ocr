'''Orca men''' are [[animal people]] versions of the common [[orca]], who can be found in [[savage]] [[ocean]]s. They spawn in groups of 3-5 individuals and are generally content to keep to themselves, as they are restricted to the water. They are the joint second largest of all animal people, tied with [[Elephant man|elephant men]] and losing only to [[Sperm whale man|sperm whale men]], being 42 times larger than a [[dwarf]] in comparison. Like their animal counterparts, they may rarely be subject to [[beaching]].

While they can learn and are able to join [[civilization]]s, they never do so, as they are completely [[aquatic]] and cannot survive on the surface.

Some dwarves [[Preferences|like]] orca men for their ''coloration'' and their ''great jumps''.

== Anatomy ==

The orca man has a body shaped like all [[whale men]]– a head on a body with no neck, a right flipper and left flipper attached to the upper body, also a right arm and left arm attached to the upper body, and a tail on the lower body. Each arm is jointed with an elbow, and on each hand has a thumb with two additional fingers. The total size of each arm is twice that of each flipper. Like all whale men, the orca man's fastest form of locomotion is swimming, though he can also climb, crawl, and perform a faster walk-crawl like [[snake]]s and [[merpeople]].

There's no explanation of where the arms and side flippers are attached relative to each other. It might make sense for the arms to be below the flippers, though, so the longer arms don't cover the flippers while swimming. But maybe they are closer together with more dorsal side flippers and more ventral arms. Or maybe they are right on top of each other with the side flipper attached to the shoulder blades of the humanoid arms. On real-world orcas, their flippers are attached to shoulder blades and have bones equivalent to those in human arms, hands, and fingers with humeri, radii, ulnae, carpels, metacarpels, and phalanges.
