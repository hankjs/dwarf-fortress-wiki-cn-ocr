'''Impalas''' are wild [[Creature|animals]] found in [[tropical]] [[savanna]]s and [[grassland]]s, where they appear in herds of 5-10 individuals. These herbivores are a little smaller than the average [[dwarf]] and are entirely benign, doing little but meandering about aimlessly through your surroundings, just waiting to be taken down by a [[hunter]] or [[squad]], only rarely retaliating with bites and kicks. Newborn impalas are known as ''fauns''.

Impalas can be captured in [[cage]] [[trap]]s and [[Animal trainer|trained]] into low-value exotic [[pet]]s. They give equivalent returns to [[goat]]s when [[butcher]]ed. When trained, they become [[grazer]]s, and as such must be assigned to a patch of [[grass]] in order to not have them starve.

Some dwarves [[Preferences|like]] impalas for their ''mighty leaps''.

Tamed impalas reportedly feel better the less [[knowledge]] they possess.
