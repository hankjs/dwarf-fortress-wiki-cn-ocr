'''Damselflies''' are a species of unremarkable [[above ground]] [[vermin]] who may be found in [[pool]]s. They will not appear in areas during the [[Calendar|winter]], and can not be caught in [[building|built]] [[animal trap]]s, but can be caught with a "Capture a Live Land Animal" job if the dwarf happens to find one. All damselflies possess Legendary [[skill]] in [[Climber|climbing]].

Some dwarves [[Preferences|like]] damselflies for their ''coloration''.
