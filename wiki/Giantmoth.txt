Despite differences in real life, in ''Dwarf Fortress'', the '''giant moth''' is physically exactly like a [[giant thrips]]. It, too, lacks any attacks besides [[push]]ing. It has the same size, same bodyparts, same [[wrestling]] ability, same [[flying]] tag and same wings. These giant variations are even more similar to each other than their normal-sized types are; normal [[moth]]s are significantly faster than normal [[thrips]], but the giant varieties have the same speed.  Even though it is quite fast, it is still not much of a threat. It is good for [[food]] and [[marksdwarf]] training, but not much else. They are also very short-lived, like all the other giant insects.

Some dwarves [[Preferences|like]] giant moths for their ''coloration''.

Rumours of intelligent, [[Megabeast]]-sized giant moths with a hatred for 3-headed [[Hydra]]s and a tendancy to team up with [[Giant saltwater crocodile|giant saltwater crocodile]]s remain, to this day, uncomfirmed.
