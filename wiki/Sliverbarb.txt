'''Sliver barb''' is an [[above ground|aboveground]] [[crop]] that can be [[brewing|brewed]] into '''gutter cruor''', a low-[[value]] [[alcohol]], or [[Milling|milled]] into black [[dye|sliver dye]], a high-value dye.  It only grows in [[evil]] areas - since [[human]] and [[elf|elven]] [[civilization|civilizations]] never live in these areas, your [[trade|trading partners]] won't have [[seed|seeds]] for it. To get this plant, your [[dwarves]] will need to brave the [[evil weather]] and [[plant gathering|pull it from the earth]] themselves.

Some dwarves [[Preferences|like]] sliver barbs for their ''wicked thorns''.

Dwarves tend to be surprised at the fact that they appear more gray than silver. This may be due to misreading the name while drunk. The plant is thorny and rhymes with "liver".

There have been reports of dungeon masters mandating export bans on sliver barbs due to them apparently being "way too strong for a 1st-level plant", whatever that means. However, these stories are obviously false because dungeon masters can't make mandates.
