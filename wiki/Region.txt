[[File:Resources worldgen.png|thumb|'The late Murk' Region]]

A '''region''' or '''subregion''' is a named world area, a continuous set of tiles on the world map with the same or similar [[biome]]s, and the same [[Surroundings|alignment]]. The entire region will be either evil, neutral, or good. 

In [[advanced world generation]], regions are classified by size: 24 or fewer tiles is a small subregion, one with 25 to 99 is a medium subregion, and one with 100 or more is a large subregion.

== Biome ==
Regions must be the same or similar types of [[biome]]s with any degree of surroundings savagery. Some different [[biome]]s can occur in the same region as follows:

{| class="wikitable"
! Region name
! [[Wetland]]
! [[Forest]]
! Grassland
! [[Hills]]
! Desert
! Lake
! Tundra
! Glacier
! Ocean
! Mountains|-
! Biome(s)| [[Swamp]], [[marsh]]| [[Broadleaf forest]], [[coniferous forest]], [[taiga]]| colspan="2" | [[Grassland]], [[savanna]], [[shrubland]]| [[Badlands]], [[rocky wasteland]], [[sand desert]]| [[Lake]]| [[Tundra]]| [[Glacier]]| [[Ocean]]| [[Mountain]]|}

== Temperature, elevation and volcanism ==

Even if drainage and rainfall are the same in two tiles, if the temperature is different enough that one tile is a [[tundra]] or [[glacier]], and an adjacent tile is not, they will be in different subregions.

Similarly, any tile with 300 or more elevation will be a [[mountain]] tile, and any tile with less than 100 elevation will be an [[ocean]] tile, neither of which form subregions with other land biomes. Volcanism is usually irrelevant for subregions, but a [[volcano]] tile adjacent to at least one mountain tile will be generated as if it had an elevation of 400, and will count as a mountain tile.

Additionally, during world generation, lakes will sometimes be generated in the place of tiles that would usually have an elevation higher than 100, in which case they again do not form subregions with adjacent land tiles.<!--could do some research on lakes, but not sure how to get them to generate consistently enough for that -->
