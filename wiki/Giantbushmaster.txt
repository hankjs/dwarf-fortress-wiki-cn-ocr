'''Giant bushmasters''' are [[giant animal]] counterparts of the common [[bushmaster]] who can be found in [[savage]] [[tropical]] moist [[broadleaf forest]]s. Like their smaller relatives, they have a [[syndrome|venomous]] bite that can kill a dwarf in one go. Of course, they're also large enough to just tear limbs off completely without bothering with poison; after all, massive blood loss causes death even quicker than paralytic suffocation. Luckily, they're not aggressive, and will flee contact with your dwarves, despite being more than four times as large.

Excellent [[mass pitting|pit]] creatures, if you can capture and [[animal training|tame]] them. Strangely they are considered [[mount|exotic mounts]], so if giant bushmasters are arriving onto your map as part of an [[elf|elven]] [[siege]], be warned - they are extremely dangerous. Luckily, like all other species of snake they take the extent of their lives to reach their maximum size, but because of their bite, giant bushmaster juveniles are still extremely dangerous.

Some dwarves [[preferences|admire]] giant bushmasters for their ''deadly bite''.
