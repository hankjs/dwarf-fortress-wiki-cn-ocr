Despite their status as giants, reputation for being ferocious in combat, and propensity for becoming enraged, '''giant honey badgers''' aren't all that dangerous to anything more than a couple lone civilians, being easily beaten by any military dwarf or small group of dogs.

Some dwarves [[like]] giant honey badgers for their ''great size'', ''underground communities'' and ''stripes faces''.
{{D for Dwarf}}
Especially because this thing is a giant, the giant honey badger '''''[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4r7wHMg5Yjg still]''''' don't care.
