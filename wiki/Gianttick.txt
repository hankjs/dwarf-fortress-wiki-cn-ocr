'''Giant ticks''' are the non-vermin variety of [[tick]]s.  They carry the {{token|MOUTH_SUCK_ATTACK|c}} creature variation tag, and can in fact suck blood from a dwarf.  In form and capability they are essentially a toothless, webless [[giant cave spider|giant spider]], and as such are relatively no danger to your dwarves; however, if cornered and attacked, they can make quick work of a single, untrained and unarmored dwarf.  Having an additional pair of legs gives them more resilience compared to giant insects, and less chance to get a fatal brain injury, but they are easily taken out by a military squad or [[hunter]].
It is highly recommended to either take it down by [[bolt]], or have an [[armor]]ed soldier take care of it, as even a single bite can incapacitate an unarmored dwarf. 
They are ubiquitous, living for only two years, so they are better utilized as [[prepared meal|roasts]] than [[pet]]s.
