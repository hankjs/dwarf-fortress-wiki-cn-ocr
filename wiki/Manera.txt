'''Maneras''' are rare, [[evil]]-aligned, four-armed [[creature]]s found in subterranean [[cavern]]s, exclusively on the second layer and occasionally in sieges. When spawning in the caverns, they spawn one at a time and lurk in the underground, occasionally pathing to your fortress and attacking [[dwarves]] who may cross their way. Maneras are the size of a dwarf and may prove a threat to civilians, but an equipped [[military]] squad will make quick work of them. All maneras are born with Legendary [[skill]] in [[Climber|climbing]].

Maneras are intelligent creatures, capable of learning at half the speed of a civilized one, but are not capable of speech. Because of this, dwarves will not [[butcher]] them, limiting their use to [[live training]] and occupying space in your [[refuse]] [[stockpile]]. Сivilized maneras may gain non-military professions among goblin society. They can't be spawned in the [[object testing arena]].

Maneras, along with [[troll]]s, [[ogre]]s, and [[blizzard man|blizzard men]], can act as livestock for evil civilizations with access to them.

Some dwarves [[Preferences|like]] maneras for their ''long arms''.
