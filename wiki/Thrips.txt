'''Thrips''' are a species of unremarkable [[above ground]] [[vermin]] who may be found in any non-freezing [[biome]]. They may not be caught in [[animal trap]]s. All thrips possess Legendary [[skill]] in [[Climber|climbing]].

Some dwarves [[Preferences|like]] thrips for their ''prolific breeding''.
