'''Mountain halls''' ([[File:icon_site_fortress.png]] / {{Raw Tile|Ω|0:0:1}}) are the procedurally generated [[site]]s of the "deep dwarves", located far beneath the [[mountain]]s. They can be accessed via down-stairs found in underground [[Tunnel|tunnels]], but have no direct connection to the surface. These sites are found in the interior of mountain [[biome]]s at about the depth of the first [[cavern]] layer. (Notice the contrast with [[fortress]]es, which appear along the ''edges'' of mountain ranges and connect to both the surface and the depths.)

A mountain hall complex typically spans a couple of levels, connected to the tunnel above by a 1x1 staircase. One level is a labyrinth of 2x2 bedrooms, which (in an inhabited hall) may contain [[bed]]s, [[cabinet]]s, and scattered [[clothing]]. The other level comprises large halls filled with [[smelter]]s or [[forge]]s. Overall, the pattern closely resembles a small section of the procedurally generated world-gen dwarf fortresses. A single map tile marked as a mountain hall site may contain several such complexes along the length of the tunnel. As can be seen on the [[Embark|embark map]], mountain hall sites (just like the sites of other races) can span an area nearly as large as, and not necessarily aligned with, a full region map tile.

These sites tend to be much less heavily populated than dwarf [[hillock]]s, but some civilian or off-duty military inhabitants can be found in the bedrooms or near the [[workshop]]s. In addition, military dwarves will patrol the tunnel and cavern in the vicinity of the entrance stair – in [[adventurer mode]], meeting these may be your first indication of the presence nearby of a mountain hall.
