{{file|prefs/world_gen.txt}}

The '''world_gen.txt''' file stores presets for [[advanced world generation]]. If saved in-game, the file is created in the <code>prefs/</code> folder, and can be manually edited to use values that are outside the limits allowed by the in-game interface; the location of the <code>prefs</code> [[Game folders and files|folder]] depends on the [[Settings#Portable_mode|portable mode setting]].
