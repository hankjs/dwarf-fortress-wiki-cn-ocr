'''Merpeople''' are [[fanciful]] [[creature]]s that can be found in [[good]]-aligned [[ocean]]s. They can be seen swimming in pods of 3-6 individuals. They are somewhat larger than [[dwarves]], but are also benign and will avoid confrontations, should a dwarf accidentally fall into their ocean. Male merpeople are known as ''mermen'', while the females are known as ''mermaids''.

Merpeople are intelligent, can speak and have the ability to equip items, but they do not produce their own equipment. Being learning creatures, they cannot be [[Animal trainer|trained]] or [[butcher]]ed. Merpeople can only survive in [[water]] - if removed from it, they will air-drown.

Some dwarves [[Preference|like]] merpeople for their ''tails''.

{{D for Dwarf}}
Merperson parts are no more [[value|valuable]] than those of domestic animals. This is a moot point, however, as merpeople are intelligent enough that dwarves refuse to butcher them, making [http://www.bay12forums.com/smf/index.php?topic=25967.0 merperson genocide] in the name of profit absolutely useless; although, nothing is stopping you from committing merperson genocide just for the fun of it.
