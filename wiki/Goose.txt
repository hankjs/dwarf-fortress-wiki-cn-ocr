'''Geese''' are [[domestic animal|domestic]] waterfowl that can also be found in wild populations. A male goose is called a ''gander'', and young geese are called ''goslings''. Of the common domestic [[egg]]-laying animals, the goose is the second largest; only the [[turkey]] is larger. The turkey, however, requires two years to reach full size and provides only a couple more meat, meaning the goose provides similar meat in half the time.

Because of their good size, the fact they reach adulthood and full size in only one year, and low [[embark]] cost, geese are, cost-wise, perhaps the best starter animals for the [[meat industry]] or as sources of [[bone]]s. Although they lay eggs, they lay the fewest eggs of all domestic birds, making [[guineafowl]] or turkey more attractive for eating eggs, while goose eggs are used to raise geese for slaughter. 

Note that geese can fly, even while assigned to [[pasture]]s. If they get up on a roof you will experience a large amount of spam as [[Dwarf|dwarves]] attempt to return them to their pasture. This can be avoided by keeping them away from elevated surfaces that your dwarves cannot access. Alternatively, simply remove them from the pasture to prevent further repasturing jobs.

Some dwarves [[Preferences|like]] geese for their ''formation flying''.

{{D for Dwarf}}
Geese are prone to inconvenience dwarves by picking up and misplacing important items for no apparent purpose other than annoy them. A single goose can lead to dozens of job canceling reports as every dwarf in the vicinity converges on the dreadful bird to reclaim the stolen goods. They are especially keen on stealing percussion [[instrument|instruments]] with a bell component.
