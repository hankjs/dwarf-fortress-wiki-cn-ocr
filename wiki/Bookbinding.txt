A '''book binding''' is made from stone, wood, metal or glass. They are made at a craftsdwarf's workshop using [[stone]] by a [[stonecrafter]] or [[wood]] by a [[woodcrafter]] , using [[metal]] [[bar]]s at the [[metalsmith's forge]] by a [[metalsmith]], or [[glass]] at a [[glass furnace]] by a [[glassmaker]].

Book bindings are stockpiled under Finished Goods > Tools.

A written-on [[quire]] can be bound into a [[book]] by combining it with [[thread]] and a book binding. Bookbinding is done in the [[craftsdwarf's workshop]] by a dwarf with the [[bookbinding]] labor.
