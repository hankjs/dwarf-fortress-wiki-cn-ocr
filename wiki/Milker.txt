'''Milker''' is the skill associated with the '''milking''' [[labor]]. Milkers will [[milk]] creatures in a [[farmer's workshop]], requiring an empty bucket. There are several milkable animals in-game, including [[cow|cows]], [[donkey|donkeys]], [[sheep]] and [[horse|horses]]. [[Milk]] is the ingredient for [[cheese]], which in turn can be used to make high-quality [[food]] at the [[kitchen]].

{{D for Dwarf}}
The exact procedure of milking is a prime example of co-evolution: The dwarf will first place a bucket in the workshop and then lead the cow to the bucket. They will then promptly leave and let the cow do her business. Once the cow is finished she'll then give the dwarf a whistle and will be led back to her pasture, leaving behind a full bucket to be carried off.
