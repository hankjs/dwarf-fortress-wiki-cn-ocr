'''Sheep''' are common [[Domestic animal|domestic livestock]] available to [[dwarf]] and [[human]] civilizations. Sheep can be [[shearer|sheared]] once every 300 days to yield [[wool]], which can be used to make low-value [[cloth]]. In addition to the standard [[meat industry]] products, sheep also supply wool when [[butcher]]ed. ''Rams'' (male sheep) have two horns which they use for defense (and which your dwarves can use for [[craft]]ing); ''ewes'' (female sheep) can be milked, and that milk can then be [[cook]]ed or made into [[cheese]]. Until grown up, their offspring of both sexes are called ''lambs''.

Sheep are [[grazer]]s, and require a moderately-sized [[pasture]] to survive. However, sheep eat far less grass than [[cow|cattle]], making them an excellent base animal for combined meat, cheese, and cloth industries. 

Notably, sheep are the smallest creature capable of producing wool, and their wool is equivalent in value to that of all other [[shearable]] creatures.

Because ewes and rams have the same total body size, the added horns on rams actually make the rest of their body slightly smaller than an ewe's.

Some dwarves [[Preferences|like]] sheep for their ''wool'' and their ''tendency to flock''.
