'''Giant ibexes''' are not a direct threat to your fortress, as they won't actively seek out targets and are generally skittish. However, these animals can be quite dangerous to any dwarves foolish enough to [[Creature#Agitation|agitate]] or otherwise antagonize them. They have hooves, horns, and enough mass to cause considerable damage. They can even pose a threat to your militia with heavy blunt and stabbing damage.
