'''Floating guts''' are disturbing subterranean [[creature]]s that appear to be little more than slimes containing a set of organs, found at the second and third layer of the [[cavern]]s. Because of this lack of body parts, it's extremely easy to damage organs on them, and thus relatively easy to kill. They have no attacks except for the default [[push]], which may sometimes injure unarmored [[dwarves]].

These can be trained as exotic [[pet]]s with an [[animal trainer]], having a value of 10. They are genderless, though, and live to a maximum of 30 years, so your supply is limited to what you find on embark. Butchering one will give you a small amount of [[meat]] items and some raw hide, so they are of very limited use.

Unlike most creatures, they may not be spawned in the [[object testing arena]].

Some dwarves [[Preferences|like]] floating guts for their ''freakish appearance''.
