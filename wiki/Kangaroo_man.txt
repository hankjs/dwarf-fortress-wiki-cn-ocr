'''Kangaroo men''' are humanoid versions of the common [[kangaroo]] and a [[Creature|species]] of unremarkable [[animal people]], save for their stronger-than-average kick, found in [[savage]] [[desert]] and [[temperate]] [[biome]]s. They are about a third heavier than a [[dwarf]], but should pose no real threat unless provoked.

Like other savage animal people, kangaroo men may occasionally join [[civilization]]s, becoming full-fledged citizens who may appear in your fortress as [[visitor]]s or be playable in [[adventurer mode]].

As the animal person template does not remove it, kangaroo women produce [[milk]].

Some dwarves [[Preferences|like]] kangaroo men for their ''pouches'' and their ''great leaps''.
