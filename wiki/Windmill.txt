:''For a basic overview of how the different machine parts work and work together, see [[Machine component|machinery]].''

A '''windmill''' is a [[machine component]] that provides [[power]] via [[Weather#Wind | wind]] on the surface of a fortress map. 

In order for the windmill to generate power, its center tile must have the "outside" [[Tile attributes|attribute]]. A windmill can produce 40, 20, or (rarely) 0 units of power, depending on how much wind there is in a map. If its power output is zero, but you've just built it, give it a few ticks (fifty or so) to start spinning. It may need to reorient itself to align with the wind direction first. If that doesn't work, there may still be hope. 

If a windmill built on solid ground did not generate any power, then you simply didn't have enough wind on your map and would never be able to use windmills. While this may still be true for some maps, there are numerous reports in the Steam version of elevation and location affecting the power output. If a windmill at ground level does not generate power, placing the windmill on a platform at a higher elevation can sometimes make the windmill begin generating power again. 

: (* The amount of wind is largely based on the latitude at which your fortress is located on the [[World generation|world]] map. See [[Weather#Wind|Wind]].)

Designate a windmill with the ({{Menu icon|b|m|m|sep=-}}) keys. Constructing a windmill requires [[carpentry]]. 

[[File:Windmill animation.gif|left]][[File:windmill_anim.gif|right]]The power generated by a windmill is transmitted either horizontally through the surrounding twelve tiles, or downward through its center tile. If you wish to use the center tile, you must first [[channel]] out the central tile and build the windmill on top of an existing [[axle|vertical axle]] or [[gear assembly]] (or the actual machine you wish to power). As the center tile of the windmill has an implied floor, this does not permit passage as long as the windmill stands.

When building a windmill on top of an existing axle or assembly, you might get a "no access" message, even if your dwarves can reach the center space of the windmill. You need to build a floor so that there's a place to stand next to one of the nine windmill squares (i.e. one space between the standing platform and the windmill axle). Spaces next to the windmill's axle (i.e. within the 3×3 building area) aren't enough to build it.

Due to what is assumed to be a bug, windmills can sometimes transmit their power through a solid floor without channeling. They only have this effect if the windmill is built ''first'', and whatever it's powering ''second''; however, this does not always work reliably.

Putting a windmill directly on top of a gear you disengage can cause the windmill to collapse, so don't try that unless it says the windmill has a stable foundation. (copied over from the [[Pressure_plate#Latching_Pressure_Plates|Pressure plate]] article)

As with other machines, windmills freeze if the floor under them is natural ice.

==Synchronization==
Windmills can be synchronized using [https://www.reddit.com/r/dwarffortress/comments/5cxv5t/science_i_have_found_a_way_to_synchronize/this] method.

[[Water wheel]]s don't cause a [[cave-in]] when they collapse. Their central tile, however, turns the tiles below into indoor tiles. You can deconstruct the supported gear assembly to make all windmills start at once by building a number of hanging [[gear assembly|gear assemblies]], [[axle]]s, and waterwheels connected to a single supported gear assembly.
