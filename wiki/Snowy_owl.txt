'''Snowy owls''' are a species of [[Creature|bird]] who can be found spawning individually in [[tundra]]s. While carnivorous, they are benign and under half the size of a [[cat]], doing nothing but fly across the area aimlessly, proving no threat to a [[dwarf]] whatsoever. All snowy owls are born with Legendary [[skill]] in [[Climber|climbing]].

Snowy owls can be captured in [[cage]] [[trap]]s and [[Animal trainer|trained]] into cheap exotic [[pet]]s. They produce a tiny amount of returns when [[butcher]]ed and lay a meager amount of [[egg]]s if placed in a [[nest box]], being only really useful as livestock if no domestic birds are available.

Some dwarves [[Preferences|like]] snowy owls for their ''coloration'' and their ''yellow eyes''.
