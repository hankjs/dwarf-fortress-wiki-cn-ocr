'''Giant saltwater crocodiles''' are the much larger giant [[Creature|cousins]] of the [[saltwater crocodile]] who can be found in [[savage]] [[tropical]] [[wetland]]s. At over 6 tons, they are among the largest creatures in savage environments, being only slightly smaller than a [[cyclops]], and they know well how to use their massive [[size]]; a [[dwarf]] caught by a giant saltwater crocodile has a good chance of being torn to shreds in seconds, and they are eager to scare civilians or inexperienced soldiers into the water for an even quicker death. If you are having trouble with giant saltwater crocs, fight them with the most well equipped and experienced members of your [[military]], or use [[cage]] [[trap]]s.

These monsters may be worth more alive, however. While their [[pet]] value is actually lower than that of their normal counterparts (500 vs 700), if the player manages to capture and [[Animal trainer|train]] them, giant saltwater crocodiles are ''the'' best [[egg]]-layers in the entire game; not only do they lay a staggering amount of eggs for [[egg production]] (20 to 70 each time), the crocs may also be hatched and [[butcher]]ed into a colossal source of [[meat]], [[bone]]s and [[prepared organs]]. An adult giant saltwater towers over a [[jabberer]], and if used as a fortress defense force, the [[goblin]] rabble will only be able to match your beasts by employing [[cave dragon]]s.

Some dwarves [[Preferences|like]] giant saltwater crocodiles for their ''strength''.
