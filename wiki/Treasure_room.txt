'''Treasure rooms''' are procedurally generated reward chambers inside specific [[site]]s (for example, [[labyrinth]]s, [[mysterious dungeon]]s, or [[vault]]s) and are always guarded by [[megabeast]]s or other overprotective [[creature]]s. They may contain [[artifact]]s (such as a [[primordial remnant]]) or [[Item_quality#Masterpiece|masterfully]] crafted [[armor]] or [[weapon]]s. You may freely take what you want in these rooms after you survive the encounter.
