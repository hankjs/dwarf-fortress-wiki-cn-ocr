A '''zoo''' is a [[meeting hall]] defined around a built [[cage]] or [[restraint]] that is not designated for "[[justice]]" (i.e. [[jail]]). Zoos can be assigned to specific dwarves, or left unassigned for communal enjoyment. An unassigned zoo seems to function like a regular [[meeting hall]], where idle dwarves will congregate. Dwarves may receive positive [[emotion]]s from admiring a zoo's [[restraint]]s, [[cage]]s, and any [[preference|preferred]] [[creature]]s and may consider them "tastefully arranged" (like [[furniture]] in [[sculpture garden]]s).

Caged [[grazer|grazing]] animals will eventually get hungry and die if not fed, making them impractical for use in a zoo. [[Hateable]] [[vermin]] can inspire negative thoughts in visiting dwarves, and should similarly be avoided. Although filling your zoo with your fortress's prisoners seems very dwarfy, a mix of regular animals is more likely to match your dwarves' [[preference]]s. A zoo can even function without animals, though the likelihood of positive emotions will be reduced.
