'''Lion men''' are [[animal people]] variants of the common [[lion]] who can be found in [[savage]] [[tropical]] flatlands. They spawn in groups of 1-5 individuals and can pose a threat to anyone who provokes them. In terms of size, they are a little over twice the weight of the average [[dwarf]]. While they are smaller than the similar [[tiger man]], their great size still makes them dangerous in combat.

Like other savage animal people, they can join [[civilization]]s, become [[historical figure]]s, appear as [[visitor]]s and be playable in [[adventurer mode]].

Some dwarves [[Preferences|like]] lion men for their ''roars''.

Lion men are known for their distinctive battle cry of ''Lion men, lion men, lion men, ho!''
