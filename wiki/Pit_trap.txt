A '''pit trap''' is a type of large and extremely effective [[trap design|trap]]. In essence, a pit trap is a multiple z-level drop with optional nasty surprises waiting at the bottom. Retracting [[bridge]]s can be used to drop enemies to their doom; raising bridges can lob them in from afar. Fluid [[flow]] can wash your enemies into your pit, while [[weapon trap]]s and marksdwarves can convince enemies to dodge right on in. A barrage of [[minecart]]s can also motivate your foes to experience the wonders at the bottom of your trap.

Pit traps are sadly ineffective against [[flying]] enemies, and [[list of creatures by adult size#bridge|"large"]] enemies are immune to bridge-traps (but can still be pitted by other means). 

Although you can just leave a captured foe as is, it's much more fun and dwarfy to turn them into something useful. A pitted goblin [[siege]] or [[titan]] can be used in a large variety of ways, all of them violent. Note that this is a distinct idea from [[mass pitting]], although one can certainly lead into the other.

The nature of a pit trap means that you can simply keep dropping more visitors in. Any current occupants may suffer injury from falling arrivals; the new arrivals, meanwhile, suffer the falling damage. When you combine different enemy forces, the survivors will likely fight to be lord of the pit. 

In general, falls of 1-2 z-levels are unlikely to cause significant damage to your dwarves, and goblins have been seen to fall more than four with only light bruising and stunning. Large falls (30+ z-levels) will tend to cause the hapless victim to explode upon impact. The minimum drop with 100% mortality appears to be around 25 z-levels.<sup>[http://www.bay12forums.com/smf/index.php?topic=110718.0]

You can also use it for [[unfortunate accident|organic waste disposal]]. Your own dwarves will gleefully march across bridges and along precarious drops. If your pit trap should happen to engage while a [[noble]] is leading a group of legendary [[cheese maker]]s across, just consider it an in-depth inspection.

== Improvements ==

Once your visitors have graciously volunteered to enter your pit, you'll want to have some fun surprises for them. Lining the floor of your pit with the [[density|heaviest]] material you can find will maximize falling damage; if your pit is deep enough, creatures may explode upon impact. Pit traps naturally make great [[drowning chamber]]s, but, if you've got some spare [[magma]], why not entomb your enemies in [[obsidian]]? Install some lever-operated [[spike]]s and perforate your captives. Add some raising bridges and fling your enemies around. Drop in some spare rocks and crack some skulls. Install flammable floor [[grate]]s and light the floor on fire. Add [[syndrome]]-inducing creatures or extracts. Add a [[necromancer]] on a balcony and watch siegers battle their departed kin. Or introduce your captives to the denizens of the deepest depths.

A pit with [[fortification]]s constructed or dug into its sides can be used for training your [[marksdwarf|marksdwarves]] on live targets, provided whatever is inside doesn't have a ranged attack of its own. Simply order them to move in behind the fortifications, and they will render whatever is inside into bloody pincushions. If it's something really big, even better; you may want to temporarily ban your military from [[metal]] [[bolt]]s, as weaker [[wood]]en and [[bone]] bolts means more shots are needed to kill and thus more [[experience]]. Because the crossbow [[skill]] cannot be trained with [[danger room]]s, a pitted [[stone]] or metal [[titan]] is a blessing to a properly equipped fortress, as they can be pelted with wooden bolts for eternity without suffering any ill effects.

A pit with fortifications constructed or dug into the sides can also be used to train your siege operators. This works much like marksdwarf training, except that it slower and less effective. It does work against ranged attackers, though, since siege equipment has a longer reach, and is thus (usually) safe to use against enemy bowmen and the like from a good distance away.

All of these design ideas can be combined to build one truly all-purpose trap!
