There are rumours that these simulations were based on a 21st century program that simulated dwarves living in fortresses; however, these are only unsubstantiated rumours, no more. Regardless of their origins, these models were very accurate and effective, and some claim that they formed a significant backbone to the models used by Ubuntu to guide the development of the society and economy throughout the Sol system."</blockquote>

The description of the item says: "A depiction of the fortress using [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Code_page_437 primitive icons] to represent essential structures." There is also an NPC in the quest named [http://www.wowhead.com/npc=38183 Haggis Boatmurder] guarding the plans.
In the same area, but unrelated to the ''Dwarf Fortress'' quest, there are two Dwarves sitting on sandbags in a town:
<blockquote>'''Hargin Mundar says:''' Flood's not so bad. Not as bad as the ones we've had in Ironforge.<br />
'''Junder Brokk says:''' Aye, you mean the one you caused?<br />
'''Hargin Mundar says:''' You watch your tongue, ya blootered chuff! That was an honest mistake!<br />
'''Junder Brokk says:''' You put a floodgate on a channel from the inside and trapped yerself!<br />
'''Hargin Mundar says:''' An honest mistake!<br />
