'''Stingrays''' are cartilaginous [[Creature#Aquatic|fish]] that can be found in [[tropical]] [[ocean]]s and [[lake]]s. Only as large as a [[cat]], they give a small amount of returns if [[butcher]]ed. As fully-sized creatures, they can't be fished by [[Fisherdwarf|fisherdwarves]], but can be caught with a [[drowning chamber]]. An infant stingray is called a ''stingray pup''.

Like real stingrays, they are able to sting enemies with their tails, though they don't have any venom. Unlike real stingrays, however, they do not possess a stinger and thus the sting is more like being slashed with a meaty blade than stabbed with a bony point. Being benign and restricted to water means your dwarves are unlikely to be stung anyway. Being cartilaginous, stingrays won't give [[bone]]s if butchered (though they'll still provide a [[skull]]).

Some dwarves [[Preferences|like]] stingrays for their ''tail spines''.
