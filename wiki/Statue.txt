'''Statues''' are decorative buildings which can be built from the build furniture menu under statue ({{menu icon|b|f|u}}). They can be created from one [[stone]] at the [[stoneworker's workshop]], 3 [[metal]] at a [[metalsmith's forge]], [[sand]] or [[rock crystal]]s at a [[glass furnace]], or [[clay]] at a [[kiln]]. Graphically, statues will display as a sprite of the statue's subject only if the subject is a sentient race, animal, simple monster, or animal person. The statue will appear as a cube if it is any other type of subject. The color will match that of the material used to craft it.

Statues, like [[engraving]]s, depict people, places, things and events drawn from the game's generated history. Unlike engravings they do not display random geometric shapes, such as diamonds. Statues will often depict creatures that the artisan [[preferences|likes or loathes]], or other dwarves surrounded by the creatures they like or loathe. 

Because of their high base [[value]], statues can be quite valuable when crafted from valuable [[material]]s, such as precious [[metal]]s, or when crafted by a highly [[skill]]ed dwarf.  This makes them a good choice for raising the value of a [[zone]] to create a legendary dining room, for instance, or to meet [[noble]]s' requirements for rooms of a certain value.

A meeting area with statues inside is considered a [[sculpture garden]]. Dwarves with no job will spend time at a statue garden appreciating the statues (which generates a happy [[thought]]). In addition to normal [[decoration]]s, a stone or ceramic statue can be glazed by a [[glazer]].

Be careful when placing statues, because dwarves cannot normally move into the tile they occupy. (This also prevents dwarves from smoothing or engraving the floor underneath a statue.) A poorly placed statue can potentially seal off parts of your fortress. One can place a statue instead of a wall on a built floor, which leads to another possible use of statues: you may build a statue on a tile you don't want your dwarves to stand at. That makes an intentional [[cave-in]] much safer to carry out. Statues do not impede the flow of liquids ([[water]], [[magma]]). Creatures can see past statues as they do not completely block line of sight.

During combat, [[dodging]] creatures can move into a statue tile. Dwarves will immediately step out of the statue tile once they recover their bearings. This detail can make statues useful in a [[danger room]], by providing more space for training dwarves to practice dodging without requiring massive numbers of [[spear|training spear]]s and [[mechanism]]s. Statues may also prove useful in archer emplacements to control where your dwarves normally stand, but still allow them a chance to dodge incoming fire.

[[Building destroyer]]s will topple statues (deconstructing them, but not destroying them). This can make statues a useful delaying tactic while your crack military dwarves are finally collecting the [[weapon|arms]] and [[armor]] assigned to them months ago. Note that creatures that topple statues located in [[temple]]s, in either [[fortress mode]] {{cite forum|160118/7144627}}{{cite reddit|8l8x7i}} or [[adventurer mode]], will be cursed (e.g. as a [[werebeast]] or [[vampire]]). In adventurer mode, this can be done by pressing {{k|u}}.

A killed [[iron man]] or [[bronze colossus]] will transform into a masterwork statue upon death (made of [[iron]] or [[bronze]] respectively). The image is randomly generated upon creation, so it probably won't be a statue depicting the actual creature.

Dwarves, left to their own devices, will generally make statues of sentient races and their own limited pool of [[Preference|preferred]] creatures. Most available sprites will require you to specify an image to ever appear in the game. While somewhat tedious, this is among the best ways to personalize your fort. 

To specify an image, create a statue job, then inspect details ([[File:Mag glass icon.png]]) -> Specify image -> Specify a new image -> Creature. You can queue up multiples of the same image via [[work order]]. For rock statues, you may select the stone as well, allowing control of the statue's color. Note that clay and [[porcelain]] statues currently do not allow image specification.

==Graphics==

In the [[premium]] version of the game, statues of creatures will display as a sprite of that creature once placed, the color of which is based on the material used to create the statue. You can specify the creature to be used by inspecting the job. Only images of non-werebeast single-sprite creatures will be shown in statuary. Creatures assembled from multiple sprites such as [[demon]]s, [[forgotten beast]]s, or [[experiment]]s will display as the default cube. [[Werebeast]]s will display as a cube as well. Plants, items, objects, or any other category of subject will also display as a cube. Dwarves, humans, elves, goblins, and kobolds each use a single sprite-- individual clothing and features will not be reflected in statues. These limitations aside, there are 778 different creature sprites to choose from: megabeasts, animal people, and the incredible variety of animals and monsters (including vermin) in the game are all available to decorate your halls. There are also 16 more sprites that statues can have, including the default cube.

Some creatures have different sprites for male and female versions of that creature: chickens, sheep, and deer to name a few. These default to female. To get a male version, creatures are listed in the menu by their "caste name"-- this means to create a male [[sheep]], for example, you will need to search for "ram" instead of "sheep", for a [[blue peafowl]] search "Blue peacock" instead of "blue peafowl". Some creatures have no distinct caste names but '''do''' have visually distinct sprites: [[lion]]s are one such example. To make a male lion with a majestic mane, select "Lion ♂". 

Notable sprites include the [[fire snake]] with sculpted flames, the [[tigerfish]], which hovers eerily above its plinth, and the [[deer man]], which comes in visually distinct male and female flavors.

Here is a large image containing every possible statue sprite alongside the name (including special male names as described above) needed to create it: [[Media:All_statue_sprites.PNG]].
