'''Thrips men''' are [[animal people]] variants of the common [[thrips]] who can inhabit most [[savage]] [[biome]]s. They spawn in groups of 5-10 individuals and are generally content to keep to themselves. In terms of size, they are a little over half the volume of the average [[dwarf]]. All thrips men are born with Legendary [[skill]] in [[Climber|climbing]].

Like other savage animal people, thrips men can join [[civilization]]s, become [[historical figure]]s, appear as [[visitor]]s and be playable in [[adventurer mode]].

Some dwarves [[Preferences|like]] thrips men for their ''prolific breeding''.
