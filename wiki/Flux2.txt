'''Flux''' [[stone]]s are classified as materials that can be used in the creation of [[pig iron]] and [[steel]] at a [[smelter]]. All flux has a material [[value]] of 2, which is twice that of common stone (material value 1), making it preferable for [[workshop]]s, [[construction]], and almost all stone products.  ''(Only [[obsidian]] and some higher-value [[ore]]s have a higher material value for stonework.)''

Note that [[block]]s made out of flux materials ''cannot'' be used in the production of pig iron or steel.

The following stones fall under this reaction class:

:* {{Raw Tile|"|7:7:1}} {{Raw Tile|•|7:1}} [[File:calcite_sprite.png|14px]] [[Calcite]] 
:* {{Raw Tile|░|7:7:1}} {{Raw Tile|•|7:1}} [[File:chalk_sprite.png|14px]] [[Chalk]]
:* {{Raw Tile|`|7:7:1}} {{Raw Tile|•|7:1}} [[File:dolomite_sprite.png|14px]] [[Dolomite]]
:* {{Raw Tile|▓|7:7:1}} {{Raw Tile|•|7:1}} [[File:limestone_sprite.png|14px]] [[Limestone]]
:* {{Raw Tile|▓|7:7:1}} {{Raw Tile|•|7:1}} [[File:marble_sprite.png|14px]] [[Marble]]

All flux stones form [[layer]]s (which are marked on the embark screen as "Flux Layer(s)") except for [[calcite]], which exists as small clusters within other flux layers. Whether or not a site has flux can be determined from the pre-embark screen. [[Limestone]], [[dolomite]] and [[chalk]] form [[sedimentary_layer|sedimentary layers]], which can have large deposits of [[iron]]-bearing ore. [[Marble]] is a [[metamorphic layer]], so it can be found within almost any [[biome]]; notably, marble can be found in the same biome as [[igneous extrusive layer]]s (i.e. near [[volcano]]es), unlike sedimentary layers.

Note that [[borax]], a real life flux, can not be used as a flux stone in the game.

=== Trading for flux ===
If your map has no flux on it (which is a common situation), then you can request it from the [[dwarf|dwarven]] traders (assuming the traders have access to flux, which is not guaranteed*). Make sure you order them from the 'Stone' section, since you can't use flux'' blocks'' to create steel. [[Bituminous coal]] and [[lignite]] might be worth ordering while you're there.

:<nowiki>*</nowiki> If you are able to bring flux stone at [[embark]], you will be able to request it from the [[caravan]] in meetings with the [[liaison]] (as with pretty much everything else), but they aren't likely to bring much, generally 3 or 4 stones of each type. Your [[steel]] industry may be better served by requesting steel bars directly or by buying up everything they have that's made of steel, especially toys, instruments, and crafts, and [[DF2012:Melt item | melting]] it all down.

== Calcium carbonate stones ==
All of the flux stones besides [[dolomite]] are also [[calcium carbonate]] sources, used to make [[quicklime]] and [[milk of lime]] for production of [[parchment]]. The parchment production process therefore depletes non-dolomite flux stones, and you may wish to avoid parchment making if flux is limited.
