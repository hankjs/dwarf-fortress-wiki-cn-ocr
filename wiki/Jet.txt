'''Jet''' is a non-economic dark purple [[stone]] found in large [[cluster]]s in [[sedimentary layer]]s. It is ''not'' [[magma-safe]], and so should only be used where any other stone would suffice, aside from one notable property.

Jet is the most [[density|lightweight]] stone besides [[raw adamantine]] and [[lignite]], ~40% lighter than the next lightest non-economic stone ([[Saltpeter]]). This property makes it preferable for making [[large pot]]s and other commonly-[[hauling|hauled]] items, and absolutely ''inappropriate'' for [[trap|stone-fall traps]] and [[catapult]]s. Likewise, jet [[craft]]s are even more lightweight than normal crafts; this can be very helpful for maximizing [[caravan]] output.

==In Real Life==
In real life, jet is actually a product of decaying wood under extreme pressure, and is an extremely low grade of [[lignite]]. In DF, however, jet is not a source of [[fuel]]. Since it is very soft and easily carved, historically it has been a popular source of jewelry and [[finished goods|crafts]].

'''Jet''', contrary to popular belief, is not addictive and is <s>acceptably dangerous</s> <s>mostly safe</s> perfectly safe to the dwarves. If modded into a fuel, it can <s>not</s> melt steel beams
