A '''Lair''' ([[File:icon_site_lair_burrow.png]]) is the hideout of either a [[megabeast]], a [[semi-megabeast]] or a [[Name#Animal_and_megabeast_names|named]] large predator (usually giant animals, if the said creature manages to kill at least one [[historical figure]] during [[world generation]]). There are three types of lairs: burrow, mound, and wilderness location. In ASCII mode, burrows and mounds are marked as {{Raw Tile|•|0:0:1}} on world map, while wilderness locations are marked as {{Raw Tile|•|2:0:1}}.

== Burrow ==

''(not to be confused with fortress mode [[burrow]]s)''

A burrow is a default type of lair. Most beasts will settle in them, including predatory [[animal]]s, [[werebeast]]s, rare wild [[vampire]]s, certain [[megabeast]]s, and some [[night troll]]s. A burrow typically consists of two small underground chambers connected through narrow tunnels. Lairs of [[megabeast]]s contain all the [[item]]s stolen by them. Burrows of [[night troll]]s have the entrance covered by a [[hatch cover]] and contain some [[furniture]] and [[vermin]] remains.

The entrance of a burrow may be difficult to spot in [[adventurer mode]]; If you are a Hero, the directions in the upper left corner of the screen will navigate you to it. Otherwise, look carefully for downward pointing ramps!

== Mound ==

A mound is home to a [[night troll]], or a whole family of them. The inside of a mound consists of a few rooms which may contain [[furniture]], cutlery, [[food]], [[cage]]s, and [[vermin]] remains.

== Wilderness location ==

A wilderness location is a place inhabited by a [[roc]]. Its appearance doesn't differ from the surrounding terrain, except that it may contain [[item]]s stolen by the beast. Beasts which inhabit wilderness locations often settle in [[cave]]s, instead. Roc lairs have a [[nest]] for them to use and it often contains roc eggs.
