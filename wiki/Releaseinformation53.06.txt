{{release notes}}

:Continuing to add improvements to the Siege Update. Some sources of siege freezes/lag are gone, and the invaders should be a bit smarter with more active rams. Some new graphics tweaks, and a new song, "[https://youtu.be/dny1FMVPVk8 Nabidas]"! The problem with inter-party fighting in adventure mode on ambush is fixed.
