The '''dungeon master''' is a [[Dwarf|dwarven]] [[noble]] who can be appointed once your fortress has a [[mayor]]. They are part of the [[intrigue]] system and have been observed either recruiting [[agent]]s, or, less likely, discovering them - however, more research is needed. They have mild [[zone|room]] requirements and favor citizens with the [[Schemer]] [[skill]]. Because they do not make mandates or demands, there are no downsides to their existence and they can be appointed for the sole purpose of flavor in your fortress.

Their raws note they hold espionage and managing animals as responsibilities. In previous versions of the game, dungeon masters were responsible for taming exotic creatures, a function which in the current version is done by any dwarf with the [[animal training]] labor enabled, regardless of the fortress having a dungeon master or not. The espionage responsibility is used in the intrigue system, but has no functional use in fortress mode.

{{D for Dwarf}}
Many Dungeon masters have high Storytelling skills and possess a fondness for dragons and dice.
