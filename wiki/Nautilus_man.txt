'''Nautilus men''' are [[animal people]] variants of the common [[nautilus]] who can be found in [[savage]] [[ocean]]s. They spawn in groups of 1-3 individuals and are generally content to keep to themselves. In terms of size, they are a little over half the weight of the average [[dwarf]].

While they can learn and are able to join [[civilization]]s, they never do so, as they are completely [[aquatic]] and cannot survive on the surface.

Some dwarves [[Preferences|like]] nautilus men for their ''shells'' and their ''many tentacles''.
