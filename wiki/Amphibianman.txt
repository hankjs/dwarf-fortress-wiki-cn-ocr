'''Amphibian men''' are one of the many [[Creature|races]] of underground tribal [[creature]]s (''[[animal people]], per se, but design choices apparently voided them of that status'') found living in small groups on any [[cavern]] level. They are equivalent to [[kobold]]s in size, but are less agile.

Despite being labelled as hostile in the unit list, amphibian men initially found in the caverns will ignore your citizens unless provoked. They will usually be observed carrying wooden [[spear]]s, [[blowgun]]s and [[shield]]s, although they are sometimes seen using metal items instead. These can range from [[copper]] to [[steel]], and are presumably caused by a bug. Depending on which other subterranean creatures they have access to, their [[blowdart]]s will be covered in different [[syndrome|poisons]], which can vary from mildly annoying [[cave spider]] venom to highly [[fun|dangerous]] [[giant cave spider]] toxins. You can preemptively check for poisons by selecting a [[blowgunner]], looking in their items tab and viewing their blowdarts.

Amphibian men may launch [[ambush|group attacks]] on your fort. When this happens, all tribesmen on the map will become hostile, even if they were peaceful minutes prior to the invasion. They may arrive with [[pet]]s and [[mount]]s, some of which will be able to fly or easily catch up to your fleeing civilians. These invaders, unlike their above-ground counterparts, will not leave after some time has passed, even if your fort is completely sealed off from the caverns, nor will they prevent migrants, caravans or other invaders from arriving; including more waves of amphibian men. Because of this, several unchallenged assaults from them can quickly cause your game's FPS to drop to single-digit levels, thus making your fort completely unplayable.

Amphibian men are, as expected, amphibious. That means that they can swim through your reservoirs in order to get through your defenses, or lie in wait to ambush your [[fisherdwarf|fisherdwarves]]. Fortunately, it turns out that being in the water washes any [[blowdart]]s clean of their venom, meaning that [[blowgunner]]s that travel aquatically will have their threat level minimized. Despite their description, they do not possess the {{token|EVIL}} token and are not any more malevolent than any other race of animal people.

Some [[dwarves]] [[Preferences|like]] amphibian men for their ''terrifying features''.
