A '''guildhall''' is a [[location]] where [[dwarves]] can demonstrate [[skills]] to each other, satisfying many social [[need]]s.

Once a single profession has sufficient members (10 by default) within your fortress, they can form a [[guild]] and [[petition]] for a properly-furnished guildhall. A guildhall by default requires {{Tooltip|2,000☼|6,000☼ with hard economy}} [[room value]], and a Grand Guildhall needing {{Tooltip|10,000☼|30,000☼ with hard economy}} to be considered established; a guildhall under 2000☼ is called the Meeting Place. Both population and [[item value]] requirements can be modified in the [[Difficulty#Guilds|difficulty]] settings.

==Creation==
Guildhalls are designated from any [[meeting area]] zone. Though they are linked to [[guild]] societies, established guilds are not necessary to organize demonstrations.

Upon creation ({{menu icon|z}}->Meeting Area->[[File:Ui location add.png]] Assign Location->New Guildhall), the new guildhall will be given a random [[name]], possibly based on the relevant profession. For example, a [[ranger]]'s guildhall could be named {{dftext|"The Grove of Deer"}}. It can be renamed from the Location information screen after clicking on it in the Zone menu.  Once a guildhall is set up, you can see its [[room value]] on the locations screen, which also tells you if the guildhall is up to the desired standard - when it says '''{{dftext|Agreed to build guildhall|2:1}}''' the requirements are not yet met.

A newly created guild is set by default to allow members only, which can be changed in the set locations detail screen. The possible options are members only, citizens only, citizens and long-term residents or all visitors welcome.

==Uses==
Guildhalls provide socialization and communal skill learning via demonstrations. As long as two dwarves are idling in a guildhall, a dwarf trained in a relevant skill can demonstrate it to the other, and highly-skilled dwarves lead demonstrations more frequently - the same activity that soldiers do when [[training]] in their [[barracks]].

[[Visitors]] to your fortress can also hold demonstrations in the guildhall when the hall is set as '''{{dftext|All visitors welcome|2:1}}''' in the locations menu. This can be a nice boost to your dwarves, especially if the visitor holding the demonstration has a relevant legendary skill.

As dwarves don't normally seek out guildhalls, [[Stockpile|stockpiling]] [[alcohol]] and building [[workshops]] in a guildhall will make spending idle time more appealing and result in more demonstrations.

As even halls without established guilds will have demonstrations given to idlers, you can build halls for the professions that you need. For example, instead of waiting for weaponsmiths to [[Immigration|immigrate]], make a hall for weaponsmiths or metalworkers in general. Demonstrations will be given, unused idle hands will be trained in the professions you need, and soon enough, a guild will form.

[[Children]] can participate in guildhall demonstrations, allowing them to learn skills before they become adults. Depending on what they learn, this can provide more valuable options if they enter a [[strange mood]] beyond common [[Finished goods|crafts]].

===Thoughts===
A demonstration will satisfy the "learn something", "practice a skill" (though it does not raise their own skills), and "help somebody" [[need]]s for the [[teacher]]. [[Emotion]]ally, the participants feel interest, wonder and satisfaction for participating in a demonstration.

If a guild's petition has been accepted, but has not been built after one year, the agreement to establish a guildhall will be abandoned. Should you deny or ignore the petition, the dwarves involved will get an unhappy thought about it.

===Synergy===
A [[doctor]]'s hall can be assigned to a [[meeting area]] overlapping a zone assigned to a [[hospital]] - this has the added benefit that you will always have medically trained personnel in your hospitals, rather than having to train off of [[wound]]s.

A [[burrow]] can be designed such that any dwarf assigned to it can act as a full-time [[teacher]]. The burrow must refuse outside materials for workshops, and must not include any other meeting areas. To keep the teacher in the right place, add a [[bedroom]] and a [[dining hall]] stocked with amenities.

===Profession Guildhalls===
[[Profession]] guild halls cover generalized skill sets, though they are listed alongside the other guilds and not marked differently. These are based on the category that the skills are from. For example [[Ranger]] covers [[Ambusher]], [[Animal caretaker]], [[Animal dissector]], [[Animal trainer]], and [[Trapper]].

== World ==
Guilds, a type of [[:Category:Entities|entity]], form in [[civilization]]s that value [[Personality value#CRAFTSMANSHIP|craftmanship]] and [[Personality value#COOPERATION|cooperation]], and will build guildhalls in [[Site|cities]]. All dwarven civilizations are able to form guildhalls, as can some [[human]]s.  A guild with a guildhall was observed establishing connections with other guilds, but with an as-of-yet unknown effect.

You can visit the guildhalls of guilds in [[adventurer mode]]. E.g: In human towns, these buildings consist of three levels: The lowest, a storage level filled with bins, the second filled with chairs and tables, and the third with some chairs and tables, but mostly display furniture. Guilds will fill the display furniture with quality items of the type the guild specializes in.

[[File:Df guildhall.png|800px|thumb|center|Image of a guild hall in a human town in adventure mode. The leftmost image is the lowest storage area, the middle, the socialization area, and, at the top, an area for the display of the guild's specialty items. This being a clothier guild, they put quality clothes on display.]]

==Bugs==
*It is possible for guildhall agreements to be both satisfied and abandoned at once. This happens when some sort of work or modification is being done on the guildhall at the very moment the timer of the agreement has expired. This can also cause citizens related to that guild to have a negative and positive thought at once.
