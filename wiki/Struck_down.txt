When the message "[dwarf] has been '''struck down'''" appears, some dwarf has received an immediately fatal injury in [[combat]], namely: the [[brain]] being damaged, the [[head]] being chopped off, or the lower/upper body being cut in two. Too much of this, and your fort may experience [[tantrum spiral|large amounts of fun]].

If a dwarf is not seen dying by another dwarf, there will be, obviously, no announcement of the dwarf dying.

More specific death messages for other scenarios include the following: [[bow|shot]] [[crossbow|and]] [[magma crab|killed]], [[fire|burned]] [[magma|to]] [[fire imp|death]], [[water|drowned]], [[ice|encased in ice]], [[obsidian|encased in obsidian]], [[dragon|melted]], [[dwarven atom smasher|crushed by a drawbridge]],  [[Hell|fell into a deep chasm]], crushed by a [[cave-in]], died after colliding with an obstacle, and, most commonly among [[noble]]s, [[unfortunate accident|killed by a]] [[trap|spike]].
