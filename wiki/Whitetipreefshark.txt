'''Whitetip reef sharks''' are [[Cartilage|cartilaginous]] [[Creature#Aquatic|fish]] that can be found in [[tropical]] [[ocean]]s. At half the size of a [[dog]], they pose no threat to [[dwarves]]. As fully-sized creatures, they can't be fished by [[Fisherdwarf|fisherdwarves]], but can be caught with a [[drowning chamber]]. An infant whitetip reef shark is called a ''whitetip reef shark pup''.

Being cartilaginous, whitetip reef sharks won't give [[bone]]s if [[butcher]]ed (though they'll still provide a [[skull]]).

Some dwarves [[Preferences|like]] whitetip reef sharks for their ''distinctive dorsal fin''.
