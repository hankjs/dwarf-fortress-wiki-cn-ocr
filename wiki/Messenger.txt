'''Messengers''' are an assigned [[occupation]] at your site. They can be assigned in the Nobles and Administration menu ({{menu icon|n}}), and will act as liaisons with your [[holding]]s and conquered sites. When a messenger has been assigned, they can be sent on [[missions]] from World Screen ({{menu icon|Y}}). Click on holdings under your control to request dwarves or demand conquered sites to become [[Citizenship|citizen]]s of your fortress. Only dwarves that are considered [[historical figure]]s may be summoned to join your fortress in this way.

When appointing a messenger, citizens with high [[social skills]] are preferred, suggesting that the messenger might use these skills.
Also ambusher and observer are listed in the appointment screen for Messengers. Ambusher is possible used to move undetected to another site (to deliver a message) and observer is possible used to detect traps and enemies.
