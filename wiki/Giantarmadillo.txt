'''Giant armadillos''' are the [[giant animal]] variant of the common [[armadillo]], found in [[savage]] [[tropical]] biomes. While the common critter is roughly [[cat]]-sized, these giants are over four times the size of a [[dwarf]], though they are generally timid and will not fight back if attacked, preferring to curl up into a ball instead.

Giant armadillos can be captured in [[cage]] [[trap]]s and [[Animal trainer|trained]] into exotic [[pet]]s, possessing the default giant animal value. They provide a good amount of [[food]] and [[bone]]s when [[butcher]]ed, on top of serving as a source of [[shell]]s. Also like other giant animals, they are considered exotic mounts.

Some dwarves [[Preferences|like]] giant armadillos for their ''thick, bony armor plates''.
