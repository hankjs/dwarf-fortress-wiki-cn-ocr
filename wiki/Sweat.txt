'''Sweat''' is a type of contaminant, like [[tears]], that results from creatures undergoing intense physical activity, usually appearing when your dwarves are being trained or during combat.

Like any liquid, your adventurer can lick it to quench their thirst, but it will have little effect, and will not add to their fullness.
