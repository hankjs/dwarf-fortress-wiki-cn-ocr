'''Koala men''' are [[animal people]] variants of the common [[koala]] who can be found in [[savage]] [[temperate]] broadleaf [[forest]]s. They spawn in groups of 1-5 individuals and are generally content to keep to themselves. In terms of size, they are a little over half the weight of the average [[dwarf]].

Like other savage animal people, they can join [[civilization]]s, become [[historical figure]]s, appear as [[visitor]]s and be playable in [[adventurer mode]].

Some dwarves [[Preferences|like]] koala men for their ''adorable appearance''.

{{D for Dwarf}}

Allowing a koala man to join your fortress may cause complications, as they immediately appoint themselves [[Sheriff]] or [[Captain of the guard]] and go on the hunt for any and all crimes, no matter how small, like a violent maniac. On the plus side, your [[Bin|bins]] will always be stockpiled properly.
