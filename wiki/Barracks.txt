[[File:barracks_icon_preview.png|right]][[File:Barracks sleeping quarters.png|thumb|Squad sleeping quarters]]A '''barracks''' is a [[zone]] designated for the purpose of housing, training, supplying and otherwise servicing your [[military]]. The barracks' options define how the zone will be used by the [[squad]]s in your military. A single barracks may serve multiple squads.

== Designating ==
[[File:Granite Dojo.jpg|thumb|An over-engineered dwarven barracks]]
Barracks are defined from a [[zone]] {{Menu icon|z}}. Select Barracks, then using the zone paint feature, designate the area for the barracks. Once you've designated a barracks, you'll notice a list of the squads in your fort in the information pane. This is where you set which squad uses the barracks, and how. To do so, press {{Menu icon|z}} and select the barracks zone, then select the barracks add squad button ([[File:Ui assign squad.jpg|28px]]), then select the relevant activity for each squad assigned to the barracks:

* '''Sleep''' - assigned squads will be housed here, requiring that enough beds be placed in the barracks (one for each squad member).
* '''Training''' - assigned squads will [[training|train]] here. Note that [[marksdwarves]] assigned to the barracks will train in melee, including [[Combat_skill#Equipment_skills|hammering]], to train their ranged skill, they require an [[Archery target|archery range]] instead.
* '''Individual Eq''' and '''Squad Eq''' - Each dwarf in a squad will use a separate container (such as a [[chest]], [[cabinet]] or [[armor stand]]) placed in the barracks to store their equipment.  As you place them, they will be automatically assigned to each dwarf.

==Location==
The location of your barracks is a matter of great importance - they may often be the location where your military dwarves will be training, sleeping, or otherwise performing activities. It is important to consider where you expect your enemies ([[goblin]]s, [[forgotten beast]]s, [[titan]]s, etc.) to attack, such as entrances or focal points of your fortress. You may want to build your barracks relatively close to or just outside of high-traffic areas, main entrances to your fortress, or chambers with [[trap]]s in them. Planning ahead will allow you to react quicker to an invasion by hostile creatures and save more civilians in the process.

== Notes ==
* Note that if a squad is [[Schedule|scheduled]] to train, but lacking an assigned barracks, a dwarf's job will be marked as {{DFtext|Soldier (no activity)|6:0:0}}, leaving the squad with nothing to do.
* Civilians will not sleep in open beds within a defined barracks.

==Bugs==
* Barracks will not store equipment.{{bug|1445}}
