{{For/see|the tree|[[Ash (tree)]]}}

'''Ash''' is an intermediate good used to make [[potash]], [[lye]], or to [[Glazer|glaze]] [[ceramic industry|ceramics]]. Ash is produced by burning [[wood]] at a [[wood furnace]], and comes in [[bar]]s, stored in a [[Stockpile#Bar/Block|bar/block stockpile]], and viewable in the [[stocks]] screen under "bars". Unlike other bars, an ash bar is not a valid construction material. 

Procedurally-generated creatures (such as [[titan]]s and [[forgotten beast]]s) may occasionally be composed of ash, though killing them will just result in a useless pile of ash for your dwarves to clean up.  A killed [[fire man]] will leave behind a usable bar of ash, though these creatures are rare.

Ash is one of the [[Hardcoded_material|hardcoded materials]].
