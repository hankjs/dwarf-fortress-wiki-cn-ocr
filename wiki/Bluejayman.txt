'''Bluejay men''' are [[animal people]] variants of the common [[blue jay]] who inhabit a number of [[temperate]] [[biome]]s. They spawn in groups of anywhere between 5-10 individuals and are generally content to keep to themselves. In terms of size, they are a little over half the weight of the average [[dwarf]]. All bluejay men are born with Legendary [[skill]] in [[Climber|climbing]]. Bluejay men will generally not attack your dwarves, but can cancel work orders.

Like other savage animal people, bluejay men can join [[civilization]]s, become [[historical figure]]s, appear as [[visitor]]s and be playable in [[adventurer mode]].

Some dwarves [[Preferences|like]] bluejay men for their ''coloration''.

{{D for Dwarf}}

Bluejay men are often seen befriending [[Raccoon man|raccoon men]] and [[yeti]]s, while having a troubled relationship with overweight [[goblin]]s and [[ghost]]s.

Some Bluejay men have been observed hitting balls with clubs over great distances.
