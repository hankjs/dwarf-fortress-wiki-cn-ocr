The '''siege workshop''' is used to make [[ballista]] and [[catapult]] parts, as well as to assemble siege ammunition (namely, [[ballista arrow]]s).

A dwarf must have the [[siege engineer]] [[labor]] enabled in order to use a siege [[workshop]]. [[Siege engineer]]s can also assemble [[ballista]] and [[catapult]] parts into stationary [[siege engine]]s to be loaded and fired by [[siege operator]]s.
