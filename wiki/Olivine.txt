'''Olivine''' is one of many low-[[value]] minerals that are [[magma-safe]], and can be used for floodgates and mechanisms used for the controlling of magma. It is also one of the few minerals that may contain veins of [[native platinum]] (the other being [[magnetite]]).

Items built using olivine will be yellow-green (or dark green in ASCII mode).

==In real life==
Olivine is a magnesium iron silicate mineral with the chemical formula (Mg,Fe)<sub>2</sub>SiO<sub>4</sub>.
It is defined by its bright green color. Gem-quality examples of the mineral are called [[peridot]].

It is also the most common rock in the world, taking up an estimated 80% of the world's volume, of course most of this is in the mantle 7km underground in the sea and an average 35km beneath the continent, most frequently as an olivine-rich ultramafic rock known as peridotite.
