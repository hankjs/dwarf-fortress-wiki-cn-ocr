'''Goats''' are small, [[milk]]-bearing [[domestic animal]]s. Their small stature means they will not yield much [[meat]], but they require as little [[pasture]] as [[sheep]] and are a good choice for starting a [[cheese]] industry. Males are called ''billy goats'', females are ''nanny goats'' and the young are called ''goat kids''.

They should not be confused with the similarly named [[mountain goat]], which is a completely different and non-domestic species.

Some dwarves [[Preferences|like]] goats for their ''eating habits''.

{{d for dwarf}}

Some humans have a strange desire to simulate the feeling of existing as a goat.
