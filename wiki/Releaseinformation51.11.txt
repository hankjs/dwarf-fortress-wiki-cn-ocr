Hey everyone!

Alexandra here with a bit of community news and patch 51.11. In the patch, we fixed some lost information when people leave and when they arrive. We also turned off the broken underground invasions until we fix them with the siege update and a bunch of ice related bugs that have been around for years. There’s also some new graphics going in for divine/artifact weapon tiles and the leather/metal caps in the portraits which you can see [https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/975370/view/547858640693887535 here].

=== Happy Birthday Tarn! ===
We wanted to wish Tarn a belated Happy Birthday, which was on April 17th. We got together at Kitfox and made a card for him with our artistic interpretation of “Toady One” in honour of the day. You also might have noticed the preview of animal people clothing in portraits! The art is now done but it’s going to take a while to get every single portrait into the game. We are pretty busy with siege-related stuff right now but you’ll see the new art in a future update.

=== 1,000,000 Copies Sold! ===
And more good news: Last week we officially surpassed 1 million copies sold on Steam. This number represents countless dwarves, trials and tribulations from your generated worlds. Dwarf Fortress wouldn’t be the game it is today without the stories you bring to life in these worlds. So thank you from the entire team for supporting us throughout the years. If you haven’t already, consider sharing your story in a Steam review.

=== Dwarf Fortress Documentary ===
Over the past three years, the video game documentarians at NoClip have been working on a Dwarf Fortress series. It covers everything from Tarn and Zach’s early days all the way to post-Adventure Mode launch on Steam. We think they did a great job of sharing such an incredible dev story. All four parts of the documentary are now available on [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwLSgaYPKA0&list=PL-THgg8QnvU5xvhtFe7orgcnfIqFq_qVk Youtube].

See you in the next patch,
