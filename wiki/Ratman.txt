'''Rat men''' are humanoid versions of the common [[rat]] and a [[Creature|species]] of unremarkable [[animal people]], found in most [[savage]] [[biome]]s. They are about half the size of the average [[dwarf]] when adults and spawn in groups of 5-10 individuals, and are unlikely to pose any danger to your fortress unless provoked. They are a completely different race from the [[rodent man]].

Like other savage animal people, rat men may occasionally join [[civilization]]s, becoming full-fledged citizens who may appear in your fortress as [[visitor]]s or be playable in [[adventurer mode]].

Some dwarves [[Preferences|like]] rat men for their ''friendliness'', their ''playfulness'', their ''curiosity'', and their ''intelligence''.

Rat men myths speak of a green glowing mineral known only as "warpstone" that was forged into a legendary Warhammer.

<!-- Reference: "Splinter" character from Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles -->
Contrary to widespread rumors, rat men are not known to tame or train turtle men.
