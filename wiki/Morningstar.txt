[[File:morningstar_sprite_preview.png|right]]A '''morningstar''' is an [[attack types|edged]] [[weapon]] that consists of a spiked ball mounted on the end of a handle. Despite similarities to a [[mace]] in appearance, a morningstar's size and contact area are closer to those of a [[war hammer]]. Specifically, a morningstar is 25% larger than a war hammer with the same contact area, and uses [[attack types|piercing]] damage to inflict internal injuries.  

Morningstars use and train the [[macedwarf]] skill. As foreign weapons, dwarves cannot [[forge]] morningstars, limiting supply to whatever low-[[quality]] specimens can be traded from human [[caravan]]s and scavenged from invaders. All dwarves can equip morningstars, though [[Weapon#Size|a tiny fraction must use two hands]].
