<div id="test" style="margin-right:10px;">[[File:missing_features_preview.png|right]]</div>This page lists the '''missing features''' of DF version 50, which were present in 0.47. Some of those don't have an alternative yet and are not implemented, which is what this list is about. This list is a work in progress as many discussions are scattered between multiple platforms and new issues are being discovered daily. Some of these were removed due to time constraints and are intended to be brought back in the future. {{cite forum|169696.msg8442542#msg8442542}}

==Missing gameplay features==
*Locations can't be disbanded once they have been created. [[DFHack]] fixes this.
*Workshops can't be restricted to a certain skill level or labor ([[DF2014:Manager#Workshop_profiles|Workshop profiles]]). [[DFHack]] fixes this.
*Labor priorities are not available (aside from prioritizing certain tiles when [[mining]] or [[smoothing]]). [[DFHack]] fixes this.
*No mass designation of buildings to mark them as to be removed. [[DFHack]] fixes this.
*No mass removal of building foundations (as in the foundations which are created after placing a building). [[DFHack]] fixes this.
*Burrows are only designatable on a layer-by-layer basis. Painting over multiple layers only saves the one you first clicked. [[DFHack]] fixes this.
*Specific mechanisms aren't selectable when linking levers to objects, you need to forbid every other mechanism through the stock screen to have the autoselect choose the one you want. [[DFHack]] fixes this.
*[[Civilian alert]]s are not available. [[DFHack]] fixes this.
*Characters cited among your dwarves' relationships cannot be examined if they're not on the map (i.e. [[deity|gods]]).
*Worldgen cannot be aborted once it has reached the desired history length.
*Can't mass bury dwarves in the same room in multiple coffins. (can't select a coffin to be used for burial, that functionality has been moved to a tomb zone requiring multiple tombs for multiple dwarves). [[DFHack]] fixes this.

==Missing UI features==
*Logs aren't accessible after closing them. There is no combat log available when clicking a creature. [[DFHack]] fixes this.
*No [[health screen]] with an overview of dwarf and livestock health.
*[[Notes]] cannot be created. As an alternative, most buildings, zones, and stockpiles can be renamed. [[DFHack]] fixes this.
*There is no UI to visualize [[trade depot]] accessibility. [[DFHack]] fixes this.

==Other missing features==
*[[Camp]]s cannot be built in [[Adventure mode]]
*[[Site]]s cannot be founded in [[Adventure mode]]
*The map cannot be viewed in [[Legends]] mode. This also leaves Civilizations without icons.
*[[DF2014:Legends#Exporting_World_information|Legends export]] can only produce the XML file, not any of the other files it used to.
*[[World painter]] is absent.
*[[DF2014:Technical_tricks#Video_Card_Options|PRINT_MODE:TEXT]] is no longer an option.

==Reintroduced features==
* [[Arena mode]] was reintroduced in [[Release information/50.06|50.06]].
* Exporting [[Legends]] content as XML was reintroduced in [[Release information/50.08|50.08]]
* [[Adventure mode]] was reintroduced in [[Release information/51.02|51.02]].
