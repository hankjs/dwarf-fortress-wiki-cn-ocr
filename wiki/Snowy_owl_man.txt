'''Snowy owl men''' are [[animal people]] variants of the common [[snowy owl]] who inhabit [[savage]] [[tundra]]s. They spawn in groups of anywhere between 1-5 individuals and are generally content to keep to themselves. In terms of size, they are a little over half the weight of the average [[dwarf]]. All snowy owl men are born with Legendary [[skill]] in [[Climber|climbing]].

Like other savage animal people, snowy owl men can join [[civilization]]s, become [[historical figure]]s, appear as [[visitor]]s and be playable in [[adventurer mode]].

Some dwarves [[Preferences|like]] snowy owl men for their ''coloration'' and their ''yellow eyes''.
