'''Cabinets''' are a type of [[furniture]] used for storing [[clothes]]. They are a common requirement for [[noble]]s and they are also good for increasing the [[Zone#Quality_and_value|value of a room]]. A cabinet can hold close to 20 pieces of clothing. Cabinets do not block movement; dwarves and other creatures are able to walk through tiles with cabinets.

If a dwarf does not own a cabinet in their bedroom, they will leave their clothing on the floor.

Cabinets can be made from [[wood]], [[stone]], [[glass]], and all ordinary types of [[metal]] except [[pig iron]] and [[bismuth]].
