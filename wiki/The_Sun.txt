{{D for Dwarf}}

The '''Sun''' is a floating ball of [[fire|flame]] that comes out during the day.  It is spherical, luminous, and travels through the sky starting every dawn, for reasons no one knows.  The sun makes things bright and hot and can be considered a menace, but while the sun is [[Cave adaptation|not a friend]] to [[dwarves]], it is nonetheless the enemy of things [[Bogeyman|far scarier]].

The [[Above_ground|light of the sun]] is required for the [[farming]] of surface [[plants]] such as [[Sun berry|sun berries.]]  Dwarves who spend too much time in the sun will get used to it and start living on the dirt like the [[elf|smelly hippies]].  True dwarves avoid the sun if they can, since [[Cave adaptation|exposure to the harsh rays]] can cause awful [[vomit|vomiting]] to one who rightly embraces the [[stone]].

[[Engraver]]s often create pictures of the sun for a variety of reasons.  The Sun can be useful for telling time; in fact, most days begin at "sunrise" and end at "sunset," after which night begins.

One day, the Dwarves will succeed in surrounding the sun with [[Gem window|gemstone windows]] before learning to weaponize it. The [[Calendar#Ages|Age of Dwarves]] will soon follow.
