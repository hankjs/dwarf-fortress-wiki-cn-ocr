'''Bookcases''' are [[furniture]] used in [[library|libraries]] to store written [[book]]s. They are built using {{Menu icon|b|f|o|sep=+}}.

Bookcases can be crafted from 1 log in the [[carpenter's workshop]], 2 bars in the [[metalsmith's forge]], 1 bag of [[sand]] in the [[glass furnace]], or 1 stone in the [[stoneworker's workshop]]. Bookcases are stockpiled in furniture stockpiles under "Other Large Tools".

It is not easy to find how many books a bookcase will hold (codices do not have a fixed size). A bookcase should be capable of between 200 and 500 codices, so not many bookcases are needed for small libraries. A single bookcase can hold 500 scrolls or 1,000 quires.
