'''Clear zircons''' are semi-precious [[gems]] found in small clusters in all [[igneous]] and [[metamorphic]] stone layers. At 25, it has the highest [[material value]] of any type of zircon - all types of colored zircon, while still semi-precious, have a material value of only 20.

==In real life==
In real life, high-quality colorless zircon is commonly used to make imitation [[diamond]]s. Its higher value may be intended to reflect this.
