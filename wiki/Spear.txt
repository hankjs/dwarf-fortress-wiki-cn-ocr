:''For a comparison of different weapons, see [[Weapon]].''

[[File:spear_sprite_preview.png|right]]A '''spear''' is a piercing [[weapon]] that is essentially a sharply pointed blade mounted on the end of a long handle. Spears are half the size of [[pike (weapon)|pikes]], but only suffer a 17% decrease in penetration. 

Spears use and train the [[speardwarf]] skill. Dwarves can [[forge]] spears out of any weapon-grade [[metal]] but those with [[material science|superior edge properties]] are more effective. For the purposes of building a realistic [[danger room]], less lethal wooden spears may be used if purchased from elves first. All dwarves can equip spears, but [[Weapon#Size|some must use two hands]].

Spears may also be installed in [[trap#Upright Spear/Spike|upright spear traps]], allowing them to be mechanically operated; this is particularly useful for constructing [[danger room]]s.

== Forging and melting ==
* Metal spears cost '''one''' [[metal]] bar to [[forge]], or '''three''' [[adamantine]] wafers.
* When a non-adamantine metal spear is [[melt|melted down]], it will return '''0.9''' metal bars, for an '''efficiency of 90%'''.
* When an adamantine spear is melted down, it will produce '''0.9''' wafers, for an '''efficiency of 30%'''
