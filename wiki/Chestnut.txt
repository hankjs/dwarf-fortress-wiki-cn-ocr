'''Chestnuts''' are a type of [[tree]] found in dry areas of [[biome|temperate forests]]. Like the overwhelming majority of overland trees, chestnut [[carpenter|wood]] is brown and produces brown products. 

Chestnut trees produce '''Chestnut leaves''' and '''Chestnut burrs''', which — together with logs — can be used in a [[dyer's shop]] to make dark brown [[dye]].

Some [[Dwarf|dwarves]] [[Preferences|like]] chestnuts for their ''spiny pods'', their ''smelly catkins'', their ''chestnuts'' and their ''autumn coloration''. So yes, you can have a dwarf who redundantly "likes chestnuts for their chestnuts".
