'''Mountain goat men''' are humanoid versions of the common [[mountain goat]] and a [[Creature|species]] of unremarkable [[animal people]], found in [[savage]] [[mountain]]s. They are as heavy as [[dwarf|dwarves]] when adults and spawn in groups of 1-5 individuals, who should pose no threat to dwarves unless provoked.

Like other savage animal people, mountain goat men may occasionally join [[civilization]]s, becoming full-fledged citizens who may appear in your fortress as [[visitor]]s or be playable in [[adventurer mode]]. Mountain goat men are able to wear dwarf-sized armor and clothing, making it a good choice for then to start in a dwarven civilization.

Some dwarves [[Preferences|like]] mountain goat men for their ''beards'', their ''long horns'' and their ''surefootedness''.

{{D for Dwarf}}

The most remarkable thing about a mountain goat man standing in the doorway, is that it's a mountain goat man, and that it's standing in the doorway.
