'''Copperhead snake men''' are [[animal people]] variants of the common [[copperhead snake]] who can be found in some [[savage]] [[temperate]] regions. They spawn in groups of 1-3 individuals and possess their animal cousins' venomous [[syndrome]], which causes nausea, pain and swelling on the victim, which is inconvenient but not fatal in most cases. In terms of size, they are a little over half the weight of the average [[dwarf]].

Like other savage animal people, they can join [[civilization]]s, become [[historical figure]]s, appear as [[visitor]]s and be playable in [[adventurer mode]].

Some dwarves [[Preferences|like]] copperhead snake men for their ''attractive scale patterns''.
