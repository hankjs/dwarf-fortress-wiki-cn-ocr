'''Cyclopes''' are a [[Creature|species]] of large, intelligent, single-eyed [[semi-megabeast]]s. They inhabit [[cave]]s, and may attack your fortress once it reaches a certain amount of [[wealth]]. 

When assaulting a fort, cyclopes will [[Building destroyer|destroy buildings]] and pummel any [[dwarf|dwarven]] civilian unlucky enough to get in their path into mush. Their only weapon is their brute strength, as they possess no natural combat skills and lack the immunity to stunning possessed by the equally-large [[ettin]], with a well-trained [[military]] easily being able to knock a cyclops down and cause it to give in to pain before it can retaliate. They should not be underestimated, however, as they will easily tear their way through unskilled recruits.

Despite their huge size, cyclopes can be easily captured by a [[cage]] [[trap]]; however, due to the weight of the cyclops, your dwarves will [[haul]] the cage very slowly. While quite harmless inside a cage, a cyclops can prove extremely [[fun]] if released inside your fortress. Since they are intelligent, dwarves will not [[Animal trainer|train]] or [[butcher]] them, limiting their use to [[live training]] or decorating the fort by placing them somewhere to your liking.

Beware of cyclopes and other [[semi-megabeast]]s who have actually managed to substantially increase their skills, which, by the way, is something no [[megabeast]] is able to do.

Some dwarves [[Preferences|like]] cyclops for their ''single eye''.

<!-- Reference: ??? -->
*They are incredibly skilled at military stratagems and tactical planning, able to lead several [[dwarf|dwarve]]s and war [[jabberer]]s into battle against invaders.

<!-- Reference: Marvel Comics 'X-Men' franchise  -->
*They are commonly found teamed up with [[Wolverine man|wolverine men]]. They do not, however, fire laser beams with their eyes.

<!-- Reference: Classical Mythology, specifically 'The Odyssey' -->
*They do not herd [[sheep]] and will not steal them from your fort (''nor do they have [[cheese making]] skill'').  Their eye is particularly vulnerable to wooden !![[menacing spike]]s!!, [[ballista]] bolts, and [[pike (weapon)|pikes]]. Furthermore, do NOT attempt to escape a cyclops by claiming your name is "Nobody". Doesn't work anymore. They know their history.
