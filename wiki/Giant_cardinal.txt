'''Giant cardinals''' are [[giant animal]] variants of the common [[cardinal]], found in a number of [[savage]] [[temperate]] [[biome]]s. They spawn in flocks of anywhere between 5 and 10 individuals. Being three times the size of the average [[dwarf]], these birds may pose a threat if provoked, but will generally leave a fortress alone save for potential job cancellations or scaring livestock out of [[pasture]]s.

Giant cardinals can be captured in [[cage]] [[trap]]s and [[Animal trainer|trained]] into exotic [[pet]]s, possessing the default giant animal value. They give a decent amount of returns when [[butcher]]ed, and can be placed in a [[nest box]] for a meager amount of [[egg]]s, though they fail to produce as much as your common poultry. Like all giant animals, they are considered exotic [[mount]]s.

Some dwarves [[Preference|like]] giant cardinals for their ''coloration''.
