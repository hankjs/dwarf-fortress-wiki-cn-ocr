'''Wild boars''' are [[creature]]s found in various types of [[biome]]s, appearing in groups of 5-10 individuals. While they're larger than [[Dwarf|dwarves]] and possess a nasty reputation in real life of being aggressive and dangerous, wild boars in-game are benign meanderers who'll rather flee from dwarves than fight back against their attempts to hunt them. Males of the species are simply called ''wild boars'', while females are ''wild boar sows'' and their young are ''wild boar piglets''.

Wild boars can be captured in [[cage]] [[trap]]s and [[Animal trainer|trained]] into exotic [[pet]]s. Compared to their domesticated [[pig]] cousins, wild boars provide more returns when [[butcher]]ed but can't be [[milk]]ed, and as they appear in large groups, many can be captured or hunted quickly to help fuel a [[meat industry]]. Wild boars are also a good source of [[ivory]], which normal pigs don't produce.

Some dwarves [[Preferences|like]] wild boars for their ''tusks'' and their ''ferocious charges''.
