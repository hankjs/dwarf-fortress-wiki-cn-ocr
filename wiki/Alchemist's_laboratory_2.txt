In very old versions of ''Dwarf Fortress'', an '''alchemist's laboratory''' was a [[workshop]] used to make bars of [[soap]] (then a simple [[caravan|trade good]]) from [[lye]] and [[tallow]]. To build an alchemist's laboratory, you had to have three clear [[glass]] [[vial]]s. The workshop's function was taken over by the dedicated [[soap maker's workshop]] in version 0.31.01, and the workshop, the [[alchemist|skill]], and the [[alchemy|labor]] were buried from view in the game files. [[Main:Toady One|Toady One]] [http://www.bay12games.com/media/df_talk_8_transcript.html plans to eventually return] the workshop to the game in a different form, but for now the alchemist's laboratory languishes in the game's code graveyard.
