'''Glazer''' is the skill associated with the glazing [[labor]]. Glazers apply [[glaze]] to [[ceramic]] and [[stone]] [[Storage|containers]], [[statue]]s, and [[finished goods|craft items]] at the [[kiln]] or [[magma kiln]]. Glazer [[skill|skill level]] determines the quality of the glaze, as well as presumably the speed at which the labor is completed.

Glazers can make [[earthenware]] ceramics [[Material definition token#ABSORPTION|watertight]] to use in storing liquids for a fortress as part of the [[ceramic industry]].

Unfortunately, [[soft wheat|soft wheat flour]] and [[egg|chicken egg]] [[cook|biscuits]] cannot be glazed with [[dwarven sugar]] to produce glazed doughnuts.
