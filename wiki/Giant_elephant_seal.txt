'''Giant elephant seals''' are larger than young [[dragon]]s and mature much more quickly. Because of their size they will brutally murder anything that provokes them, making them a great addition to your fort's defense. Giant elephant seals can be [[animal trainer|tamed]] and kept as [[pet]]s, but their real value lies in their [[butcher]]ing returns. By breeding giant elephant seals, your [[meat industry]] can sustain your entire fortress with food to spare. Note, however, that it takes five years for giant elephant seal pups to reach full adult size.

Unlike most animals, there is a significant size difference between the sexes of giant elephant seals. Males grow to more than three times the size of females, resulting in large variances in butchering returns.

Some dwarves [[preference|admire]] giant elephant seals for their ''large floppy noses'' and their ''great size''.
