'''Marlins''' are a species of large [[Creature|fish]] who can be found in [[temperate]] and [[tropical]] [[ocean]]s. They are quite large, over 13 times heavier than a [[dwarf]], and as such provide a great amount of returns when [[butcher]]ed. As non-[[vermin]] fish, marlins can't be fished by [[Fisherdwarf|fisherdwarves]], but can be caught with the use of a [[drowning chamber]]. Infant marlins are called ''marlin fry''.

Some dwarves [[Preferences|like]] marlins for their ''sharp snout''.
