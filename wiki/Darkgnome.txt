'''Dark gnomes''' are small humanoid [[creature]]s who inhabit [[evil]] [[mountain]]s. Their intelligence is on par with [[dwarf|dwarves]] and other sentient creatures, but they lack the ability to communicate verbally, one possible reason they haven't formed a [[civilization|civilized society]]. They have teal skin, yellow eyes and a wonderful variety of [[beard]]s. They're a rather long-lived race, with the oldest ones living up to 250 years. In [[adventurer mode]], they're only active during the night.

If you leave [[alcohol|booze]] out in the open, they'll come in groups of five to ten to drink it all and scare the poop out of any civilians they encounter. If they reach your alcohol, they'll guzzle it with such efficient speed that your dwarves will soon be dying of thirst unless you have steady access to [[plants]] or [[water]]. They are even capable of stealing alcohol directly from your dwarves: If, say, an axedwarf is busy fighting a [[goblin]] <strike>liberator</strike> child-snatcher, the dark gnome will walk right up and drink their personal supply of booze (if they have one). They have even been seen swarming [[caravan]]s and chugging booze between getting hacked to bits by the caravan guards.  

Despite their apparent malice, dark gnomes are not particularly violent and will run in terror when chased. They're able to equip [[weapon]]s and [[armor]] that are appropriately sized for them, but this is rarely seen.  Any [[dwarf]] or [[dog]] can easily hurt them, but be wary of [[combat|fighting]] on [[mountain|mountainsides]], where a dwarf may charge the gnome, miss, and [[gravity|fall a very long distance]]. [[Gnomeblight]] is extremely toxic to dark gnomes, causing necrosis if somehow applied to them. 

Their [[good]] counterparts are the [[mountain gnome]]s.

Some dwarves [[Preferences|like]] dark gnomes for their ''ability to hold liquor''. They have an inebriation dilution factor of 500, allowing them to drink more than creatures ten times their size.
