'''Thrower''' is the [[combat skill]] associated with throwing objects at [[creature]]s with the intent of killing them. Higher skill determines the accuracy and damage of thrown objects. Note that any object can and will cause serious damage when thrown, including [[clothing|socks]], [[large roach|roaches]], and even [[water]]. Thrower is not to be confused with the Misc. Object User skill, which is about using non-weapon objects in melee combat.

== Throwing in fortress mode ==
In fortress mode, a dwarf who is [[tantrum]]ing may pick up and throw an object.  Doing so gives the dwarf experience towards throwing.  Otherwise, dwarves will never use throwing in fortress mode.

== Throwing in adventure mode ==

In adventure mode, throwing is an excellent way to roll the dice before close combat, essentially giving the chance for the opponent's vital organs or extremities to be damaged (plus any bonus that may come with the damage - for example, sightless monsters or weaponless guards). Furthermore, '''anything''' can be used as a weapon - [[Soil|silt]], [[pebbles]], [[vomit]] (and other [[liquid]]s) and [[Adventure mode quick reference|throwable small creatures]] have been witnessed colliding with opponents, with devastating results (two or three handfuls of dirt can take down a wolf, for example).

At the moment, an excellent way to level up the throwing skill is to collect many items, or a huge stack of coins, and throw them directly under you. This, combined with an endless supply of vomit, soil, or small rocks, can increase your warrior's attributes and their throwing skill to Legendary in about ten minutes. It is unknown whether this will be tweaked in coming releases. Interactions that use the effect {{token|MATERIAL_EMISSION|in}} will train the thrower and [[archer]] skills, so spitting in adventure mode may be used to train as well.

Another amusing throwing bug is that throwing is not proportionate to adventurer strength - a human throwing a dragon corpse a few tiles is perfectly possible, although it may or may not be as efficient as just throwing a weapon.

Most thrown things will do bludgeoning damage, however, some other kinds of items do different kinds of damage; although not as effective as using a [[bow]]/[[crossbow]], [[arrow]]s and [[bolt]]s can be thrown and they will do piercing damage (and, as an added bonus, the ammunition can be picked up afterwards).  Swords and axes can do slashing damage, but the attack type is randomized (ie, your adventurer may end up hitting with a pommel strike). At high levels of thrower, gold and silver coins can be used to devastating effect against unarmored opponents, often chipping or fracturing bones. Given their light weight and ubiquity, they provide a reliable source of ammunition to cripple an opponent before the fighting begins. There is even a report that throwing a [[fluffy wambler]] can do significant damage, as seen here:
