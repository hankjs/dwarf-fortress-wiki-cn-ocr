'''Fire-safe materials''' are those that are not damaged by [[fire]]. These materials include [[glass]], ''most'' (but not all!) [[stone]], and ''most'' [[metal]] (everything ''but'' [[bismuth]], [[lead]], [[tin]], [[zinc]], and all three pewters). [[Nether-cap]] is the only [[wood]] that can withstand fire (and even [[magma]]) thanks to its fixed temperature, but the game does not recognize it as a fire-safe building material. Counterintuitively, [[Bituminous coal]], [[lignite]], [[charcoal]], and [[coke]] '''are''' considered fire-safe, since they only catch fire when they're hot enough (see below).

For the purpose of job item requirements (e.g. in custom [[reaction]]s or when constructing certain buildings), only [[bar]]s, [[block]]s, [[stone]], [[log]]s, and [[anvil]]s can be classified as "fire-safe materials" - all other item types are rejected outright. Fire-safe materials are only required when the object is going to come into contact with extreme heat, such as all conventional [[furnace]]s and the [[metalsmith's forge|forge]]. For the magma-powered versions of these buildings, as well as anything that will be in direct contact with magma (such as [[floodgate]]s,  [[grate]]s or [[pump]]s, but not constructed walls, floors, fortifications, etc.), fire-safe is not enough: it has to be [[magma-safe|<u>magma</u>-safe]].

As far as the game is concerned, only materials which are stable at the [[temperature]] {{ct|11000}} (i.e. MELTING_POINT/BOILING_POINT/IGNITE_POINT/HEATDAM_POINT greater than 11000 and COLDDAM_POINT less than 11000) are considered fire-safe.  Despite this temperature being considered fire-safe, actual [[fire]] can generate temperatures significantly higher - in particular, all burning items generate temperatures up to 200 degrees ''above'' their material's ignite point, so once a "fire-safe" item manages to get ignited (e.g. by exposure to [[magma]]), it can easily spread further. For practical purposes, anything which has an IGNITE_POINT should be treated as not fire-safe.
