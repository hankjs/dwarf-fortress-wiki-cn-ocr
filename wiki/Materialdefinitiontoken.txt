The following [[token]]s can be used in creating new [[:Category:material template raw pages|material templates]], as well as in [[material]] definitions (whether for inorganics or those within plants and creatures).

Material templates are used to define broad classes of materials (eg. "stone", or "milk"), the properties of which can be imported into other more specific material definitions (eg. "granite", or "llama milk") using the <code>[USE_MATERIAL_TEMPLATE:template_name]</code> token.  When creating material templates, the <code>[OBJECT:MATERIAL_TEMPLATE]</code> [[token]] begins the definition of a material template [[raw file]].  Following this, each new material template definition begins with the <code>[MATERIAL_TEMPLATE:template_name]</code> token, where <code>template_name</code> is a unique identifier for the template, and that material's properties are then defined using the tokens listed below.

|-
| {{text_anchor|USE_MATERIAL_TEMPLATE}}
|
* <template name>
| Resets all material tokens back to their default values, then imports the tokens of the specified preexisting material template (overriding any tokens defined prior to itself in the material). This means USE_MATERIAL_TEMPLATE should be the first token present in any material using it. It cannot be used inside of a [MATERIAL_TEMPLATE:X] which prevents the creation of nested material template structures.

|-
