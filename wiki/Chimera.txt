'''Chimeras''' are [[fanciful]] [[creature]]s which are merely the stuff of [[legends]]. They do not actually exist, appearing only in [[engraving]]s as the fancy of artists.

Some [[Dwarf|dwarves]] [[Preferences|like]] chimeras for their ''terrifying features''.

{{D for Dwarf}}
Chimeras are known for their uncanny ability to write stories that are intentionally poor to the point of humor. Their most famous works speak of warriors fighting the [[Hidden Fun Stuff]] and of researchers recovering unusual forms of smelted [[pitchblende]].
