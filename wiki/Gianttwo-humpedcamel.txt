'''Giant two-humped camels''' are massive counterparts of the common [[two-humped camel]] who inhabit [[savage]] [[desert]]s, spawning in groups of 3-7 individuals. They are 8 times bigger than their normal versions and about 67 times heavier than a [[dwarf]], making them one of the largest herbivores in savage environments. Despite this great size, however, they are benign and will normally flee from dwarves rather than fight them. Watch out for the rare case of them being enraged in combat, however, as it may lead to your hunters being quickly trampled to death, and particularly make sure not to [[Creature#Agitation|agitate]] your embark's giant camels.

Giant two-humped camels can be captured in [[cage]] [[trap]]s and [[Animal trainer|trained]] into [[pet]]s, possessing identical pet value to a normal camel. Because of their immense size, they require a very large [[pasture]] to survive, but also grant a spectacular amount of returns if [[butcher]]ed, and like normal two-humped camels, their females can be [[milk]]ed, which can be used for [[cook]]ing or to produce [[cheese]]. Note, however, that giant camel milk is identical to normal-sized camel milk in every aspect. They are exotic mounts, and so may be used by [[Elf|elves]] during [[siege]]s.

Some dwarves [[Preferences|like]] giant two-humped camels for their ''humps''.
