A '''bin''' is a specially made basket for certain [[stockpile]]s. A bin can be made from one [[wood|wooden log]] at a [[carpenter's workshop]] or forged from 3 [[metal]] [[bar]]s at a [[forge]]. Bins make it possible to store lots of objects into one tile of a stockpile. A stockpile without a bin will likely fill up fast, leaving any remaining items where they are to get in the way. Graphically, when a bin is empty, the sprite will be that of an empty bin with no lid, whereas a bin with multiple types of items will have a lid, albeit slightly tilted. Bins are a component in building a [[bolt thrower]]. Bins that are filled with a specific type of item will show those items sticking out the top of the bin:
<div style="testA" style="margin-top: 10px; margin-left: 20px;">[[File:bins_variants_preview.png]]</div>

Bins are therefore incredibly useful to a maturing fortress. The best material for bins is generally [[wood]], because wooden bins are the lightest bins and will therefore save your haulers' time. Of course, if you intend to use bins next to a [[volcano]] or something equally [[fire|hot]], you may want to use metal bins. 

If your fort suffers from a lack of wood but [[Fuel|charcoal]] is also your only [[fuel]] source, producing metal instead of wooden bins will actually '''increase''' your wood consumption. Forging each bin will cost one unit of fuel and smelting the metal bars will also require fuel. Charcoal is produced at a rate of one bar per log. You can only reduce wood consumption by making metal bins if you use coke or [[magma]] to heat your smelters and forges.

Stockpiles that use bins are [[ammunition|ammo]], [[armor]], [[bar]]s/[[block]]s, [[cloth]], [[Currency|coins]], [[finished goods]], [[gems]], [[leather]] and [[weapon]]s. [[Food]] stockpiles use [[barrel]]s and [[large pot]]s instead of bins. Other stockpiles do not use anything at all.

Bins are a fast way to transport trade goods to a [[trade depot]]. Instead of carrying the individual item, the dwarf will haul the whole container for trade. Though if the contents inside are heavy, it will still take a long time.

For information on managing bins in stockpiles, see [[using bins and barrels]].

[[Melt item|Melting]] metal bins return a single bar.

== Bugs ==
* Hauling jobs block access to all the items in the destination containers until the hauling is complete. This often results in cancellation spam and work delays.{{bug|9004}} One workaround is creating a "feeder stockpile" with containers disabled.
* Items in bins are sometimes not found for tasks.{{bug|8755}}
