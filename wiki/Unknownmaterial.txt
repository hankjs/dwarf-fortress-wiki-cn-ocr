'''Unknown materials''' can appear as a [[Hardcoded material|placeholder]] as the result of [[bug]]s - specifically, missing [[material token]]s. They have minimal material properties, typically appearing as a light gray solid unaffected by [[temperature]].

An "Unknown material", as it is listed in [[building]] descriptions, normally has no name. It has an internal [[material token|ID]] of -1 or {{token|NONE|mat}}, the same as used in tasks that require items of any or an unspecified material.

[[Door]]s and [[hatch cover]]s in [[dark pits]]{{bug|6776}} and [[Civilization#Dead and struggling civilizations|dead civilizations]]{{bug|3478}} have been known to generate as unknown material.

Since the material ID of -1 is used as a placeholder value for any material, items made of the unknown material cannot be specifically requested as an ingredient, even in [[modding|modded]] [[reaction]]s.

==Organic substances==

{{token|CREATURE_MAT|mat}} and {{token|PLANT_MAT|mat}} fall back to "unknown creature/plant substance" if they do not have a proper subtype. If solid, they will additionally be listed as "frozen".

==Other forms==

Other material categories have fallbacks in addition to their subtypes. Unlike unknown materials, they are functional when obtained.

Inorganic materials without a subtype become [[magma]] ({{token|INORGANIC|mat|NONE}}), or generic "rock" if solid.

The generic form of charcoal and coke ({{token|COAL|mat|NO_MATGLOSS}}) is known as [[refined coal]], which cannot be legitimately obtained.
