'''Tin glaze''' is a type of [[glaze]] that can be applied to jugs, statues, large pots, and crafts made of stone or [[ceramic]]s. It is applied to these items by a [[glazer]] at a [[kiln]] or [[magma kiln]] by using a chunk of [[cassiterite]].  Tin bars can't be used for this, so if you want to use tin glaze be sure not to smelt all of your cassiterite into tin.

Tin glaze has [[Item_value#Material_multipliers|material value]] of 10, worth twice as much as [[ash glaze]], likely partially due to its limited availability.  Otherwise, it is functionally identical, making [[earthenware]] jugs and large pots waterproof and able to store liquids.
