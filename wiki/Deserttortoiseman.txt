'''Desert tortoise men''' are humanoid versions of the common [[desert tortoise]] and a [[Creature|species]] of unremarkable [[animal people]], found in [[savage]] [[desert]] [[biome]]s. They are a little over half the size of an adult [[dwarf]] and spawn in groups of 1-5 individuals, who are unlikely to pose any danger to your fortress.

Like other savage animal people, desert tortoise men may occasionally join [[civilization]]s, becoming full-fledged citizens who may appear in your fortress as [[visitor]]s or be playable in [[adventurer mode]].

Some dwarves [[Preferences|like]] desert tortoise men for their ''shells'' and their ''longevity''.
