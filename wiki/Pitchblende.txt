'''Pitchblende''' is a [[magma-safe]] stone which occurs in small quantities within [[granite]]. It is green with [[premium]] graphics or purple with [[classic]] graphics.

Pitchblende is also especially [[density|heavy]], second only to [[cinnabar]] (and [[slade]]), so it is absolutely inappropriate for making [[large pot]]s and other commonly-[[hauling|hauled]] items, and preferable for [[trap|stone-fall traps]] and [[catapult]]s. Additionally, pitchblende [[craft]]s are so heavyweight they can fill up a caravan. Hauling pitchblende is not realistic without a [[wheelbarrow]], or at least will take an [[Time|eternity]].

==In real life== 
Pitchblende is an ore of uranium; while it cannot be smelted in ''Dwarf Fortress'', it is often used for decorative purposes within "nuclear reactors" in [[megaprojects]].

Uranium itself is only weakly radioactive while it decays into lead over billions of years, but among its intermediate decay products are radium and radon. Pitchblende (or uraninite, as it is now called) always contains small amounts of these elements, which are much more dangerous. Radon is especially hazardous as it is an invisible, odorless, tasteless noble gas that is easily inhaled (such as by uranium miners). Fortunately, dwarves are immune to the effects of ionizing radiation, and, provided they remain safe from other forms of [[fun]], they can live long, happy, healthy lives dwelling in bedrooms and dining rooms carved out of pitchblende deposits and furnished by pitchblende tables and chairs.

{{D for Dwarf}}
It has been speculated that, should the Dwarves work out how to refine and enrich uranium, the world would face a super-weapon even greater than that of the !!Thermonuclear [[catsplosion]]!!, as well as an incredible new power source. It is believed that Dwarves would proceed to use the new super-weapon to preemptively dispatch invaders, and ignore the potential new power source (since they have worked out how to create perpetual motion machines). Or they would find some way to [[brew]] it, giving them all mutant superpowers after a night of drunken partying.
