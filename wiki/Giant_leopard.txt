'''Giant leopards''' are strong carnivorous animals, slightly smaller than a standard [[cow]]. They are lonesome hunters, roaming savage [[tropical]] and [[desert]] areas. Giant leopards may also appear as [[mount]]s during a [[siege]].

Giant leopards may be [[tame]]d and kept as [[pet]]s, [[animal trainer|trained]] for hunting or war, or used as livestock for a [[meat industry]]. While they do not produce as much meat as other "giant" creatures, giant leopard [[butcher]]ing returns are worth four times as much as those of common domestic animals.

Some dwarves [[Preferences|like]] giant leopards for their ''spotted coats''.
