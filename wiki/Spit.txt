[[File:spit_icon_preview.png|right]]'''Spit''' is a kind of [[contaminant]], like [[blood]] or [[vomit]], that results from the action of spitting, treated as a "natural ability" by most creatures. Spitting mostly occurs in [[Adventure mode]], when NPCs encounter people that they hate, typically due to a bad [[reputation]] (as e.g. a murderer) or belonging to different [[faction]]s without being outright hostile (e.g. criminal organizations in [[town]]s). 

As an adventurer you can spit on anyone or anything you want, aiming it just like you would with a projectile. This is done in the abilities menu ({{Adv menu icon|X}}). If you get spit on, you can also drink it in an attempt to slake your [[thirst]], but it will have little (if any) effect, and won't add to fullness. 

Note that some creatures like [[magma crab]]s have very dangerous [[magma|spit]] indeed; appropriate [[modding]] can turn this mostly harmless expression of spite into a deadly weapon.
