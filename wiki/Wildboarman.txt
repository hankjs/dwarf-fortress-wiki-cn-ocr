'''Wild boar men''' are [[animal people]] versions of the common [[wild boar]], who can be found in almost all [[savage]] [[biome]]s. They spawn in groups of 5-10 individuals and are generally content to keep to themselves, but may fight back if provoked by approaching civilians. In terms of size, they are slightly larger than the average [[human]].

Like other savage animal people, they can join [[civilization]]s, become [[historical figure]]s, appear as [[visitor]]s and be playable in [[adventurer mode]]. Wild boar men are among the few animal people capable of wearing human-sized [[armor]] while retaining the primary advantage most animal men have of being larger than humans.

Some dwarves [[Preferences|like]] wild boar men for their ''tusks'' and their ''ferocious charges''.

In the unseen enclaves of the Underworld, it has been rumored that zombie '''wild boar men''' spawn, all wielding ☼Golden short swords☼ but being oddly non-aggressive. If provoked, however, they are said to retaliate in packs.
