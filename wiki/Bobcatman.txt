'''Bobcat men''' are humanoid versions of the common [[bobcat]] and a [[Creature|species]] of unremarkable [[animal people]], found in a variety of [[savage]] [[biome]]s. They are a little over half the size of an adult [[dwarf]] and are unlikely to pose a threat to a fortress' inhabitants. While not as rare as their fully-animal cousins, bobcat men are also few in number, with only a maximum of 10 potentially existing in the fortress' surroundings.

Like other savage animal people, bobcat men may occasionally join [[civilization]]s, becoming full-fledged citizens who may appear in your fortress as [[visitor]]s or be playable in [[adventurer mode]].

Some dwarves [[Preferences|like]] bobcat men for their ''short tails''.

Bobcat men will not raid your yarn stores, nor can they glide. They may occasionally make odd quips.
