'''Acacia''' is one of the many genera of [[tree]]s found on the surface, found in most dry [[tropical]] [[biome]]s, with the exception of deserts. 

Acacia wood is peach-colored, which is currently displayed in-game as brown, and thus produces brown products. It does not rate highly as a food source, as the seeds are not edible raw - only once cooked. Logs can be processed in a [[dyer's shop]] into chocolate [[dye]]. 

Some [[Dwarf|dwarves]] [[Preferences|like]] acacias for their ''thorns''.
