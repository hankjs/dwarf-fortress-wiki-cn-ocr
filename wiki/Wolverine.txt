'''Wolverines''' are small carnivorous [[creature]]s found in [[mountain]]s and [[taiga]]s. They are solitary, only appearing one at a time. Slightly larger than a [[honey badger]], they behave in a similar fashion, being prone to rage and randomly going in a violent frenzy for a while, much to the dismay of any [[dwarf]] who happens to be at their vicinity when it happens. When not enraged, they are benign and will flee from other creatures instead. A newborn wolverine is called a ''wolverine kit''.

Wolverines can be captured in [[cage]] [[trap]]s and [[Animal trainer|trained]] into cheap exotic [[pet]]s. They provide equivalent returns to a [[dog]] when [[butcher]]ed, making them an emergency source of [[food]] if needed. A trained wolverine can serve as a potential distraction against intruders if it rages when they arrive, but don't expect it to survive the encounter.

Some dwarves [[Preferences|like]] wolverines for their ''tenacity''.

<!-- Reference: Wolverine from X-Men -->
The claws of a wolverine are made out of pure [[adamantine]], and produce a distinctive 'snikt' sound when readied.

<!-- Reference: Napolean Dynamite -->
Be sure to use a powerful ranged weapon when dealing with many wolverines. They have been known to attack the cousins of some dwarves, causing said dwarves to retaliate. I mean... they kept trying to attack their cousins, what the heck would '''''you''''' do in a situation like that?!
