[[File:bestiary_preview.png|thumb|150px|right|An example bestiary in the Premium version.]]A '''bestiary''' is the set of creatures known and documented by an adventurer or NPC. Whenever you encounter an animal in the wild that's different from everything you've seen so far, its entry gets added to the bestiary. You may browse the bestiary to get (usually summary) information about all the creatures you've seen.

As an [[adventure mode|adventurer]]; your starting bestiary is limited to what your parent [[civilization]] knows, and if you're an outsider, it's empty. Most NPCs you first encounter have an empty bestiary; that is, they do not know what things are, including [[cat]]s and [[dog]]s, or indeed any common domestic animals. [[Historical figure]]s may have some knowledge of the animals they have encountered during their [[world generation|worldgen]] and post-worldgen history, but it will never be as expansive as that of a standard adventurer.
