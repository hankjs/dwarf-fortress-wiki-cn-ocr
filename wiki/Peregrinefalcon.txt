'''Peregrine falcons''' are small [[Creature|birds]] who can be found in almost every [[biome]], excluding [[ocean]]s, [[glacier]]s, and [[tropical]] rain [[forest]]s. They spawn one at a time and occasionally dive down from the sky to kill [[vermin]] on the ground, being harmless to a [[dwarf]] and benign to other creatures. Females are known as ''peregrine falcons'', while males are known as ''tiercel peregrines'' (tiercel meaning third, referring to the males being about 1/3rd smaller than the females, which is reflected in-game as a smaller body size for males) and their young are called ''peregrine falcon chicks''. All peregrine falcons are born with Legendary [[skill]] in [[Climber|climbing]].

Peregrine falcons can be captured with [[cage]] [[trap]]s and [[Animal trainer|trained]] into low-value [[pet]]s. They can be put into [[nest box]]es in order to be part of a fort's [[egg production]], but hatching them for [[meat]] is worthless – peregrine falcons are too small to produce anything but a [[skull]]. While they are the fastest birds in real life, reaching dive speeds of 200+ mph (320 km/h), ''Dwarf Fortress'' does not handle [[gait]]s faster than 87 km/h, instead using this as maximum flight speed, which nonetheless makes them the fastest fliers in the game. Note that trained peregrine falcons will no longer display their dive-hunting behavior, but when tamed they may hunt vermin, reflecting their real-life use in falconry.

Some dwarves [[Preferences|like]] peregrine falcons for their ''ability to dive through the air''.
