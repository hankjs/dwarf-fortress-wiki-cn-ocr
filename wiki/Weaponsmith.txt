'''Weaponsmith''' is the skill associated with the '''weaponsmithing''' [[labor]]. Weaponsmiths make [[metal]] [[weapon]]s (including [[crossbow]]s), [[trap_component|trap components]], [[pick]]s and [[bolt]]s at a [[metalsmith's forge]]. The skill level of the weaponsmith determines the [[quality]] of the produced weapons, as well as the speed of their production. Weaponsmiths also do well in the other smithing tasks, due to the [[attribute]]s needed to perform these.

Standard materials that a weaponsmith can use for most weapons are [[adamantine]], [[steel]], [[iron]], [[silver]], [[bronze]]/[[bismuth bronze]], [[copper]], and [[divine metal]]s. (See [[Weapon#Combat_testing|this chart]] for specific comparisons and recommendations.) Exceptions include [[Obsidian#Rock short sword|obsidian short swords]] (in a [[Craftsdwarf's workshop]]) and unpredictable items created during a [[strange mood]]. 

* For crossbows, see [[crossbow]]

Due to the necessity of weaponry in most forts and the high added value of weapons (especially quality ones) compared to their base material, a high-skill weaponsmith is a precious dwarf indeed. Honestly, you wouldn't let them go in the caverns and be eaten by some random [[giant cave spider]], now would you?
