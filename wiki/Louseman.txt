'''Louse men''' are [[animal people]] variants of the common [[louse]], who can inhabit most [[savage]] [[biome]]s. They spawn in groups of 1-3 individuals and are generally content to keep to themselves, but may pick fights if provoked. In terms of size, they are a little over half the weight of the average [[dwarf]]. All louse men are born with Legendary [[skill]] in [[Climber|climbing]].

Like other savage animal people, louse men can join [[civilization]]s, become [[historical figure]]s, appear as [[visitor]]s and be playable in [[adventurer mode]].

Some dwarves [[Preferences|like]] louse men for their ''ability to infest''.

{{D for Dwarf}}
So far we failed to locate the louse man called Roger Smith. A shame, considering how valuable the constructs he is said to possess would be for dwarfkind.
