'''Monarch butterflies''' are a type of [[above ground]] [[vermin]] found flying around in any area that is warmer than [[biome|freezing]], and will not go out in the winter. They may not be caught in [[animal trap]]s. All monarch butterflies possess Legendary [[skill]] in [[Climber|climbing]].

Some dwarves [[Preferences|like]] monarch butterflies for their ''coloration.

{{D for Dwarf}}
Be very, very careful of the possibility of a dead monarch butterfly jamming your main entrance open. It can lead to some truly absurd scenarios, as the folks at [[Bloodline:Boatmurdered|Boatmurdered]] can attest to.
