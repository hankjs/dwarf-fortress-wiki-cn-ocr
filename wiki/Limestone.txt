'''Limestone''', like [[dolomite]] and [[chalk]], is a [[flux]] [[stone]] which forms entire [[sedimentary layer]]s. In addition, limestone layers are the only sedimentary layers to contain [[galena]] or [[malachite]].

Limestone chunks can be used to make: [[steel]] [[bar]]s, [[pig iron]] [[bar]]s, [[quicklime]], [[furniture]] and can be used in building

In general, limestone layers tend to yield more [[ore]]s and [[gem]]s per volume mined than those of other stones, which makes them a prime candidate for exploratory [[mining]]. Any overburden thus generated will also be doubly valuable compared to regular stone for [[craft]]ing as a result of limestone's flux property.

"Limestone" is also the name of the seventh month of the dwarven [[calendar]], covering early Autumn.

==In real life==
Limestone is a sedimentary rock composed largely of minerals like [[calcite]]. It can also contain silica in the form of [[chert]], and varying amounts of [[clay]], [[silt]] and [[sand]] carried in by [[river]]s. In addition to its real-world use in steel production, limestone is highly durable and weather-resistant, and has been used in construction for, effectively, all of human history -- the Great Pyramids are built of limestone blocks.
