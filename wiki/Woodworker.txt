'''Woodworker''' is a category profession for dwarves that work with [[wood]], both harvesting and its subsequent processing into [[furniture]] or other items.  Note that some wood-related skills, such as [[Wood burner|burning wood]] or [[wood crafter|crafting]] do not fall under woodworker, but instead fall under the [[farmer]] or [[craftsdwarf]] category of professions instead.

An adult [[dwarf]] whose best [[skill]] is in this category, and who has accumulated ranks in one or more other woodworker skills (exactly how much is not clear) will be known as a "Woodworker".

Once he has achieved "grand master" skill in one of these skills, but not in the others, he will be known by this skill.

If a dwarf has experience in only one woodworker skill he will be known by his or her highest skill.

The woodworker skills are:

{{Skill Box|Woodworker|6:1|6:1|
* [[Bowyer]]
* [[Carpenter]]
* [[Wood cutter]]}}
