'''Nightwings''' are [[fanciful]], intelligent [[creature]]s who are only found in [[evil]] [[desert]]s, where they spawn one at a time. Resembling a humanoid jackal with wings, they are twice the size of the average [[dwarf]] and will attack them on sight, using their wings to fly away from attacks and mauling civilians with their fangs and nails. If under attack by a nightwing, it is recommended to fight it with [[crossbow]]s to take it out of the air before moving in with a melee squad, as they will make short work of it provided they can reach it.

Nightwings possess a great number of unusual characteristics. They need no sustenance to survive, don't need to breathe, are [[No Pain|immune to pain]] and [[No Exert|exertion]], don't feel fear or emotion, cannot be [[No Stun|stunned]] and nauseated, and are unaffected by dizziness or fevers. They will suck the [[blood]] out of those hit by their bite attacks, are born adults and are also genderless, meaning they are incapable of breeding. They are sapient (though they can't speak) and are able to equip items and open unforbidden [[door]]s.

Nightwings possess a [[pet]] value of 1,000, but lack the necessary tokens to be [[Animal trainer|trainable]] (and even if [[Modding|modded]] to be trainable, the fact they are intelligent creatures will lead to [[Animal_trainer#Taming_intelligent_creatures|strange behavior]]). Due to the aforementioned intelligence, dwarves will not [[butcher]], eat or use products made from nightwings, limiting their use to occupying space in your [[refuse]] [[stockpile]], [[live training]] or putting them somewhere of your liking if you capture one in a [[cage]] [[trap]].

Some dwarves [[Preferences|like]] nightwings for their ''jackal heads'', their ''bat wings'', their ''long tails'', their ''manes'', their ''fangs'', their ''ability to suck blood'', their ''tightly-stretched skin'' and their ''needle-like horns''.
