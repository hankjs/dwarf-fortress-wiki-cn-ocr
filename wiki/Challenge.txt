If "vanilla" ''Dwarf Fortress'' wasn't difficult enough for you, consider '''challenges'''. Challenges can make the game harder, or just give you an objective to strive for.

==Playstyle challenges==
{{main|Playstyle challenge}}
Restrict the way you play the game with self-enforced rules - only embark with certain items and skills, or restrict your playstyle in other ways.

==Construction challenges==
{{main|Megaproject}}
Try building some ridiculously humongous, complicated construction, using whatever appropriate building method your fevered imagination can come up with! Need some ideas?  Take a look at the [[megaproject]]s page! See the [[mega construction]] page for tips and tricks related to constructing megaprojects.

==Whatever challenges==
{{main|Stupid dwarf trick}}
Do whatever [[stupid dwarf trick]] floats your boat.
