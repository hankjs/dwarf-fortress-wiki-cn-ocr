'''Stoneware''' is a type of [[ceramic]] made from [[fire clay]] at a [[kiln]]. Much like [[green glass]] (and [[clear glass]], to a lesser extent), stoneware items can be produced in unlimited quantities  as long as you have a source of [[fire clay]] in your fortress. They are green in color and have a material value of 4, greater than that of [[earthenware]] despite not actually being more difficult to produce.

Unlike earthenware, stoneware containers can be used to store liquids without being [[glaze]]d.
