'''Opossum men''' are [[animal people]] versions of the common [[opossum]], inhabiting [[savage]] [[temperate]] [[forest]]s and flatlands. They spawn in groups of 1-5 individuals and are generally content to keep to themselves. In terms of size, they are a little over half the weight of the average [[dwarf]].

Like other savage animal people, they can join [[civilization]]s, become [[historical figure]]s, appear as [[visitor]]s and be playable in [[adventurer mode]].

Some dwarves [[Preferences|like]] opossum men for their ''ability to play dead''.

{{D for Dwarf}}
Despite what some forms of media may portray, there are no armored opossum men known as "rocket knights" with the ability to fly, and do not fight evil pig men or boar men of any kind.
