'''Monitor lizards''' are [[creature]]s who can be found in [[tropical]] plains and [[forest]]s. They spawn individually, meandering through the area and usually minding their own business. While carnivorous and nearly twice the size of a [[dwarf]], monitor lizards are not especially aggressive animals, and are unlikely to pose a threat unless provoked, though they may attempt to take a bite out of nearby [[dog]]s and other small [[domestic animal]]s. Their population is quite low compared to other creatures, and no more than ten monitor lizards will spawn in the area before they are [[extinct]].

Monitor lizards can be captured with [[cage]] [[trap]]s and [[Animal trainer|trained]] into valuable exotic [[pet]]s. They are rather prolific [[egg]]-layers, laying from 15 to 25 eggs at a time, which makes them a great target for [[egg production]]. Breeding them will quickly fill the fortress with lizards, who can be [[butcher]]ed into a nice amount of [[food]] and [[bone]]s when they reach their maximum size. Products made from monitor lizard parts are [[Item value|worth]] twice more than those of standard animals.

Some dwarves [[Preferences|like]] monitor lizards for their ''intelligence''.
