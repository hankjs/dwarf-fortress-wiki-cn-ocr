'''Clutter''' will occur in [[workshop]]s when they become full of goods that are not hauled away to stockpiles. There is currently no indication when a workshop gets cluttered. The list of items in the workshop screen will show you what items are cluttering the workshop.

Dwarves working in cluttered workshops will work more slowly: even the lowest level of clutter doubles the time a workshop task takes. Each successive level of clutter increases the multiplier by one, so tasks performed in a completely cluttered workshop will take ten times as long.

(currently not shown in game, but values are probably still correct) {{verify}}

The amount of clutter generated by a single item is determined by its [[size|volume]], however, all items generate a maximum of 1200 units of clutter each.

== Remedy ==
{{migrated section}}
To remedy clutter, be sure to have enough stockpile space of the appropriate kind (using [[bin|bins]] will increase stockpile efficiency), and employ enough dwarves with the appropriate [[hauling]] jobs (food/furniture/item/refuse/etc.) to get rid of the junk. The dwarf working at the workshop could also have the relevant hauling job enabled, pausing from time to time to move around goods. In case of inexperienced cooks, order only one or two meals at a time, and check clutter before issuing new orders. An alternate clutter control method is to build new workshops, optionally destroying the old ones (from the {{k|q}} or {{k|t}} menu).

== Benefits ==
There is one upside to clutter, depending on your viewpoint and playstyle. As a workshop's production is slowed, so is their consumption of raw materials and their output if there is little demand. If there is sudden spike of demand, the workshop is easily uncluttered and can work at full speed. The benefit of this is that tasks can be left in repeat mode with no supervision and will not produce much unwanted extras or consume more resources than needed.  

A [[still]], for example, can eventually get to the rate where dwarves consume booze at the same speed as the cluttered workshops produce it. [[Wood furnace|Wood furnaces]] similarly will eventually be brought to a point where they produce fuel at the same rate as other workshops consume it.

If [[stockpile|stockpiles]] are used with this method, they must all be kept completely full, so that the workshop remains cluttered.  Your stockpile will become a sort of buffer to compensate for large spikes in demand.  The larger your booze stockpile is, the larger of a spike in demand it can compensate for when, say, a tantrum spiral erupts.

* [[Cook]]ing with [[egg]]s creates extreme [[kitchen]] clutter. {{Bug|3994}}

== Production Equilibrium ==
{{Template:D for dwarf}}
The unique dwarven economic system, which has been called 'confusing' at best and 'insane' at worst by most other species, has at least one benefit. The fact that items are rarely moved from where they were made until needed leads to much clutter around workshops. As the clutter builds and makes it more difficult to move around the workshop, production slows more and more. If demand suddenly spikes, the clutter is removed and production rises again. Some scientists see this as an instinctual supply and demand device. Others see it as dumb luck.
