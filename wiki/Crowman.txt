'''Crow men''' are [[animal people]] variants of the common [[crow]] who inhabit a variety of [[savage]] [[temperate]] [[biome]]s as well as [[taiga]]s. They spawn in groups of anywhere between 5-10 individuals and are generally content to keep to themselves. In terms of size, they are a little over half the weight of the average [[dwarf]]. All crow men are born with Legendary [[skill]] in [[Climber|climbing]].

Like other savage animal people, crow men can join [[civilization]]s, become [[historical figure]]s, appear as [[visitor]]s and be playable in [[adventurer mode]].

Some dwarves [[Preferences|like]] crow men for their ''intelligence''.

{{D for Dwarf}}
As the crow man flies is a common expression among some [[Human|human]] cultures, as [[Adventurer mode|most crow men they see]] seem to know exactly where they're going after a couple weeks, and won't stop even for [[Wound|inconvenient]] [[Fun|and]] [[Death|negligible]] [[Fun|annoyances]].

Crow men seem to like wandering around ruins and temples, and caw at anyone who gets in their way.
