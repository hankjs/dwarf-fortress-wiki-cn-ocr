[[File:catsplosion before.png|right|thumb|Before.]][[File:catsplosion after.png|right|thumb|After.]]The '''catsplosion''' is a mighty force of nature and a serious concern at the Mountainhome. Much like one of the captains of a popular starship and his ''Trouble with Tribbles'', dwarves fall prey to the fecund habits of the furry, lovable creatures known as <s>furiously fornicating fantastically fecund felines</s> [[cat]]s.
== Conventional catsplosion ==

[[File:catsplosion.jpg|thumb|300px|right|Anyone know a talented butcher?]]A '''conventional catsplosion''' is an uncontrolled overpopulation of cats.

Conventional catsplosions are an insidious poison which operate by using a lethal psychological attack known as "Cuddly Wuddly Syndrome". Dwarves, ordinarily content to manage an overpopulation of cats by employing [[butcher]]s, [[tanner]]s, [[soaper]]s, [[leatherworker]]s, [[bone carver]]s, and [[cook]]s, may suddenly find themselves appropriated by a cat who employs mind control waves in order to take the dwarf hostage. The dwarf, now considering the cat its pet (when in fact the opposite is true), is no longer able to butcher the cat and will absolutely not tolerate anyone butchering his "bewuv'ed cuddlebug". Through this psychological technique, an insurgent is thereby successfully implanted into the fortress.

Over time, the number of insurgents grows so large that the dwarves must respond with open violence to protect their homes and (other) loved ones. [[Magma]], [[water]], and [[bridge]]s are considered particularly effective countermeasures. Sadly, this results in significant unhappy thoughts and even open [[tantrum]]s due to dwarves losing their "pets".

=== Dealing with conventional catsplosions ===
==== Part 1: Gelding ====

A [[gelder]] is all it takes to take care of a catsplosion these days - simply assign male cats for gelding and they will never breed again.

The instructions below are only useful if the player [[Stupid dwarf trick|deliberately refuses to go for the easy way out]].

==== Part 2: Keeping "Cuddly Wuddly Syndrome" (CWS) under control ====
One word: [[cage]].

Do not leave stray cats wandering around or they will surely appropriate one of your citizens as a pet.  Before your cat population gets out of control, quickly build a [[cage]] and assign all stray cats to it.  If you do want some cat breeding in the long run, just leave a breeding pair outside and they will sooner or later become "pets".  From then on, the moment you get
an announcement that says "(SomePetName), Cat (Tame) has given birth to kitten(s)", quickly assign all new kittens to the cage.  If they stay in the cage, they cannot hold your dwarves in thrall to them.  If you manage to assign the cats quick enough and they manage to adopt someone prior to being put in the cage, they still will be put in it.

==== Part 3: Getting rid of the unwanted cats ====

The options are as follows:
* [[Butcher|Butchering]]. This still has a certain risk that the cat will infect a worker dwarf with CWS (although he may still butcher ''other'' cats) on the way to the [[butcher's shop]], so care must be taken to ensure that the distance is short. It is highly recommended that the cage intended for stray cat containment is built right next to a couple of [[Butcher's shop|butcher's shops]]. You can quickly assign any newborn kittens to be slaughtered through the animals section of the ({{k|z}})status menu.
* [[Trading]]. This is the only 100% safe way to get rid of stray cats in a cage. When a trader approaches your fortress, de-construct the cat cage to move it to the animal stockpile. Then set the cat cage for trading at the depot to move it there. Once at the depot, convert the cats into cash, or even just offer it outright to get rid of it. WARNING: there are confirmed bugs with trading creatures in cages. See the [[cage]] article for further details.
* [[Trap#Other traps|Execution Traps]]. A deep drop into magma, water, or a very hard floor will usually do the job.<br />Since the introduction of [[Activity_zone#Pen/Pasture|pen/pasture zones]] a cat owner will happily place their cat in the pen/pasture, pull the adjacent lever and walk away while the soft splat of a kitten's cruel end is lost in a sound of thunder.
* Using a [[zone#Garbage dump|dump zone]] to throw items off [[cliff]]s or [[building]]s and [[zone#Pen.2FPasture|pasturing]] cats below it will often seriously injure cats - especially if the drop is at least 20 z-levels. [[Cobaltite]], [[cinnabar]], and other heavy materials usually work best. 
* [[Modding]]. Removing the [[creature token]] {{token|ADOPTS_OWNER|c}} will, yes, stop cats from adopting owners. If you're feeling vindictive, however, you can instead remove one or more of the cats' vital organs, causing them all to cease being alive. Note that this solution will lead to negative thoughts on all cat owners.

==== Part 4: Sexism ====

This solution requires micromanagement every 10 years, but solves it for all time!

* Cage all cats. Sort the female cats in a walled in room with no access. Release enough male cats to cover pet and vermin-eating needs of dwarves for 10 years or so. Let every dwarf have one without the possibility of breeding!

Once every 10 years or so, breed another batch. Cage kittens as they come out.

This is better done as an all-male than an all-female population, in case a single wrong-sex cat strays from the plan - only one cat pregnant then in generation 1, instead of potentially most of them. This means you keep all aspects of cats, except the breeding is confined to once per 10 years! You could theoretically put all pets in walled-in rooms. No pet deaths, no tantrums, no miasma!

P.S.: if you manage to put all the female cats in a walled-in room, remember that kittens will appear only there - a good spot for a butcher shop and some kind of item drop chutes for ready food and junk disposal. Cats keep your butcher shop free of vermin, too!

P.P.S.: Every time you use a cage on a cat the blood god is deprived from killing seven generations of kittens; so for the love of Armok, remember to sacrifice him some goblins in extra creative ways to compensate! Such as having a pit with all the female cats in the bottom attacking them...

== Thermonuclear catsplosion ==
Thanks to the [[Main:Scamps|Scamps]] Conventions of 0.28.181.40d and 0.31.03, the number of Thermonuclear Catsplosions has been drastically reduced, for the ignition keys are now by law hidden in a very [[Fun]] [[Hell|place]] after worldgen. They are, therefore, unavailable to prospective <s>modders</s> elf-fondling terrorists to use after then without causing drastic, system-wide instability to their computer networks.

As a warning, here's [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UcZjYQFkkxw the only video footage ever recovered from the horrible aftermath of a thermonuclear catsplosion.]

==Other -splosions==
=== Cavysplosion ===
Another problem is little adorable furry things running everywhere. '''[[cavy|Cavies]]''', another name for guinea pigs, are small and give only a skull when butchered. They are [[grazer]]s and tend to ''hog'' the grass from your other grazing animals (while they don't eat much grass individually, a large group can easily rid a small pasture of grass). Their only benefit is that they make decent pets (but have a low [[Pet#Pet value|pet value]]). If you refuse to geld them for some reason, [[#Part 4: Sexism|separating male and female cavies]] is a way of preventing excessive breeding, but most other techniques used on cats can be applied to cavies too.

=== Birdsplosion ===
Many domestic animals, such as [[Domestic animal#Comparison of domestic poultry|chickens, ducks and geese]], use the [[nest box]] to lay eggs. The huge number of eggs they lay means that, if fertilized by a male, they tend to create their own birdsplosion, in which millions of fuzzy ducklings take over your fort. Although this is not as much a concern as the catsplosion, due to not being adopted as pets, there are still FPS concerns. The best known method to prevent a birdsplosion is to run a campaign on the benefits of eggs for your dwarves. Also? Battery farms. One cage is enough. Don't tell <s>PETA</s> [[Elf|EETA]]<nowiki/>. Unlike cats, birds cannot be gelded, which should be kept in mind.

=== Crocsplosion ===

Given that all crocodilians ([[alligator]]s, [[cave crocodile]]s, [[saltwater crocodile]]s) have an enormous clutch size, any successful breeding of these will cause a crocsplosion when the eggs hatch. After that, the mother (and eventually your animal trainers) will be surrounded by a veritable swarm of crocodile hatchlings everywhere. Like the birdsplosion, this can't be stopped with gelding, as reptiles are not geldable.

Be extra super careful about having several mother crocodiles breed at the same time, because it will make your FPS suffer horribly.

=== Iguanasplosion ===

An uncommon but quite true occurrence, iguanasplosion is much like a crocsplosion, but it involves [[iguana]]s and [[giant chameleon]]s. These uncommonly-found creatures lay a strangely immense amount of eggs, and like crocodiles, allowing them to breed will quickly fill the fortress with ungeldable reptiles. Treat it as you would a crocsplosion.
