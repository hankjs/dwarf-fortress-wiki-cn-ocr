A '''bloodline game''', otherwise known as a "[[Succession Games|Succession game]]", is a game of Dwarf Fortress, normally played in Fortress mode, which is passed between multiple players in succession. Generally each player has their own unique management strategy, so with each turn one could expect significant changes to be made to the fortress. A classic example, from an earlier version of Dwarf Fortress, is [[Boatmurdered]]. 

Bloodline games are often described turn by turn as a story, preferably with screenshots, illustrating everything that happens under the rule of each player.
