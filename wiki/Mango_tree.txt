'''Mango trees''' are a type of [[above ground]] [[tree]], found only in [[tropical]] [[forest|forests]]. Mango [[wood]] is brown ("burnt sienna" as described in the raws) and produces brown products. 

Mango trees bear '''mangoes''' that can be harvested by setting up a gathering [[zone]]. They can be eaten raw, cooked, or brewed into [[alcohol|mango wine]].

Some [[Dwarf|dwarves]] [[Preferences|like]] mango trees for their ''sweet-smelling flowers''.

Some [[human]] [[boss|bosses]] insist that they will farm mangoes after one last job, and that the other [[bandit]]s just need to trust them.
