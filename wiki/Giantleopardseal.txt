'''Giant leopard seals''' are the second-largest [[seal]]-like creature in the game (with [[giant elephant seal]]s being about twice as large for [[female]]s and 9 times as large for [[male]]s - see [[List of creatures by adult size|this page]] for more information).

Giant leopard seals are ''massive'' compared to ordinary [[leopard seal]]s - nearly 10 times bigger, in fact. Since healthy dwarves [[food#Mechanics|eat about twice per season]] and giant leopard seals can provide up to 230 units of food, a giant leopard seal could feed 115 dwarves for a season (3 months or 84 days), 28 dwarves for a year (4 seasons), or a single dwarf for ''115 seasons'' (over 28 ''years''). And if that sounds like a lot, an adult [[giant sperm whale]] is over 50 times larger. 

Giant leopard seals are extremely [[fun]] around dwarves, and can easily kill unarmed dwarves (even highly skilled swimmers) by ripping off limbs. Even grand master [[fighter]]s usually lose to giant leopard seals, inflicting only bruises upon their opponent. The best defense against these creatures is [[magma|a dwarf's best friend]].
