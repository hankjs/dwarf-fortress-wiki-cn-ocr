'''Moose men''' are [[animal people]] variants of the common [[moose]] who can be found in [[savage]] [[temperate]] [[forest]]s and [[taiga]]. They spawn in groups of 5-10 individuals and, like their animal counterparts, possess notable sexual dimorphism; moose women are about as large as a [[llama]], while moose men are about the size of an [[elk]]. Because of their large size, [[dwarves]] who provoke them stand little chance unless they happen to be [[soldier]]s.

Like other savage animal people, they can join [[civilization]]s, become [[historical figure]]s, appear as [[visitor]]s and be playable in [[adventurer mode]].

Some dwarves [[Preferences|like]] moose men for their ''broad antlers'' and ''large size''.
