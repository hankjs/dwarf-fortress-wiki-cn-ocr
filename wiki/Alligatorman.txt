'''Alligator men''' are humanoid versions of the common [[alligator]] and a [[Creature|species]] of [[animal people]], found in [[savage]] [[swamp]]s and [[river]]s. They are nearly 4 times bigger than [[dwarf|dwarves]] when adults and spawn in groups of 1-3 individuals, and as such make potentially dangerous opponents to the average unarmed civilian. Approach them with caution.

Like other savage animal people, alligator men may occasionally join [[civilization]]s, becoming full-fledged citizens who may appear in your fortress as [[visitor]]s or be playable in [[adventurer mode]]. Due to being based on the raw files of the normal animal, they lack the ability to jump.

Some dwarves [[Preferences|like]] alligator men for their ''strength''.

<!-- Reference: ??? -->
Be wary around alligator women, for they are known for biting the legs of careless dwarves in [[taverns]].

<!-- Reference: "Big-Lipped Alligator Moment" trope from the "All Dogs Go To Heaven" animated movie -->
There have been instances of "big-lipped" alligator men appearing out of nowhere and causing confusion and/or laughter, before quickly leaving.

<!-- Reference: "Five Nights at Freddy's: Security Breach" video game -->
Some visitors may enjoy alligator men as performers in taverns, but care should be taken due to heavy rivalry between them and [[Hare man|hare men]], especially when deciding the bassist of a four-[[Animal person|animal person]] band.

<!-- Reference: Batman villain 'Killer Croc' -->
[[Batmen]] are said to be frequently antagonized by Crocodile men, mostly by humans. No dwarf has ever seen a [[Crocodile]] man, the misattribution can most likely be chalked up to classic [[human]] stupidity.
