'''Kestrel men''' are [[animal people]] variants of the common [[kestrel]], who inhabit a variety of [[savage]] regions. They spawn in groups of anywhere between 1-5 individuals and are generally content to keep to themselves. In terms of size, they are a little over half the weight of the average [[dwarf]]. All kestrel men are born with Legendary [[skill]] in [[Climber|climbing]].

Like other savage animal people, kestrel men can join [[civilization]]s, become [[historical figure]]s, appear as [[visitor]]s and be playable in [[adventurer mode]].

Some dwarves [[Preferences|like]] kestrel men for their ''coloration'' and their ''hunting prowess''.
