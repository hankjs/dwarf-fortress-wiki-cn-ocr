==Usage==

[[Historical figure|Legendary beings]], such as many [[Demon|demons]], associated with the [[Sphere|spheres]] of depravity, jealousy, lies, murder, nightmares, theft, torture, or treachery will have words from this symbol in their name. It is unknown if the [[Creature token#EVIL|EVIL]] token also has this linkage.

Alongside [[Language SYM.txt/Death|DEATH]], [[Language SYM.txt/Negative|NEGATIVE]], and [[Language SYM.txt/Ugly|UGLY]], EVIL is one of the possible [[Entity token#SUBSELECT_SYMBOL|subsymbols]] available to [[Surroundings#Evil|evil biomes]].

Most [[Entity|cultures]], barring [[Goblin|goblins]], [[Entity token#CULL_SYMBOL|don't use]] words from this symbol for their names. Goblins will instead [[Entity token#SELECT_SYMBOL|use]] it to  [[Goblin language|name]] citizens, sites and governments.
