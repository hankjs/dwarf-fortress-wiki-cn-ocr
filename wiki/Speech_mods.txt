[[Dwarf Fortress]]' [[Speech]] files determine the exact dialog (mostly in [[adventurer mode]]) between two characters, such as the threats an important enemy will make to you before attacking, or the response when you ask a [[child]] his or her profession. The files may be found in the Dwarf Fortress folder, in the directory "data/speech". These files are easily modified by adding additional lines of text, one entry per line. Take for instance, the file "positive.txt":

 fantastic!
 wonderful!
 I'm thrilled to hear that.
 I'm pleased to hear that.
 that is good news.
 that is wonderful news.
 this is encouraging.
 very good.
 I'm proud of you.
 that is a good turn of affairs.

A file may also contain a variable in brackets. Instead of displaying the variable, Dwarf Fortress will display its contents (often the age of the speaker, their profession, or someone they killed.) For instance, the file "hist_fig_slayer.txt":

 It is I that felled [CONTEXT:HIST_FIG:TRANS_NAME] the [CONTEXT:HIST_FIG:RACE].

This can be thought of as the speaker saying "It is I that felled (translated name of a historical figure) the (race)". The result may look like:

 It is I that felled Urist Skyseal the dwarf.

To figure out the exact meaning of the variable(s) involved, it is usually sufficient to see how they are used in the actual game. In other cases, their meaning is obvious by the name of the file and the dialog before or after their usage.


== The Usage of this Page ==

The contents of speech files are to be placed here with the intention of any user adding new possible replies to them as they see fit. Another user may then copy the new dialog to their appropriate files and enrich their [[Dwarf Fortress]] experience. They may also neglect to include entries they do not like, if they should choose.

=== How do I add a new entry? ===

Simply place it at the ''bottom'' of the appropriate table. Be sure to check that your entry isn't already in the table to avoid duplicates. If an entire file is missing from the page, feel free to create the table for it yourself, but please include the default entry or entries along with any you add. Please do not ''remove'' an entry from a file unless it is obviously vandalism. When in doubt, leave a message on the talk page expressing your concern.

It is also worth noting that these entries should ''not'' break the fourth wall. As an example, the character speaking should not be aware that they are in a computer game.

 who walks with the gods now
 whose voice cried out and was suddenly silenced
 whose story is ended
 who recently became a martyr for mediocrity
 who will never know another day
 who tried to fight [PRO_POS] fate
 who was made to swallow [PRO_POS] own weapon
 whose face met my foot at high velocity
 whose name shall be buried by the sands of time, forgotten by all
 who has gone to where all men and beasts one day go
 who I barely remember
 whose ghost I laugh at
 whose grave I piss on
 enjoys the taste of worm
 whose bones have made a fine back scratcher
 who knows the taste of death
