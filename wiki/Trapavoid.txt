[[Creatures]] with the '''{{token|TRAPAVOID}}''' [[Creature token|token]] cannot be affected by normal [[trap]]s, and do not set off [[pressure plate]]s. By ignoring a large part of some players' [[defense guide|defenses]], such creatures can be difficult to deal with.

==Creatures who avoid traps==
These creatures possess the {{token|TRAPAVOID}} token.

*[[Angel]]s
*[[Bogeyman|Bogeymen]]
*[[Demon]]s
*[[Experiment]]s
*[[Forgotten beast]]s
*[[Gremlin]]s
*[[Kobold]]s
*[[Night troll]]s
*[[Titan]]s
*[[Werebeast]]s (in werebeast form only)

Note that all [[Animal trainer|tamed]] and formerly tame animals, along with [[dwarves]], will never trigger traps, so it's safe to put traps right in front of your doorways.

==Trapping trapavoiders==
Despite the difficulty in trapping trapavoiders, it's not necessary to rely on your [[military]] to defeat them. Several special trapping techniques can be used instead.

===Spike trap===
[[Trap#Upright Spear/Spike|Retracting spike]] traps can be used against trapavoiders as easily as against any other creature. Of course, such traps need to be triggered somehow, either by [[lever]], or by a [[repeater]] of some sort. (Any other manually triggerable [[trap design]] can be used instead.)

===Web or loss of consciousness===
Trapavoiders become vulnerable to traditional traps when they are [[web|webbed]] or [[unconscious]]. One can take advantage of this, usually to [[cage]] the uncageable, by building traps in a [[silk farm]] or by building a [[construction|constructed floor]] on top of a [[support]] and surrounding the area under it with traditional traps-- what is known as a [[cave-in]] trap.

===Trap by rule-out===
The very fact that trapavoiders are unable to set off pressure plates allows one to build special traps to catch trapavoiders. By building a pressure plate set to be triggered by all weights, including civilians, you can be relatively certain that anything that doesn't set off the pressure plate is a trapavoider. Designs based around this concept can route civilians and trap-vulnerable creatures one way, and divert everything that doesn't trigger the pressure plate through another corridor-- perhaps one filled with retracting spikes connected to a repeater.
