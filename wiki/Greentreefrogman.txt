'''Green tree frog men''' are humanoid versions of the common [[green tree frog]] and a [[Creature|species]] of unremarkable [[animal people]], found in [[savage]] [[temperate]] freshwater [[biome]]s. They are only a little over half the size of an adult [[dwarf]], and as such are unlikely to pose a threat to a civilian's life. All green tree frog men are born with Legendary [[skill]] in [[Climber|climbing]].

Like other savage animal people, green tree frog men may occasionally join [[civilization]]s, becoming full-fledged citizens who may appear in your fortress as [[visitor]]s or be playable in [[adventurer mode]].

Some dwarves [[Preferences|like]] green tree frog men for their ''distinct mating call''.

Green tree frog men are observed to have extreme reactions or emotions toward topics. They often gather in large groups to talk about their life experiences and how 
they can't get a girlfriend.
