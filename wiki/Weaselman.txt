'''Weasel men''' are humanoid versions of the common [[weasel]] and a [[Creature|species]] of unremarkable [[animal people]], found in most [[savage]] regions. They are a little over half the size of [[dwarf|dwarves]] when adults and spawn in groups of 1-5 individuals. They should pose no threat unless provoked.

Like other savage animal people, weasel men may occasionally join [[civilization]]s, becoming full-fledged citizens who may appear in your fortress as [[visitor]]s or be playable in [[adventurer mode]].

Some dwarves [[Preferences|like]] weasel men for their ''long bodies'' and their ''short legs''.
