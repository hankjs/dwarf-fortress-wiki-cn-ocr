'''Sasquatches''' are large, [[fanciful]], dangerous [[creature]]s found in [[savage]] [[temperate]] [[forest]]s and [[taiga]]s. They are fully capable of massacring dozens of unarmed [[dwarves]] due to their large size, and their disposition to [[building_destroyer#Dangerous_Fun_Variety|destroy buildings]] will draw them into contact with fortresses, where they will topple [[furniture]] and wreck [[workshop]]s in their path. Sasquatches can equip items and open unlocked [[door]]s, though the former is not typically seen in normal play and the latter is normally ignored, as the Sasquatch will simply destroy the whole door instead of opening it.

Sasquatches are exceptionally rare creatures and share their [[biome]] with dozens of other animals, making sighting them a very uncommon event. Even if you do encounter them, since they have a relatively low population number, no more than 5-10 Sasquatches will spawn before they become [[extinct]] in your [[biome]]. Despite their humanoid physiology, Sasquatches are not intelligent and your dwarves will gleefully [[butcher]] them into [[food]] and [[bone]]s for crafting. Items made from Sasquatch parts are [[Item value|worth]] 3 times more than those of your standard [[domestic animal]]s.

Sasquatches can be captured with [[cage]] [[trap]]s, but cannot be [[Animal trainer|trained]]. If the player doesn't want to butcher them for meat, their extremely long lifespan can make them valuable as permanent decorations for your fortress.

Some dwarves [[Preferences|like]] Sasquatches for their ''reclusive nature''.

{{D for Dwarf}}
Also known as "Bigfoot" by the [[human]]s, the Sasquatch has been sought by fervent Cryptozoologists, a job title the tall ones made up. Despite several generations of camping out in the wild and being exposed to the elements of fun, the foolish humans never seem to be able to find one. Dwarves have killed and eaten (or been eaten by) many Sasquatches over the centuries, proving not only that Sasquatches exist, but that there is a thriving population to make them a viable food source, and that humans are either not very good at finding giant angry things, or are simply stupid. A good day for dwarfkind, it is.

Contrary to popular belief, Sasquatches do not steal dried meat products from human caravans. There are also no recorded events of humans annoying Sasquatches in relation to any aforementioned dried meat products or the advertisement for such products. They do, however, possess considerable skill at soap-making.
