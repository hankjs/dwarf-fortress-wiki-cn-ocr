'''Rhinoceroses''' are [[creature]]s found in [[tropical]] plains, where they appear in herds of 3 to 7 individuals. These massive animals are among the largest mundane land creatures in the game, essentially being smaller [[elephant]]s, though they're benign meanderers, more prone to fleeing from [[Dwarf|dwarves]] than attacking them. If pushed over the edge, however, a rhinoceros will quickly turn a dwarf into paste under its weight. A newborn rhinoceros is called a ''calf''.

Rhinoceroses can be captured in [[cage]] [[trap]]s and [[Animal trainer|trained]] into valuable exotic [[pet]]s. They become [[grazer]]s after being trained and, as such, require a [[pasture]], and due to their great size, they require a significant patch of [[grass]]. They can receive additional war training as well, which will remove their benign demeanor and turn them into one of the strongest war beasts you could possibly have, though their {{token|MEANDERER}} tag will cause them to move around very slowly. They also make excellent livestock, as a [[butcher]]ed rhinoceros will provide plentiful returns which are [[Item value|worth]] ''five'' times more than those made from common animals. Rhinoceroses take 10 years to reach maturity, although they're fully grown by the age of 5. Additionally, they are exotic [[mount]]s and, as such, may appear ridden by surface races during [[siege]]s, providing much [[fun]] to an unprepared fortress.

Some dwarves [[Preferences|like]] rhinoceroses for their ''horns''.
