'''Hornbill men''' are [[animal people]] variants of the common [[hornbill]], who inhabit [[savage]] [[tropical]] [[forest]]s. They spawn in groups of 1-5 individuals and are generally content to keep to themselves. In terms of size, they are little over half the weight of the average [[dwarf]]. All hornbill men are born with Legendary [[skill]] in [[Climber|climbing]].

Like other savage animal people, hornbill men can join [[civilization]]s, become [[historical figure]]s, appear as [[visitor]]s and be playable in [[adventurer mode]].

Some dwarves [[Preferences|like]] hornbill men for their ''great bills''.
