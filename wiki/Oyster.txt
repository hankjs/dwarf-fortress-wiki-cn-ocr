'''Oysters''' are a common source of [[food]] for fortresses located near an [[ocean]]. They are also one of the few types of creatures, along with [[mussel]]s, [[pond turtle]]s, [[nautilus]]es, and [[cave lobster]]s, that are sources of [[shell]]s. They can't be [[butcher]]ed, but are [[fish cleaning|cleaned]] at a [[fishery]], which generates a shell and prepared oyster. Oysters can also be cooked whole (as "raw oysters") and even cooked ''live'' (if you happen to catch one in an [[animal trap]] using the "[[fishery|catch live fish]]" job).

Oysters are [[hateable]] vermin and will give unhappy [[thought]]s to [[dwarves]] who absolutely detest oysters when they encounter them.

Some [[dwarves]] [[Preferences|like]] oysters for their ''beauty''.
