}}'''Memorials''' are buildings which can be built from the {{k|b}}uild menu under {{k|Alt}}+{{k|s}}. To create one, you first need to order a blank [[slab]] at a [[stoneworker's workshop]] ({{k|a}}, {{k|Alt}}+{{k|s}}), then order an [[engraver]] to make the unengraved slab into a memorial at a [[stoneworker's workshop]] ({{k|a}}, {{k|Alt}}+{{k|s}}). When placing the memorial (listed under 'slab' in the build menu), hitting 'x' on the materials menu will expand the list and let you pick which specific memorial you want. Once engraved, they can be built as an alternative to [[coffin]]s - failure to memorialize or entomb a deceased dwarf may lead to [[ghost|unexpected consequences]]. If you're having trouble finding which slab you want to place, use {{k|x}} to expand the list and find named or blank slabs.

Examining the memorial will show a short description of the deceased:  the year when they died or went missing, their cause of death, who or what killed them (if applicable), any [[nobility]] position they held, and may also mention one or more of their [[preference]]s.  It will also note if they were a mother or a father. 

You can create a [[memorial hall]] from a memorial's {{k|q}}uery menu. Memorial halls appear to serve as additional [[meeting hall]]s: free dwarves will congregate in the area and receive happy [[thought]]s from the decorations.

Oddly, it is also possible to engrave memorials to [[goblin|invaders]], [[forgotten beast]]s, and even ''merchant [[wagon]]s'' (not just the merchants, but the wagon itself!). This can be used to create trophy halls full of goblin skeletons and weapons, or to memorialize a deceased warrior's [[kill list]] inside of his tomb.

Memorials work inconsistently for merchants' escorts--some deceased caravan guards are not included in the list of potential memorial subjects. This behavior is presumably a bug, but you can avoid problems by placing dead caravan guards into coffins whenever possible.
