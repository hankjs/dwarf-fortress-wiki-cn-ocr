'''Vultures''' are flying [[creature]]s found in [[desert]]s and some [[tropical]] plains. They spawn in flocks of 5-10 individuals, causing constant job interruption spam, scaring [[Domestic animal|livestock]] out of [[pasture]]s and, most notably, attempting to [[Steals food|steal your food]] before flying away with it. This can be quite nasty to a newly-embarked fortress which has not yet settled up their food industry or made [[farm plot]]s. Vultures are essentially tropical [[buzzard]]s, except they are considerably larger; nearly seven times bigger.

Vultures may be captured with [[cage]] [[trap]]s and [[Animal trainer|trained]] into low-value pets. They lay a very low amount of [[egg]]s, making them poor targets for [[egg production]] unless the player is doing it for novelty's sake. [[Butcher]]ing a vulture yields far more than a buzzard however, with them being large enough to give products beyond [[skull]]s.

Some [[dwarves]] [[Preferences|like]] vultures for their ''patience''.
