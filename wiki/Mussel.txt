'''Mussels''' are a source of [[food]] for fortresses located near any body of water, except [[murky pool]]s. They are also one of the few types of creatures, along with [[oyster]]s, [[cave lobster]]s, [[nautilus]]es, and [[turtle]]s, that are sources of [[shell]]s. They can't be [[butcher]]ed, but can be [[fish cleaning|cleaned]] at a [[fishery]], which generates a shell and a prepared mussel, or cooked whole (as a "raw mussel") or live (as a "live mussel"), which loses the shell.

Mussels are [[hateable]] [[vermin]] and will give unhappy [[thought]]s to dwarves who absolutely detest mussels when they encounter them.

Some [[dwarves]] [[Preferences|like]] mussels for their ''beauty''.
