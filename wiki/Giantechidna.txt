A larger version of the [[echidna]] which elves will sometimes bring to trade. Like its smaller counterpart, a giant echidna will lay an [[egg]] in a [[nest box]]. Their clutch size is 1, so breeding them can take a while. They cannot be trained into war or hunting animals.

== Bugs ==
If a curled-up or retracted creature dies, and is then reanimated by a necromancer, it retains the effects of being curled-up, but can move and attack as normal. As a result, for example an undead echidna is invulnerable to destruction{{bug|11463}}. It combines well with a separate bug that allows curled-up undead to attack{{bug|10519}}.

As a result, the undead echidna may at the same time be curled-up (making it unkillable) and move/attack. The same problem also affects the [[echidna man]], [[giant echidna]], [[giant hedgehog]] and [[hedgehog man]].

Modding the game and removing [PREVENTS_PARENT_COLLAPSE] from the spine body part of the affected animals will allow them to be pulped and killed while curled up. While it makes normal echidnas weaker, this is not a major problem, as echidnas are not supposed to be really hard to kill. This workaround [http://www.bay12forums.com/smf/index.php?topic=175473.msg8111524#msg8111524 may restore otherwise unplayable games].

It was also reported that in adventure mode "I was able to finally kill the zombie by lighting fires underneath him/around him then waiting for a long time; eventually he 'died in the heat.'"{{bug|10519}}.
