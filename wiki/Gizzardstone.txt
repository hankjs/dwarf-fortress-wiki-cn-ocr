[[File:gizzard_stone_sprite_preview.png|right]][[Image:gizzardstone.jpg|thumb|200px|right|Native gold gizzard stone.]]A '''gizzard stone''' is a rock obtainable by [[butcher]]ing or slaughtering specific [[animal]]s, usually large birds or reptiles. Gizzard stones are treated as cut [[stone]] [[gem]]s, suitable for [[encrust]]ing goods and furniture. The [[material]] of the gem is a randomly selected type of [[stone]], and may include materials not otherwise available on the map. Not all [[creature]]s with a [[gizzard]] [[body parts|body part]] drop gizzard stones when butchered, however. 

Creatures that drop gizzard stones on butchering:

*[[Alligator]]s and [[giant alligator]]s
*[[Beak dog]]s
*[[Cave crocodile]]s
*[[Elk bird]]s
*[[Jabberer]]s
*[[Ostrich]]es and [[giant ostrich]]es
*[[Saltwater crocodile]]s and [[giant saltwater crocodile]]s
*[[Roc]]s

All of these animals can be [[Animal Training|tame]]d and bred as part of your [[meat industry]], and the gizzard stones can then be used in your [[gem industry]].

== In real life ==
Gizzard stones, also known as [[wikipedia:Gastrolith|gastrolith]]s, are rocks or sand in the digestive tract to help grind up food, serving in that role instead of teeth. Animals that use gastroliths for digestion often have a special muscular stomach, called the gizzard. Gastroliths are particularly common in birds and reptiles, which lack appropriate teeth for grinding food, but they're also found in seals, sea lions, fish, and invertebrates. In aquatic animals, the stones can also serve as ballast.
