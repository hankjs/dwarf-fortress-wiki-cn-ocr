''For information on the selection and training of hunting animals, see [[animal trainer]].''

Animals with the {{token|TRAINABLE|c}} or {{token|TRAINABLE_HUNTING|c}} [[creature token]] can be trained for hunting by an [[animal trainer]]. Trained '''hunting animals''' gain speed, agility, and possibly ambusher and observer bonuses. Once trained, they can be assigned to follow specific [[hunter]]s and accompany them when hunting.
