'''Antmen''' are one of the many [[Creature|races]] of underground tribal [[animal people]] found living in small groups on any [[cavern]] level. They can be thought of as humanoid versions of the common [[ant]], but are not formed in the way of most [[animal people]] as variations of their base creatures. The antman is more like the [[serpent man]], [[reptile man]], [[amphibian man]], and [[rodent man]] in this regard.

Antmen form worker, soldier, drone and queen castes. Antmen workers are the most common antmen, no larger than a [[kobold]]. The all-male drones are the same size as workers and are additionally capable of flight. Soldiers can grow to be almost as large as a [[dwarf]]. The queen, as big as a [[lion]], is the only breeding female among antmen. Oddly enough, Antmen queens give live birth instead of laying eggs.

Despite being labelled as hostile in the unit list, antmen initially found in the caverns will ignore your citizens unless provoked. They will usually be observed carrying wooden [[spear]]s, [[blowgun]]s and [[shield]]s, although they are sometimes seen using metal items instead. These can range from [[copper]] to [[steel]], and are presumably caused by a bug. Depending on which other subterranean creatures they have access to, their [[blowdart]]s will be covered in different [[syndrome|poisons]], which can vary from mildly annoying [[cave spider]] venom to highly [[fun|dangerous]] [[giant cave spider]] toxins. You can preemptively check for poisons by selecting a [[blowgunner]], looking in their items tab and viewing their blowdarts.

<!--Antmen may launch [[ambush|group attacks]] on your fort. When this happens, all tribesmen on the map will become hostile, even if they were peaceful minutes prior to the invasion. They may arrive with [[pet]]s and [[mount]]s, some of which will be able to fly or easily catch up to your fleeing civilians. These invaders, unlike their above-ground counterparts, will not leave after some time has passed, even if your fort is completely sealed off from the caverns, nor will they prevent migrants, caravans or other invaders from arriving; including more waves of antmen. Because of this, several unchallenged assaults from them can quickly cause your game's FPS to drop to single-digit levels, thus making your fort completely unplayable.

Compared to most humanoids, antmen have an extremely short lifespan, allowing a patient player to simply wait for them to die of old age rather than confront them. As previously mentioned, antmen drones can fly, meaning that they will be able to fly over your walls, or through gaps in your floors and ceilings, so plan your defenses accordingly. This can also make them marginally harder to hit than other creatures of their size.

Some dwarves [[Preferences|like]] antmen for their ''mystery''.

{{D for Dwarf}} 
Although Antmen do not appear to have any notable writing system, humans frequently attempt to get their signatures, citing them as being some sort of great heroes. Records on their supposed escapades are found solely in human codices, often pitted against some sort of Beeman. To date, no Beemen have been discovered by dwarf-kind. Additionally, many humans believe that antmen are capable of shrinking. No evidence of this has been discovered, either.
