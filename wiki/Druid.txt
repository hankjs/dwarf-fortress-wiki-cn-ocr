Druid refers to both an unused skill and a noble position.

== Skill ==
'''Nature''' is a [[skill]] that does not normally appear in ''Dwarf Fortress''. It only exists in the raws as the {{token|MAGIC_NATURE|skill}} token, implying use in [[magic]]. As such, it is sometimes used as an [[Mod skill|extra skill]] by [[Modding|modders]]. However, it has no associated [[labor]]s so it cannot be switched off.

Though a unit's character sheet lists creatures as being a "Dabbling Druid" (and so on), there is no associated [[Unit type token|unit type]] and this name cannot be changed by {{token|PROFESSION_NAME}}.

== Noble ==
'''Druids''' are also a position of nobility among the [[elf|elves]], responsible for [[religion]] and the worship of [[force]]s. Despite sharing a name, they do not possess the Druid skill. Because they are foreign rulers, druids will not normally visit and cannot be appointed in an unmodded game of [[Fortress mode]].

Druids have the highest precedence in the elven civilization, the same as the dwarven [[monarch]]. The game treats them as the ''de jure'' ruler - in [[Legends]], or if modded to be playable, on the [[embark]] screen and for "[[mountainhome]]" purposes. However, they are not directly responsible for [[civilization|government]] affairs. Instead, they select both the [[Monarch|queen]], the ''de facto'' leader, and the princess, who functions as a [[general]]. They are succeeded by the [[acolyte]] position, which they appoint. This allows druids to choose their intended successor.

If all the acolytes are killed, and then the druid is also killed, before he had the chance to appoint a new acolyte, they remain extinct. The elven civilisation is then doomed, because there is no druid to appoint a new queen when she dies. And thus any other positions can also no longer be filled with new candidates.{{verify}}
