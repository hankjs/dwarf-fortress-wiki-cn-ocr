'''Training weapons''' are [[Edge|edgeless]] [[Wood|wooden]] [[Weapon|weapons]] created at a [[carpenter's workshop]]. There are three kinds available; axes, spears, and swords.

[[Dwarves]] won't harm each other (or themselves) during [[combat drills]], or [[Training#Sparring_and_demonstration|sparring]] while using [[Metal|metal weapons]], so training weapons are only useful when you have no metal weapon of the kind you'd like your soldiers to train with, and in a few specific circumstances.

Training weapons are virtually useless in [[combat]], so make sure that your soldiers have exchanged them for real weapons before sending them into battle, even if it means using a weapon they are totally unfamiliar with. Their utter uselessness can prove useful for [[live training]], however.

Note that soldiers equipped with training weapons for extended periods of time can grow [[Attachment|attached]] to their worthless wooden weapons. Congratulations - you now have a legendary stick.

Training weapons may also be used as non-lethal equipment for your [[fortress guard]], to avoid them [[Fun|seriously wounding or killing]] [[Justice#Crimes|criminals]], including [[Mandate|mandate violators]]. Though it is unclear how often this happens in ''Dwarf Fortress'' v50.

Training axes cannot be used for [[Wood cutter|cutting down trees]].
