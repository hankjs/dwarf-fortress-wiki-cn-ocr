[[File:wealth_preview.png|right]]Your '''created wealth''' is the sum product of all the labors of your fortress. It is visible on the [[Status#Fortress name and status|wealth tooltip]]* once you have a [[broker]] with the [[appraisal]] [[skill]] and a [[bookkeeper]] maintaining your records, and will update with the continual maintenance of your [[stocks]] by the bookkeeper.

: ''(* On the left of the bar at the top of your screen is your basic fortress info, its name and size. Mouse-hovering over this area reveals the wealth tooltip, a basic breakdown of the fortress' [[wealth]].)

Wealth is the sum of everything of [[value]] in your fortress: basically, everything except corpses and remains, which have absolutely no worth whatsoever. This includes [[stone]]s, [[building]]s, engravings, and any and every kind of created good, all of which contribute to your total wealth to various degrees. [[Artifact]]s are usually one of the largest influences on fortress wealth. Artifacts made of precious resources and heavily [[decorate]]d can easily be worth thrice the value of the rest of your fortress in the early years.

The display of your wealth on the main status screen is broken up into several categories: [[weapon]]s, [[armor]] and [[Clothing|garb]], [[furniture]], other objects (like [[finished goods]]), architecture ([[building]]s, [[constructions]], [[engravings]] and such), [[Display furniture|displayed]], and held/worn (items created internally that have been claimed by dwarves, like clothing).

For the more abstract wealth count, used in [[world generation]] to determine building ownership and help ground various acts of corruption and [[villain]]y, see [[account]].

== Imports and exports ==

Items made off-site are not counted in your total fortress wealth, and are instead listed as imports. This only applies so long as the object is unchanged; a decorated imported object will be made your own, and its value will be moved from imports to wealth. This is important when trading with caravans, as they will not accept goods stolen or lost by a previous caravan of that civilization. It is listed under "Imported Wealth".

Similarly, items made in the fortress that leave the map on a [[caravan]], be it dwarven, elven, human or goblin, are counted as exports, listed under "Exported Wealth."

== Influences ==
Wealth influences various game features, some of them good, some of them bad.

On the plus side, it increases the amount of [[migrant]]s you get per wave. Assuming that you are equipped to handle the new dwarves, this is usually a good thing, except when you are producing so much wealth that your migrant arrivals outstrip your ability to house and feed them or give them useful things to do. Drowning in migrants is a very real danger; make sure you are always equipped with surplus beds and food.

A certain level of exports and overall wealth is required to acquire economically-linked [[holding]]s. However for smaller sites fortress wealth is the more important factor in determining economic linkage. Also it is required to go up the [[noble]] ladder: a [[baron]] requires 100k of wealth and 10k of exported, a [[count]] 200k and 20k, a [[duke]] 300k and 30k. The [[monarch]] has some fairly complicated requirements based on a few different categories.

On the negative side, more wealth attracts more attacks. At first, this will be an above-average amount of [[thief|thieves]], but as the game progresses and your wealth continues to grow, this will develop into [[ambush]]es, [[siege]]s, and visits from [[megabeast]]s, all of which are attracted to increasing amounts of wealth. This keeps the game from being boring, but too much [[fun]] is also a bad thing; if you have a hard time dealing with the numerous waves of immigrants, you're probably not equipped to deal with a full-on siege.

== Building and limiting wealth==
Building wealth is simple - just commit more people to useful industries and continue growing. You will want to establish a major [[industry]] and commit a dwarf to it (producing [[finished goods]] is the easiest way), allowing you to spend grand sums on caravans and get everything you absolutely need quickly and painlessly. If you intend to go this route, be sure to create tons of extra [[bin]]s to ease the transfer of items to the trade depot and prevent stockpiles from becoming too full.

When first starting out, it's typically best to not focus too much on building wealth until you have an effective military that can deal with the [[Megabeast|fun]] [[Werebeasts|things]] that a large amount of wealth can cause.  However, in your first year you probably do want to create goods to be able to [[trade]] with the autumn dwarven [[caravan]], in order to obtain goods that are not available at your location, or that you cannot produce yet. A simple way to create a few thousand ☼ without much effort is to [[cook]] a surplus of [[lavish meal]]s. Don't sell meals to the [[Elf|Elves]], though, as many ingredients, and the wooden barrel in which the meals are stored, are [[Trading#Unacceptable_items|unacceptable]] to them.

[[Metal]]s are great materials for creating wealth.  Many locations have an [[ore]] of [[iron]] or [[silver]]. Both are of moderate value and can be made into [[weapon]]s, [[furniture]] or crafts.  [[Statue]]s make for high-value furniture.  Certain butchered [[animal]]s have high-value bones or skulls.  [[Ceramic]]s, especially [[stoneware]] made from [[fire clay]] can provide a continuous source of decent valued goods.  Rough [[gem]]s can be hard to find but a highly skilled [[gem setter]] can decorate objects to add considerable value to furniture or crafts.

On the opposite side, there are the fortresses that would much rather establish a baseline of sorts before embarking on an expansionist binge - getting a full defensive grid up, for instance, or penetrating an [[aquifer]] without having to waste precious reserves on more dwarves and more enemies. These players concentrate on low-value activities like carpentry, masonry, and mining, and only produce enough trade goods to get what is necessary from the caravans. Although they are slower to grow, they also afford their players more time to plan and to lay the groundwork for the future of the fortress. 

Note that, no matter what, you ''will'' have to deal with ''some'' growth - besides the natural expansion of your fortress, there's also the issue of [[artifact]]s. Do what you will, but every once in a while a dwarf will [[Strange mood|claim a workshop]] and produce a valuable trinket, and all you can hope for is that it's not worth too much.  It's worth noting that artifact furniture is counted three separate times toward created wealth: as furniture, as architecture, and as displayed.  You may wish to hold off on installing that legendary [[coffer]] that's worth three times as much as your fortress when just sitting in a stockpile.

Most players choose to walk the middle line, getting together the necessary industries, but concentrating on the [[metal industry]] early on, to get together their arms and armor. Although [[steel]] is worth its weight in [[gold]], it is much more useful deflecting goblin arrows from your fortress defenders than as a [[statue]] decorating your [[Meeting area|lobby]].

==Bugs==

*Some buggy items can have a negative wealth. This can cause expected events to not happen, as they are tied to wealth. To troubleshoot this, you can move all your items to the trade depot and look through the value of the items.  You may want to do this on a backed-up save. Once you find the offending item, you can either atom-smash it or use DFHACK "autodump destroy".
