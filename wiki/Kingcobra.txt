'''King cobras''' are small [[Creature|animals]], weighing a tenth as much as the average adult [[dwarf]] upon reaching maturity, which makes them roughly the same size as their real life counterparts. They can be found roaming about by themselves in [[tropical]] [[forest]]s. If threatened, they can bite and deliver a [[syndrome]] which causes paralysis, severe localized pain, dizziness, and drowsiness. The paralysis by itself may be enough to kill a dwarf due to suffocation.

King cobras can be captured in [[cage]] [[trap]]s and [[Animal trainer|trained]] into exotic [[pet]]s of decent value. They are born adults and as such can't be fully tamed. While too small to give worthy returns if [[butcher]]ed, they are prolific [[egg]]-layers, and as such make good targets for [[egg production]]. Products made from king cobra parts are [[Item value|worth]] twice more than those made from common animals.

Some dwarves [[Preferences|like]] king cobras for their ''charming hood''.
