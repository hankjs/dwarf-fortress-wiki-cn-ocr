'''Liar''' is a [[social skill]] used by dwarves while [[socializing]]. Dwarves that are particularly good at this tend to make friends easily and will often rise to [[mayor|mayoral]] positions. 

To train this skill, create a meeting area and let dwarves idle; dwarves idling near each other will chatter amongst themselves. Only dwarves that do not value the [[Personality value#TRUTH|truth]] gain [[experience]] in this skill.
