'''Cap hoppers''' are a species of subterranean, amphibious [[vermin]] [[creature]]s that live in the first and second layers of the [[cavern]]s. They can be captured by [[trapper]]s and turned into [[pet]]s, and are otherwise unremarkable. All cap hoppers possess Legendary [[skill]] in [[Climber|climbing]].

Some [[Dwarf|dwarves]] [[Preferences|like]] cap hoppers for their ''swinging antics''.
