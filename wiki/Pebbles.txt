[[File:pebble_tiles.png|thumb|113px|right|Shale pebble tiles surrounded by grass.]]'''Pebbles''' are a naturally-occurring [[map tile]] found commonly across the surface of the world near [[river]]s and [[brook]]s, and occasionally on [[beach]]es. They are the same stone type as the substrate; for example, if the first stone layer beneath [[soil]] is [[basalt]], then pebbles will be composed of basalt. Pebbles may be found near [[boulder]]s of the same substrate.

Unlike [[boulder]]s, pebbles cannot be designated for [[smoothing]]. (This may be a bug)

In [[adventurer mode]], a pebble tile is an unlimited source of small rocks, which can be useful for [[Thrower|throwing]] and [[Knapper|knapping]].
