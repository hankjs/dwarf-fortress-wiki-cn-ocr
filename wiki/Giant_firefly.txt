'''Giant fireflies''' are the giant version of [[Firefly|fireflies]] that appear in [[savage]] biomes. They get to about the size of a [[grizzly bear]] and stay that size their whole lives. They are generally benign but will cancel work orders and occasionally attack your dwarves if provoked. All giant fireflies are born with legendary [[skill]] in [[climbing]] and as full sized adults.

Giant fireflies can be caught in [[cage trap]]s and [[Animal trainer|trained]] into exotic [[Pet|pets]] with the standard pet value of 500. However, they don't live that long and are difficult to breed, so they aren't a great choice of pet. They do [[butcher]] into a decent amount of [[meat]] and [[fat]] each, however. Since they are exotic [[Mount|mounts]] they can spawn as mounts during [[elf]] [[siege]]s.

Some dwarves [[Preferences|like]] giant fireflies for their ''enchanting glow''.
