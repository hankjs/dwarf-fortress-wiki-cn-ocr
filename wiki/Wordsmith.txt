'''Wordsmith''' is a [[skill]] which affects the quality of the writer's prose. Experience in Wordsmith is gained from writing and composing any verse, whether written or not. Wordsmith affects the artistry of these works, as well as how clearly the writer's personality comes across. This is more important to expressive and speculative works than [[Writer]].
