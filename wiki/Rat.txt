'''Rats''' are a type of [[hateable]] [[vermin]] found in any area that isn't [[biome|freezing]]. They like to consume your fortress's [[food]], [[bone]]s, and [[shell]]s, and may inspire unhappy [[thought]]s in any dwarves that encounter them. They sometimes appear in large swarms, and are automatically hunted by [[cat]]s. They can be captured by [[trapper]]s and turned into [[pet]]s, but care should be taken if doing that while possessing rat-hating dwarves among your population.

Some dwarves [[Preferences|like]] rats for their ''friendliness'', their ''playfulness'', their ''curiosity'' and their ''intelligence''.

<!-- Reference: "Ratatouille" animated film featuring a rat that controlled a soup chef to cook -->
When a rat becomes a pet, it has a very low chance of getting the legendary cooking skill, and will puppet its owner by pulling the hair of their owner's beard. Doing this will allow it to cook more efficiently while not gaining any suspicion.

<!-- Reference: ??? -->
It is believed that there is a giant rat that makes all the rules for smaller rats.
