'''Beetles''' are a type of unremarkable [[above ground]] [[vermin]] found anywhere that isn't [[biome|freezing]], and may not be caught in [[animal trap]]s. Despite having wings, they are flightless (a comment on their raws says it's to allow them to crawl around instead). All beetles possess Legendary [[skill]] in [[Climber|climbing]].

Some dwarves [[Preferences|like]] beetles for their ''protective shells''.

{{D for Dwarf}}
Some other dwarves like beetles for their ''music'' and their ''cheapness''.
