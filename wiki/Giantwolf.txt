'''Giant wolves''' are just what the name implies; bigger, meaner versions of the normal [[wolf]], much larger than a [[polar bear]]. They can only appear in the [[savage]] [[biome]] types of [[tundra]], [[taiga]], temperate [[forest]], or temperate [[shrubland]].

Some dwarves [[Preferences|like]] giant wolves for their ''cunning''.

==Adventure mode==
These animals aren't nearly as common as [[giant dingo|giant dingoes]], but they almost always come in packs. Be careful with these animals, for a number of them can easily dispatch a poorly equipped adventurer. If a [[stray]] [[tame]] one is encountered, either at a player fortress or rarely at [[elven]] [[site]]s, they can be ridden.

==Fortress mode==
In fortress mode, these animals can be tamed as a bigger [[dog]] replacement, though they cannot be trained for war or hunting. Be careful to not let unarmed civilians too close to wild ones, else they will likely be killed.
