==In Real Life==

Once a staple food of the Aztecs, blood amaranth has a long history of cultivation in Central America as a grain. Its seeds are edible as a porridge, and its leaves can be eaten like [[spinach]]. While some decorative varieties have purple leaves, the name comes primarily from the deep maroon color of the plant's flowers.
