'''Shapes''' are a particular type of descriptor present within the game. They are used in the following areas:

* [[Preference]]s - along with materials, creatures, and plants, dwarves can also like certain shapes.
* [[Image]]s - used in [[engraving]]s and [[decoration]]s, most simple images (not depicting historical events) will simply depict a shape, generally one of the ones preferred by the engraver.
* Cut [[gem]]s - cut gems (and stones) can have a particular shape. [[Gizzard stone]]s are treated as a specific type of gem cut.
* [[Dice]] - dice come in different shapes, both as platonic solids and as polygonal prisms (long dice).
