'''Harpies''' are [[fanciful]], intelligent, female-only [[creature]]s found in many [[evil]] [[biome]]s. They spawn in flocks of 2-3 mayhem-minded individuals who will terrorize pastured livestock and attack [[dwarves]] who get in their sights (or at least are supposed to, but currently don't {{bug|10031}}). Harpies are as heavy as the average dwarf and can cause severe damage to civilians, though they should pose no real threat to a squad of [[Crossbowman|marksdwarves]] and even less to a metal-clad melee squad, provided they can hit and reach them. Harpies are immortal and only die to violence and disease.

Harpies possess a [[pet]] value of 30, but lack the necessary tokens to be [[Animal trainer|trainable]] (and even if [[Modding|modded]] to be trainable, the fact they are intelligent creatures will lead to [[Animal trainer#Taming_intelligent_creatures|strange behavior]]). Due to the aforementioned intelligence, dwarves will not [[butcher]], eat or use products made from harpies, limiting their use to occupying space in your [[refuse]] [[stockpile]], [[live training]] or putting them somewhere of your liking if you capture one in a [[cage]] [[trap]].

Some dwarves [[Preferences|like]] harpies for their ''feathery wings'' and their ''fearsome talons''.

==Trivia==
*Initially, the premium version had a sprite for a child harpy, which like most other child graphics of the time, was just a smaller version of the adult sprite. The harpy child sprite was later removed from the game in 50.08 with the overhaul of child graphics. The player is unlikely to encounter a harpy child except by [[modding]] the creature or using [[DFHack]] to change the profession of one to a child. And if the player ''does'' encounter a child harpy, it will now appear invisible in the premium graphics due to it still defining a child graphic which now points to a blank tile. Although harpies do not have a baby form, a baby harpy will instead default to the adult sprite since no baby sprite is defined for them.<br>
