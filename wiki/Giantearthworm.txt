'''Giant earthworms''' are massive and fairly rare [[worm]]s found in the first and second layers of the [[cavern]]s. As heavy as a [[grizzly bear]], these [[creature]]s will attack [[Dwarf|dwarves]] who provoke them with [[push]] attacks, and they are large enough for such attacks to cause heavy damage to unarmored [[peasant]]s.

Giant earthworms have a [[Pet#Pet value|pet value]] of 500, but lack the necessary tokens to be [[Animal trainer|trainable]]. They give a significant amount of returns when [[butcher]]ed, and products made from them are twice as valuable as products made with normal animal parts, making giant earthworm hunting a profitable decision for a fortress.

They can't be spawned in the [[object testing arena]].

Some dwarves [[Preferences|like]] giant earthworms for their ''awesome presence''.

<!-- Reference: Earthworm Jim video game series -->
[[Legends]] tell of an intelligent giant earthworm in ☼masterwork☼ armor traversing the stars with his [[puppy]] friend. Some of his [[adventure]]s include racing an intelligent [[crow]], traversing the [[circus]] domain of an [[evil]] [[cat]], and fighting a [[scholar]] with a [[monkey]] for a [[head]].

<!-- Reference: Penumbra video game series -->
Despite popular belief, giant earthworms will not exist within the foundation of science research centers in Greenland during 2000 and 2001. They are also not known as "grey rock worms". They are also not infected (nor worshiped) by a mythological hive-mind known as "The Tuurngait".

<!-- Reference: Lethal Company -->
They will also not approach unsuspecting workers from the bottom of outside terrain, nor will they attempt to swallow them whole. There is a myth regarding such worms attacking workers that "travel to different moons to collect scrap metal". Dwarven [[scholar]]s have confirmed that this is only a myth, and nothing more.
