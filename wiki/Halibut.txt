'''Halibuts''' are a species of [[Creature|fish]] who can be found in [[temperate]] and [[arctic]] [[ocean]]s. Over three times heavier than a [[dwarf]], they provide a good amount of returns when [[butcher]]ed. As non-[[vermin]] fish, halibuts can't be fished by [[Fisherdwarf|fisherdwarves]], but can be caught with the use of a [[drowning chamber]]. Infant halibuts are called ''halibut fry''.

Some dwarves [[Preferences|like]] halibuts for their ''fins''.
