'''Giant lions''' are strong, carnivorous animals found in savage tropical areas. They often appear in small hunting groups of 2-3 animals. Giant lions are much larger than many other "giant" creatures, growing to more than 8 times the size of a regular [[lion]], or slightly more than 1/3 the size of an [[elephant]]. Occasionally, giant lions may appear as [[mount]]s during a [[siege]]. Their chief advantage over the larger [[giant tiger]] and [[giant polar bear]] is their much greater [[gait|speed]].

Giant lions can be captured and tamed by an [[animal trainer]]. Although they have a rather low pet value (''of 500, to be exact''), their [[butcher]]ing products are 4 times as valuable as common animals. Once tamed, they may also be trained for hunting or war. Because of their value, size, and utility, giant lions can prove quite useful to your fortress if you can secure a breeding pair. 

Curiously, dwarves only [[preference|admire]] giant lions for their ''roars''.
