'''Leopard seal men''' are [[animal people]] variants of the common [[leopard seal]] who can be found in [[savage]] [[arctic]] [[ocean]]s. They spawn in groups of 1-5 individuals and while not too aggressive, will fight back if provoked. In terms of size, they are almost four times larger than a [[dwarf]] and will overpower an untrained civilian very quickly if angered.

Like other savage animal people, they can join [[civilization]]s, become [[historical figure]]s, appear as [[visitor]]s and be playable in [[adventurer mode]].

Some dwarves [[Preferences|like]] leopard seal men for their ''fierce nature''.

Leopard seal men are relatively unimportant in the world of ''Dwarf Fortress'', but then along came Bim Silversnarl the Hero of Balance, a demigod leopard seal man adventurer whose journey has bloomed to legendary proportions. A true display of pinniped potential, he built his own settlement and recruited an entourage of loyal [[honey badger man|honey badger men]] who unquestionably follow their natural born leader. In his quest to "balance" and abate the overgrown [[goblin|evil]] in the world, Bim was responsible for the slaughter of over 700 trolls ''en masse'' during a visit to the dark fortress. Blood the color of adamantine was spilled in great abundance; the carnage was so unchecked that his iron battle axe and long sword actually wore out from endlessly beating them against troll flesh. [[Armok]] would be proud, and on the plus side, lag was reduced considerably. An [http://www.deviantart.com/art/Bim-Silversnarl-Hero-of-Balance-672284578 ☼engraving of Bim Silversnarl☼] was carved in honor of the extraordinary mammal. Leopard seals do indeed have a ''fierce nature'', after all. The video series chronicling his epic adventure can be found [http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e2JXgQxiDYo&list=PLXX7Rp0iXj0klmNiJH79gzGAsdI0BHvm8 here].
