'''Hare men''' are [[animal people]] variants of the common [[hare]] who can be found in [[savage]] [[temperate]] [[grassland]]s and [[savanna]]s. They spawn in groups of 1-5 individuals and are generally content to keep to themselves. In terms of size, they are a little over half the weight of the average [[dwarf]].

Like other savage animal people, they can join [[civilization]]s, become [[historical figure]]s, appear as [[visitor]]s and be playable in [[adventurer mode]].

Some dwarves [[Preferences|like]] hare men for their ''long ears'' and ''fluffy tails''.

<!-- Reference: Bugs Bunny -->
Some '''hare men''' are known to fool hunters with their wit and guile, they also have a penchant for wisecracks and munching on carrots. Even during "rabbit season".

<!-- Reference: Zootopia -->
One case reports an ambitious hare woman becoming a citizen of a dwarven fortress and ascending the ranks until she became a guard, while also getting a pardon for a [[fox man]] and letting him join.
