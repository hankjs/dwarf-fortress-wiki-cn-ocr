'''Dralthas''' are massive [[creature]]s who dwell on the first and second [[Caverns|underground]] layers. They don't actively seek fights but are huge creatures—about half the weight of an [[elephant]]—and able to kill a [[dwarf]] with ease, often ripping them in half in the process. It is advisable to herd them into [[cage]] [[trap]]s, or keep dwarves away from them if they make their way into commonly used pathways, as they will attack if dwarves brush by them enough.

Once captured, dralthas can be trained with an [[animal trainer]], and have a high [[pet]] value of 500. Draltha products are worth three times as much as those from [[domestic animal]]s, and they are common enough to make capturing a herd for breeding easy.  Their large size means they produce a good amount of meat and bones when butchered. Keep in mind that they are grazing creatures, which require a [[pasture]] in order to survive once trained. Because of their size, each will need a fairly large pasture.

Unlike most animals, dralthas can't be spawned in the [[object testing arena]].

Some dwarves [[Preferences|like]] dralthas for their ''lustrous manes''.
