'''Brook lampreys''' are an aquatic [[vermin]] found year-round in nearly any [[temperate]] body of [[water]], and are a ready source of [[food]] when [[fish cleaning|cleaned]] at a [[fishery]]. These should not be confused with the [[sea lamprey]], a large (and potentially dangerous) fish.

Some [[dwarves]] [[Preferences|like]] brook lampreys for their ''beauty''.
