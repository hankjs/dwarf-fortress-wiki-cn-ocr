[[Historical figure|Legendary beings]], such as an [[ettin]], associated with the [[Sphere|spheres]] of art, beauty, dance, love, marriage, music, painting, poetry, song, or speech will have words from this symbol in their name.

Alongside [[Language SYM.txt/Freedom|FREEDOM]], [[Language SYM.txt/Good|GOOD]], and [[Language SYM.txt/Peace|PEACE]], and [[Language SYM.txt/Truth|TRUTH]], FLOWERY is one of the possible [[Entity token#SUBSELECT_SYMBOL|subsymbols]] available to [[Surroundings#Good|good biomes]].

[[Elf|Elves]] particularly [[Entity token#SELECT_SYMBOL|value]] this symbol (as well as [[Language SYM.txt/Nature|NATURE]]) and will include [[Elven language|words]] from it to name citizens, sites and governments.

Other [[Entity|cultures]], among them [[Dwarf|dwarves]] and [[Goblin|goblins]], [[Entity token#CULL_SYMBOL|don't use]] words from this symbol for their names.

Most [[Performer|art forms]] are considered FLOWERY, and thus are named using words from this symbol. Some forms, such as ribald poetry, use [[Language SYM.txt/Domestic|DOMESTIC]] instead.
