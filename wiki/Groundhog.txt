'''Groundhogs''' are small [[Creature|animals]] found in [[temperate]] plains, in groups of 1-4 individuals. Smaller than [[cat]]s, they're benign meanderers who do little but wander around aimlessly, being easy prey for your [[hunter]]s. They possess thick fur which provides them with increased insulation compared to most other animals, and their newborns are referred to as ''pups''. They won't appear during the [[winter]], mimicking real-life hibernation.

Groundhogs can be captured in [[cage]] [[trap]]s and [[Animal trainer|trained]] into exotic [[pet]]s. They give few products when [[butcher]]ed, making them poor targets for a [[meat industry]]. Trained groundhogs are [[grazer]]s and as such need a [[pasture]] in order to not starve.

Some dwarves [[Preferences|like]] groundhogs for their ''ability to burrow''.

<!-- Reference: Groundhog Day, Punxsutawney Phil -->
In certain northern temperate lands, some humans think these little fuzzy creatures can predict the arrival of spring by the sight of their shadow.  Most dwarves discredit this, but with almost 100% predictability, some humans, and a few dwarves will worship them, especially if the object of worship is named Phil.
