'''Raccoons''' are small and somewhat rare [[Creature|animals]] found in [[taiga]]s and [[temperate]] [[forest]]s, where they appear in loose groups of 1-3 individuals. Slightly larger than the average [[cat]], they'll attempt to [[Thief|steal]] both your [[Steals food|food]] and your [[Steals items|items]], making them a severe annoyance to a fortress during its infancy. Keep them out of your [[stockpile]]s and ensure your goods are taken underground if you embark in a map inhabited by raccoons. In combat, raccoons will defend themselves if attacked but generally stand no chance against a [[dwarf]] due to their small size. They possess thick fur which provides them with increased insulation compared to most other animals, and are also born with Legendary [[skill]] in [[Climber|climbing]]. Young raccoons are called ''pups''.

Raccoons can be captured in [[cage]] [[trap]]s and [[Animal trainer|trained]] into exotic [[pet]]s. They possess low value and provide few returns when [[butcher]]ed due to their small size, making them subpar targets for a [[meat industry]]. Due to not being benign, they'll fight intruders they come across, which makes them potential meat shields for your civilians.

Some dwarves [[Preferences|like]] raccoons for their ''mischief''.

==Real Life==

Though young raccoons are called “pups” in ''Dwarf Fortress'', in real life they are called kits.
