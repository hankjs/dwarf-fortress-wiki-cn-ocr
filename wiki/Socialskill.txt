[[File:speech_preview.png|right]]'''Social skills''' are used mainly by the [[expedition leader]], [[mayor]] and [[broker]] in interactions between the [[dwarves]] in your fortress, as well as when talking with [[liaison]]s, [[diplomat]]s, and [[merchant]]s. Social skills can be acquired at embark, while performing various administrative tasks, or while socializing in a [[tavern]]. The starting dwarf with the most [[social skill]]s will almost always become the [[expedition leader]], who will automatically become your first [[mayor]], so when giving social skills to your starting dwarves, don't give them to one whose [[preferences]] will lead to obnoxious [[mandate]]s upon becoming mayor.

The following list is based on the skills listed in the nobles screen when replacing a [[noble]].

==List of social skills==
=== Conversational skills ===
Social skills are trained at the tavern, during a conversation between two or more idle dwarves, and when [[trading]]. They are also listed as mayor skills.
{{Skill Box|Social|5:0|5:0|
* [[Conversationalist]]
* [[Comedian]]
* [[Flatterer]]
* [[Judge of intent]]
* [[Liar]]
* Intimidator
* [[Persuader]]
* Negotiator
* [[Consoler]]
* Pacifier}}

There are 7 different types of conversations, each with their own skill sets. Creatures will use whichever skills are available to them (based on their [[personality facet]]s), and if ''no'' skills are available, they will use Negotiation regardless. Skills which are especially relevant will have their skill rolls multiplied (by the number of checkmarks shown), and ones which are less relevant (marked with "x") will be cut in half.

===Broker skills===
The "haggle" skills listed above are used in (and trained by) trading, increasing the chances of a deal being successful. [[Judge of intent]] skill is particularly important as it allows a broker to see how a trader feels about a particular deal. Note that the [[Appraiser]] skill, which is not a social skill, is also very important during the trading process. The skill is required for the player to see the monetary value of sellable items, as well as how accurately their prices can be displayed.

The "cover for gaffe" skills come into play whenever you screw up and offer the Elves something wrong - the higher your broker's skill levels, the less angry the merchants will become (and the greater your chance to be able to continue trading during that season).

===Diplomat skills===
The "discuss request" skills are useful when negotiating trade agreements, maximizing the profit you can make by selling the goods they want, and minimizing how much extra you have to pay for items you want from them. It also allows you to cut down more trees without getting the Elves angry.

===Mayor skills===
While all the conversational skills are important for a mayoral dwarf seeking reelection by making friends, dwarves with the [[Consoler]] and [[Pacifier]] skills can reduce the likelihood of tantrums by being complained at or cried on (which creates a happy thought for the other dwarf).

==Gaining social skills==
===[[Fortress mode|Fortress Mode]]===
Dwarves train their social skills when idling in meeting areas ''and'' they are standing near another dwarf. All allowed social skills train at the same rate (usually 1 exp. per social one-on-one interaction), except possibly Conversationalist for some dwarves. What social skills are allowed depends on both [[beliefs]] and [[facets]] of the particular dwarf. A typical dwarf meets all the non-override requirements except for low TRUTH, allowing all skills except Liar and Flatterer. Normally, all beliefs and all facets must meet the basic requirements. However, if any *single* facet meets the "override" requirement, all belief requirements are waived (but any other facet requirements remain). Note that beliefs range from -50 to +50, while facets range from 0 to 100.

Dwarves also train some social skills, at a much faster rate, when attending or conducting meetings, allthough only some social skills of the attending and the conducting dwarf are trained and used, ie. in case of complaining some of the trained skills are the intimidator and persuader skill (of the dwarves attending and conducting the meeting) and the consoler/pacifier skill of the dwarf conducting the meeting and the conversationalist, negotiator, judge of intend, comedian, pacifier and consoler skill of the complaining dwarf are not trained. Here the trained social skills are not raised at the same rate (ie. the intimidator skill of the complainer seems to be increased about two times as fast as the persuader skill). 

Furthermore some social skills (the ones used by the broker, except conversationalist) can be trained by letting a dwarf trade at the trade depot (see [[broker]]).

===[[Adventure mode|Adventure Mode]]===
Adventure mode characters can train some social skills by having conversations. (Oddly, Conversationalist is not one of them. {{bug|10874}}) It is unknown if [[personality facet]]s have any effect.

Judge of Intent and Persuader are trained whenever you argue a value (even if it is not your value) or press the argument. Responding with flattery trains Flatterer. Responding with dismissal trains Intimidator. Responding passively trains Pacifier.

The flatter, calm, and joke options train Flatterer, Pacifier, and Comedian, respectively. The interrogation menu options can train Persuader or Intimidator.

Social skills are important in Adventure mode, as they can let you persuade pretty much anyone into doing anything you want. This includes changing NPCs' values, persuading position holders to give up their title, enlisting you into the army, and so on.
