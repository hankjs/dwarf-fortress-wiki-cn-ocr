'''Personality facets''', as distinct from [[attributes]] and [[mannerism]]s (''as well as [[Personality value|values]] and [[Personality goal|goals]]''), can be found for a creature in the first sub-tab of the "Personality" tab of its character sheet. In general, these do not have as important a gameplay effect as attributes, though many of the gameplay effects of personality facets are as yet unknown.

Facets have an effect on which social skills are learned in social interaction, and determine whether certain actions may give a good or bad [[thought]]. Facets may have other, more subtle effects on creature behavior, which are currently not entirely understood. Like beliefs, memories may change a creature's facets over time.

Facets are also influenced by species, via the use of the PERSONALITY [[creature token]]. For example, dwarves are slightly more greedy than average, with a median of 55 in that facet, whereas goblins aren't likely to help others out – their altruism median is a mere 25, and is capped at 50.

==Measurement==

Each personality facet has a value from 0–100. The value triggers a report in the Traits personality tab depending on where it falls in any of seven levels. (The 40−60 range does not cause a report.)

{| class="wikitable" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"
! Value range !! Values in range !! Probability !! Effect|-| 91-100 || 10 || 0.4% || Highest|-| 76-90 || 15 || 2% || Very High|-| 61-75 || 15 || 8.5% || High|-| 40-60 || 21 || 78% || Neutral|-| 25-39 || 15 || 8.5% || Low|-| 10-24 || 15 || 2% || Very Low|-|  0-9 || 10 || 0.4% || Lowest|}
==Facet list==

Facets which are marked below with "†" also contribute to [[relationship]]s – values which are significantly different (i.e. greater than 60 in one creature and less than 40 in the other) will contribute toward the formation of [[grudge]]s.

Certain facets are capable of conflicting with a creature's beliefs. The effect of this is not yet known.

In addition to the verbose descriptions that appear on the Personality Traits tab, each facet can also display a brief summary phrase on the Overview tab (e.g. "Quick to love" or "Slow to love" for especially high/low values of LOVE_PROPENSITY).
