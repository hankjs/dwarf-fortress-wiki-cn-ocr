'''Pond turtle men''' are [[animal people]] variants of the common [[pond turtle]] who can be found in [[savage]] [[pool]]s. They spawn in groups of 1-3 individuals and are able to retract into their [[shell]]s when threatened, much like common turtles. In terms of size, they are a little over half the weight of the average [[dwarf]].

Currently, pond turtle men are unable to appear in game, since they spawn only in pools and ponds, and only [[vermin]] creatures can spawn inside the borders of a map, due to a [[bug]].

Some dwarves [[Preferences|like]] pond turtle men for their ''shells''.

{{D for Dwarf}}
Pond turtle men are known for their ability to count by twos and tie their shoes, despite never wearing shoes.
