''Not to be confused with the position of [[dungeon master]].''
[[File:guardian_sprite_preview.png|right]]A '''dungeon guardian''' ({{Raw Tile|ÿ|5:1}}) is a hostile [[creature]] that has been granted [[immortality]] to defend a [[mysterious dungeon]]. The name of this title varies throughout each world, and is themed after the same [[sphere]] as that world's [[primordial remnant]]. The different tiers of mysterious site each correspond to a different title, with no present mechanical difference between the various power levels.

All [[Historical figure|named]] guardians in a world are the same species, chosen from among [[Person|intelligent]] creatures. All animals from a mysterious site become guardians, as well as some non-historical [[goblin]]s in a mysterious palace.

In graphics mode, (humanoid) guardians have the same light purple skin that [[necromancer]]s have.

==Powers and traits==
In addition to immortality, the guardian [[syndrome]] adds a set of traits comparable to that of a [[necromancer]]. They do not need to eat, sleep, or drink, and cannot be blinded. They don't get [[tired]] or frightened in combat, and don't suffer fevers. Their physical [[attribute]]s are fixed and cannot increment or rust, though they generally have high stats anyway. They cannot reproduce.

Their [[personality]] is, furthermore, made incredibly hostile by the syndrome, forcing them to be maximally loveless, hateful, violent, cruel, and non-altruistic. When viewing the personalities of guardians, it is shown that they possess some positive or neutral traits, but they will always have current negative traits to mask them. When performing most tasks, they will not have many unique [[thought]]s about them, as they'll usually feel nothing, similar to an [[undead]] or [[intelligent undead]] creature.

Intelligent guardians have three separate ranks, with each tier guarding a different type of mythical site. Lair guardians have names such as "terror servant", "dread worshipper" or "nightmare worshipper". Dungeon guardians will possess names such as "fear priest", "terror shaman" or "cleric of fear". Palace guardians will have names like "nightmare lord", "lord of fear" or "master of terror". In the [[object testing arena]], when choosing what type of condition the creature can be spawned as (such as a werebeast, necromancer, etc.), three dungeon guardian choices are among them, albeit randomized.

Animal guardians have their own set of names, being given prefixes such as "dread" and "fierce". In a world with a [[Sphere#DREAMS|dreamstuff]] [[Primordial remnant|remnant]], animal guardians may be described as "sleeping" (do note their immunity to sleep).

==Equipment==
[[Mysterious dungeon]] inhabitants have access to all normal types of [[armor]] and [[weapon]]s, including [[steel]]. Dungeon guardians spawn with higher-quality equipment than their minions. They also come equipped with a [[mythical substance]] that allows them to heal from major [[wound]]s. These liquids may have names such as "odd goo" or "odd pulp".

The strongest guardian of a mysterious palace will use a procedurally-generated [[magic]] item. This often is a masterful [[primordial remnant]] weapon, though other item types exist.
