'''Shleggings''' are [[leggings]] made from [[shell]]. The name is a portmanteau of "shell" and "leggings". The name seems to originate from a live video stream of the game from 2022-11-10, a recording of which was published on the Internet here: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?t=3462&v=bLN8cOcTjdo Let's Learn Dwarf Fortress Steam Edition - EP1]. It is linked at a timestamp before [[Alexandra]] says, "shleggings".
