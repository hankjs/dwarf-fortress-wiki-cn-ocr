Despite their large size, '''giant deer''' are usually rather harmless unless cornered or [[Creature#Agitation|agitated]]. They are roughly 8 times bigger than standard [[deer]], thus they need a large [[pasture]] to survive. They can be [[tame]]d, having a decent pet value of 500 like most giant animals, but not trained, so they won't be much use for fortress defense.
