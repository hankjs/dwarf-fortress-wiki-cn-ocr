'''Giant kakapo''' are enlarged [[Creature|cousins]] of the common [[kakapo]], found in some [[savage]] [[temperate]] biomes. Despite being over 3 times bigger than a [[dwarf]], these birds are about as benign as their normal counterparts; a lone giant kakapo will occasionally appear in the map and meander around adorably, fleeing from attackers who threaten it. However, due to their larger size, [[hunter]]s who try to kill them may meet some resistance.

Giant kakapo can be captured in [[cage]] [[trap]]s and [[Animal trainer|trained]] into [[pet]]s, possessing the standard high value of a giant creature. While they aren't any better than normal kakapo when it comes to laying [[egg]]s, they actually give a decent amount of returns when [[butcher]]ed, making the idea of a giant parrot farm a viable one. Giant kakapo are exotic [[mount]]s and can be used by [[Elf|elves]] during [[siege]]s, which may not be a smart choice for them as they could've picked a bird actually capable of flight instead. 

Some dwarves [[Preferences|like]] giant kakapo for their ''longevity'', their ''flightlessness'' and their ''booming calls''.
