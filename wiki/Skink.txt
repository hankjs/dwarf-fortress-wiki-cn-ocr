'''Skinks''' are a type of [[vermin]] who can be found in a variety of regions, from [[desert]]s to any [[tropical]] and [[temperate]] [[biome]]. They can be captured by [[trapper]]s and turned into low-value [[pet]]s. All members of the species possess Legendary [[skill]] in [[Climber|climbing]].

Some [[Dwarf|dwarves]] [[Preferences|like]] skinks for their ''colorful tongues''.
