'''Emperor penguins''' are [[creature]]s found inhabiting arctic [[ocean]]s, where they spawn in groups of 5-10 individuals. Standing at half the size of a [[dwarf]], these flightless birds will run away when threatened, making them an easy target for a [[hunter]] or a [[military]] squad. [[Butcher]]ing them will return an acceptable amount of [[food]] and [[bone]]s to the fortress.

Emperor penguins possess a [[pet]] value of 10, but unlike most animals, they are not [[Animal trainer|trainable]].

Some dwarves [[Preferences|like]] emperor penguins for their ''large size'', their ''coloration'', their ''waddling gait'' and their ''way of flying through the water''.
