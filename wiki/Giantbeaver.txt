'''Giant beavers''' are the [[giant animal]] variant of the common [[beaver]], found in [[savage]] [[temperate]] [[lake]]s and [[river]]s where they appear in groups of 3-10 individuals. They are roughly five times the size of a [[dwarf]], but are generally benign and content to simply meander their territory. If confronted, however, they may fight back and make quick work out of inexperienced warriors.

Giant beavers can be captured in [[cage]] [[trap]]s and [[Animal trainer|trained]] into exotic [[pet]]s, possessing the standard giant creature value. They provide plenty of [[meat]] and [[bone]]s when [[butcher]]ed, making them useful as potential livestock. Like other giant animals, giant beavers are exotic [[mount]]s.

Some dwarves [[Preferences|like]] beavers for their ''dams'' and their ''tree-felling habits''.

==In real life==
An animal often called a 'Giant Beaver' lived in Ice Age North America. [[wikipedia:Castoroides|Castoroides]] was the size of a black bear. However, the DF Giant Beaver is much bigger than Castoroides.
