If [[Lynx]]es are rare among their climes (and trust me, [[Extinct|they are]]), then the sapient '''Lynx man''' is even rarer. Found only within [[Surroundings#Savage|savage]] [[taiga]] [[biome]]s, the lynx man lives significantly longer than their non-sapient brethren, and rarely, they can join [[Historical figure|other civilizations]] like all the other [[animal people]]. Standing at 47,500 cm<sup>3</sup>, they're approximately 12,500 cm<sup>3</sup> shorter than a [[dwarf]], so they pose more of a threat than the average Lynx, but not much. However, like any of the other animal people, they can join other civilizations and are just as capable of becoming threats in their own right with enough dedication and adventuring.

Being exclusive only to savage Taiga biomes, only three can exist per region before being locally considered [[extinct]]. Unlike their animal brethren, they can't be butchered for parts either, severely limiting their usefulness. Arguably, they're more likely to be an [[Noble|annoying crimp on anybody's day]] than an actual [[HFS|legitimate threat]], should you choose to [[embark]] on a savage taiga.

Some dwarves [[Preferences|like]] lynx men for their ''ear tufts''.

{{D for Dwarf}}
You better not let them enter your fortress if you don't want your nobles to get robbed and your dwarves to get addicted to skooma.
