'''Giant capybaras''' are [[giant animal]] versions of common [[capybara]]s who can be found in [[savage]] [[wetland]]s. They are roughly ten times larger than a standard capybara, about the size of a full-grown [[moose]], or almost nine times heavier than a [[dwarf]]. Giant capybaras attack when attacked and can be very dangerous: they have been known to drag their quarry into the water and drown them.

Giant capybaras are especially dangerous around unarmed dwarves – they can kill a dwarf with a single blow to the head, rip off limbs until they bleed to death, or even damage multiple internal organs until the dwarf dies. Even worse, they have an ability to resist attacks (similar to the [[bronze colossus]]) – their heads are extremely durable (more than those of dwarves), and they can usually manage to break a dwarf's grip on their throat, even when barely conscious. In the [[object testing arena|arena]], giant capybaras are capable of resisting over 50 dwarves in groups of 1-3 without any additional assistance (as in defeating dwarves single-handedly, without being controlled). They do suffer minor injuries (bruises, minor scars) and occasionally lose consciousness, but are extremely good at survival. They may also appear as [[mount]]s during a [[siege]], easily crossing water-filled moats and potentially sneaking into your fortress via [[well]]s or irrigation systems.

As with most [[fun|dangerous]] wild animals, players attempting to train these creatures in a [[fortress]] should use an experienced [[animal trainer]]. While [[dragon]]s are arguably more dangerous, giant capybaras rampaging through a fortress are generally not desirable (along with most other giant creatures). Unlike most other [[amphibious]] creatures, giant capybaras are [[grazer]]s; when tamed, they require a [[pasture]] for food.

Some dwarves [[preference|appreciate]] giant capybaras for their ''graceful swimming'', ''resonant barking'', and ''beyond enormous rodentness''.

==Trivia==
*The name of these creatures in the [[/raw|raws]] is <code>CAPYBARA, GIANT</code> - most other similar creatures would use <code>GIANT_CAPYBARA</code>.
