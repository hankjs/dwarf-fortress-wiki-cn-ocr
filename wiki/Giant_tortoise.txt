'''Giant tortoises''' are [[Creature|animals]] who live in [[tropical]] [[savanna]]s and [[shrubland]]s. They appear in groups of 5-10 in tropical areas, and can live up to 200 years. When fully grown, male giant tortoises are roughly as large as a common [[donkey]], and twice the size of female giant tortoises. All giant tortoises are equally slow, moving at less than a third of the default [[gait|speed]]. 

Tortoises are extremely benign, and will nearly always react to threats by retracting into their shells, rather than fighting.  Because of this, they nearly never frighten worker [[Dwarf|dwarves]], and since they do not move when in their shell, you can freely build a [[cage]] [[trap]] directly underneath a tortoise in their shell. They will remain in their shell if tamed this way, which may pose a problem when it is time to train them in a zone. When retracted into their shells, they are impervious to unarmed attacks (from dwarves who are not Mighty) and also [[wood]]en [[bolt]]s, making them excellent training dummies for the Observer skill and Archery.

Giant tortoises can be [[Animal trainer|trained]] and kept as low-value [[pet]]s, farmed for [[egg]]s, or bred for a [[meat industry]]. With 5-10 eggs in a clutch, they are poor for [[egg production]], but for the meat industry, they are born in larger numbers than most larger creatures. They produce a moderate amount of meat without tying up your [[pasture]]land, and their [[shell]]s can prove valuable for fulfilling [[strange mood]] requests. With their long lifespan, you can keep them around even when [[retire|retiring]] a fortress for decades. Note, however, that giant tortoises require five years to reach full adult size.

Interestingly, only [[male]]s seem to produce nose [[cartilage]] when butchered (which currently has no real use, and there are far better ways to determine gender). The "giant" is part of the creature's real name, with their [[savage]] counterparts being known as [[gigantic tortoise]]s instead.

Some dwarves [[Preferences|like]] giant tortoises for their ''great size''.

Strangely, many humans mistake giant tortoises for [[dog]]s, and will often make sure to [[Engraver|etch]] their observation into the ground.
