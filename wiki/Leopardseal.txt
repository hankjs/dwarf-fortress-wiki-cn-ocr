'''Leopard seals''' are [[amphibious]] [[creature]]s who can be found in [[arctic]] [[ocean]]s. They appear one at a time and do little but either swim or wander around the coast. They are over six times the size of a [[dwarf]] but are shy and benign, preferring to flee from attackers than try and fight them, which makes them easy prey for a [[hunter]]. In the event they do fight back, a leopard seal will defend itself solely with bites. An infant leopard seal is called a ''leopard seal pup''.

Leopard seals can be captured in [[cage]] [[trap]]s and [[Animal trainer|trained]] into fairly valuable [[pet]]s. Because of their size and fairly long lifespan, they can serve as a good source of exotic livestock in a [[meat industry]]. If you try and breed them, note that it takes a leopard seal five years to reach its full size, considerably longer than most [[domestic animal]]s.

Some dwarves [[Preferences|like]] leopard seals for their ''fierce nature''.
