'''Amber''' is a type of [[material]] made from fossilized tree resin. Although it has been present in ''Dwarf Fortress'' since the very first release, amber has never served an in-game purpose, as your dwarves cannot produce it (even though the [[furniture]] and [[finished goods]] [[stockpile]]s include amber within the "Other Materials" listing). Civilizations with {{token|OCEAN_PRODUCTS|e}} (and in proximity to appropriate oceans) have access to this material and can make it into crafts. Thus, very little is known about the material or what its purpose in the game is, though a use might still be implemented in the future. [[Titan]]s, [[forgotten beast]]s, and [[demon]]s are occasionally made of amber, though like all non-fleshy procedurally generated creatures, these only leave ''pieces'' of amber behind when killed.  Amber has the exact same material properties as snow, [[mud]], and [[vomit]] – even punching it a few times will probably be enough to kill creatures made of it. 

Amber is one of the three unimplemented organic materials in the game, the others being [[coral]] and [[pearl]]s. Dwarves can still have [[preference]]s for these materials; more annoyingly, [[noble]]s can still issue [[demand]]s involving these materials.
