'''Cherry''' is one of the many genera of [[tree]]s found above ground. Like the vast majority of aboveground trees, cherry [[wood]] is brown and produces brown products.

They of course produce cherries, which may be eaten raw, cooked, or brewed into [[alcohol|cherry wine]]. In the Summer season, cherry trees are unique in that they produce white clouds of cherry blossoms around themselves as they shed their flowers, which can easily be mistaken for [[mist]], syndrome-causing clouds, or a cave-in. In autumn, the trees drop their fruit en masse.

Logs and leaves can be processed in a [[dyer's shop]] into [[dye]] - logs for pale pink and leaves for light brown.

Some [[Dwarf|dwarves]] [[Preferences|like]] cherry trees for their ''blossoms'' and their ''fruit''.
