'''Firefly men''' are [[animal people]] variants of the common [[firefly]], who can inhabit most [[savage]] [[biome]]s. They spawn in groups of 2-5 individuals and are generally content to keep to themselves, but may pick fights if provoked. In terms of size, they are a little over half the weight of the average [[dwarf]]. All firefly men are born with Legendary [[skill]] in [[Climber|climbing]].

Like other savage animal people, firefly men can join [[civilization]]s, become [[historical figure]]s, appear as [[visitor]]s and be playable in [[adventurer mode]].

Some dwarves [[Preferences|like]] firefly men for their ''enchanting glow''.

{{D for Dwarf}}

Contrary to some misattributed quotes, they do not prefer to be called captain, and as their torsos are weak, they avoid wearing tight pants at all costs.
