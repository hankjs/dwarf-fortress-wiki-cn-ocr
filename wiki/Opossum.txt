'''Opossums''' are small, solitary [[Creature|animals]] found in many [[temperate]] [[biome]]s. Smaller than your average [[cat]], they're benign and do little but meander around cluelessly, being easy prey for any [[dwarf]] who attempts to hunt them. They possess thick fur, which provides them with increased insulation compared to most other animals. A newborn opossum is called a ''baby''.

Opossums can be captured in [[cage]] [[trap]]s and [[Animal trainer|trained]] into exotic [[pet]]s of quite low value. Given their small size, they provide very few returns when [[butcher]]ed, making them poor targets for a [[meat industry]].

Some dwarves [[Preferences|like]] opossums for their ''ability to play dead''.
