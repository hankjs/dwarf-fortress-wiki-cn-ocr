'''Iron''' is an important resource, needed for [[steel]], the best mundane [[metal]] for [[weapon]]s and [[armor]], and if steel availability is limited, iron is next best, though only slightly better than [[bronze]]. Iron is also a [[Fire-safe|fire]] and [[magma-safe]] [[material]] that can be used to make most anything.

Three [[ore]]s contain iron: [[hematite]], [[magnetite]], and [[limonite]].

Iron does not rust in game, so there's no harm in leaving iron objects out in the rain or submerging them in [[water]].

== Uses==
* Melee weapons. Mostly useful for edged weapons; good for bolts as well. You can also make crossbows out of iron, but there are better metals.
* Armor. It's pretty good, though not the best.
* Construction, if you are so inclined.
* Good-quality [[furniture]]. It is quite heavy, however.
* Magma-safe mechanisms, though there are plenty of magma-safe [[stones]] that would work just as well, if you can get your hands on them.
* [[Anvil]]s, which can only be made from iron or [[steel]].

== Production ==
Iron comes from three ores: [[hematite]] (veins in sedimentary, small clusters in all other stone layers), [[magnetite]] (large clusters in sedimentary, small clusters in all other stone layers), and [[limonite]] (veins in sedimentary only).  Any of these iron ores can be smelted at a [[smelter]] to produce four iron bars. If you have a standard smelter, a bar of [[fuel]] will be necessary; magma smelters require no fuel to operate (though steel still needs it as a carbon source).

Iron will also be available through [[goblinite]], as well as the dwarven and human caravans.

== Alloys ==
Iron may be combined with other materials at a [[smelter]], mostly for the production of [[steel]]

* Iron + [[Flux]] + [[Fuel]] = [[Pig iron]]
* Iron + [[Pig iron]] + [[Flux]] + [[Fuel]] = 2 × [[Steel]]

Note that [[fuel]] is used as a reactant: even [[magma smelter]]s need fuel for these reactions. A standard smelter will require two bars of fuel, one as a reactant and one to operate the furnace. This conforms with the process of carbonization of iron and [[pig iron]] in ferrous metallurgy in real life.
