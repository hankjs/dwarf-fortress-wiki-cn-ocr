'''Tiger men''' are [[animal people]] versions of the common [[tiger]], often inhabiting [[savage]] [[forest#Tropical dry broadleaf forests |tropical forests]] and [[wetland|coastal/wetland]] [[biome|areas]]. They are large, predatory carnivores that can present a [[fun|significant threat]] to an unarmed [[dwarf]], as they are over twice the size of the average [[human]].

Like other savage animal people, they can join [[civilization]]s, become [[historical figure]]s, appear as [[visitor]]s and be playable in [[adventurer mode]].

Some dwarves [[preference|prefer]] tiger men for their ''stripes, of course''.

==Tamed tiger men==
In previous versions, [[Elves|elven]] merchants used to sometimes bring tamed (enslaved?) tiger men to [[trade]]. As they could not work, they had plenty of time to improve their social skills and could even become the [[mayor]] of a fortress. This was due to the combination of the Tiger Man's [PET] and [CAN_LEARN] tags; however, since the first one was removed in version 40.05, this no longer happens. 

==Behavior==
<!-- Reference: Tony the Tiger-->
Tiger men prefer to consume [[prepared meal|meals]] made from [[flour]], [[Dwarven sugar]] and [[milk]] when possible. Particularly [[attributes|tough]], [[attributes|agile]] and [[attributes|strong]] tiger men may become [[broker]]s for this food combination, urging [[caravan]]s arriving to your fortress to purchase it while profusely claiming it is ''great''.

<!-- Reference: Hobbes-->
Some tiger men will form close bonds with blonde, mischievous dwarven [[child|children]]. The child will often own a red-colored <s>minecart</s> wagon, and have a fierce grudge with a brunette child of the opposite gender in your fort.

<!-- Reference: Tigger-->
Other tiger men are capable [[building destroyer]]s and tend to wreak havoc if they enter the [[elven]] home of a corresponding [[sloth bear man]]. Inexperienced tiger men readily consume [[honey]] from sloth bear men's stockpiles of [[glaze|glazed]] [[jug|«+earthenware jugs+»]] despite their innate negative [[preference]] for it, leading to a negative [[thought]]. Some dwarves like tiger men for their ''tail-bouncing propagation''.

<!-- Reference: Tiger Woods-->
A distinct lineage of tiger men may achieve legendary [[maceman]] [[skill]], specifically with masterwork [[wood]]en or [[iron]] [[mace]]s, demonstrating an uncanny ability to propel small [[bone]] [[toy]]s across vast [[pasture]]s into designated [[refuse]] pits with exceptional accuracy. These tiger men often develop a strong preference for [[clothing|tunic]]s dyed with [[redroot dye]] during these striking displays. Despite their high [[focus]] skill, these tiger men are notorious for triggering [[berserk]] rages in their [[spouse]]s. Following a failed [[liar]] check, the aforementioned [[iron]] [[mace]] might unexpectedly be wielded by the spouse, prompting the tiger man to make a hasty exit from their [[quality|opulent]] [[throne room]] using a [[steel]] [[minecart]]. Their erratic handling of these minecarts often derails them into iron [[floodgate]]s resulting in water surges, or colliding with [[fungiwood]] [[tree]]s. Separately, fortress [[sheriff]]s have, on occasion, discovered these same tiger men in inappropriate [[status|stunned]] or [[status|unconscious]] statuses while nominally in command of the aforementioned steel minecart. Such incidents invariable lead to swift but light sentences, often a temporary suspension of their [[booze]] rations.

<!-- Reference: Joe Exotic-->
Furthermore, some tiger men develop an almost pathological need for public attention, often attempting to obsessively amass a large collection of other, lesser [[cat|felines]], always in poorly constructed [[cages]] near their [[lair]]s. These tiger men always exhibit a [[preference]] for unusually styled [[lion]] [[leather]] [[clothing|cap]]s and garishly [[dye]]d cave spider silk cloaks, and have been known to frequently [[performer|perform]] surprisingly popular, if discordant, ballads detailing their numerous grievances, often against certain [[leopard man|leopard women]] with a higher [[animal training]] skill level than them. On occasion, such a tiger man might launch a spectacularly ill-advised campaign for [[mayor]], only to find their ambitions severely curtailed by the [[captain of the guard]] following successful interrogations about [[intrigue|murder plots]] (attempted by dispatching poorly-trained [[gorilla|gorilla men]] to cause mayhem) and the suspicious use of low-value [[meat]] [[stockpile]]s.
