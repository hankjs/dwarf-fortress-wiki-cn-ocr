{{creaturedesc}}

'''Sloth bears''' are rare solitary [[creature]]s that [[Thief|raid]] your [[food]] and [[alcohol|drink]] [[stockpile]]s who may be found in [[tropical]] [[forest]]s. They are the smallest species of bear in the game, though they're still nearly twice the weight of a [[dwarf]] and can make quick work of an unarmed civilian. No more than three sloth bears will inhabit a given surrounding before they become [[extinct]]. Unlike other species of bear, sloth bears do appear during the [[Calendar|winter]] season. An infant sloth bear is called a ''cub''.

Sloth bears can be captured in [[cage]] [[trap]]s and [[Animal trainer|trained]] into fairly valuable exotic [[pet]]s. This makes them a fairly decent option for a highly-rewarding breeding program: sloth bear parts are worth twice as much as those of more [[domestic animal]]s. However, unlike [[grizzly bear]]s, sloth bears cannot be trained for hunting or war.

Some dwarves [[Preferences|like]] sloth bears for their ''large floppy ears''.
