{{For/see|the month|[[Calendar]]}}

'''Felsite''' is the name of the third month of the dwarven [[calendar]], covering late Spring. This is the month that the [[elf|elven]] [[caravan]] is most likely to arrive in (although it can also arrive in [[Granite]] or [[Slate]]), as well as, sometimes, the month in which most [[immigration|migrants]] arrive.

Felsite, although it is a fine-grained volcanic rock in real life, does not exist as a [[stone]] type in ''Dwarf Fortress'' since the 2010 version; it has subsequently been replaced with [[Dacite]].
