'''Rutherers''' are massive [[creature]]s who can be found meandering on the second and third layers of the [[caverns]], appearing in groups of 3-7 individuals. An adult rutherer weighs around 3 tonnes, which is about 50 times heavier than a [[dwarf]], though, despite this, they are in fact entirely benign, fleeing from anything they may consider a threat. In the event they engage in battle, they will use their massive size to easily tear dwarves apart with bites and kicks. They are exotic [[mount]]s and may be ridden by [[goblin]]s during [[siege]]s.

Rutherers can be captured in [[cage]] [[trap]]s and [[Animal trainer|trained]] into valuable [[pet]]s. They provide a great quantity of returns when [[butcher]]ed, and products made from their parts are [[Item value|worth]] 3 times more than those of common domestic animals. This makes the idea of a rutherer farm an attractive one, especially since the creatures constantly give birth to more than one baby at a time. However, rutherers only reach their maximum size after 5 years, considerably longer than most sources of food, and they take '''10 years''' to become adults, which means domesticating them and building a significant breeding population can take a very long time.

Unlike most beasts, rutherers can't be spawned in the [[object testing arena]].

Some dwarves [[Preferences|like]] rutherers for their ''enormous tails''.
