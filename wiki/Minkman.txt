'''Mink men''' are [[animal people]] variants of the common [[mink]] who can be found in [[savage]] [[temperate]] [[lake]]s and [[river]]s. They spawn in groups of 1-5 individuals and are generally content to keep to themselves. In terms of size, they are a little over half the weight of the average [[dwarf]].

Like other savage animal people, mink men can join [[civilization]]s, become [[historical figure]]s, appear as [[visitor]]s and be playable in [[adventurer mode]].

Some dwarves [[Preferences|like]] mink men for their ''long bodies''.
