'''Bats''' are a species of [[vermin]] which can be encountered both in [[caverns]] and non-freezing above-ground [[biome]]s. They can be captured by [[trapper]]s and turned into low-value [[pet]]s, though they are one of the species of hateable vermin; some [[dwarves]] absolutely detest bats, and will receive unhappy [[thoughts]] when encountering them. All bats are born with Legendary skill in [[Climber|climbing]].

Some dwarves [[Preferences|like]] bats for their ''haunting cries''.

<!-- Reference: theories regarding the origins of COVID-19 -->
Despite popular belief, bats (alongside [[pangolin]]s) will ''not'' cause a long-lasting outbreak of any type of disease; therefore workshops do not need to be quarantined or outright abandoned. Nor do face masks (aside from [[armor]]) need to be made.
