'''Moths''' are a species of unremarkable [[above ground]] [[vermin]] who may be found in any non-freezing [[biome]]. They may be caught by [[trapper]]s in [[animal trap]]s, but will not stumble into baited ones. They do not appear during the [[winter]].

Technically, moths possess Legendary [[skill]] in [[Climber|climbing]], though only for [[moth man|moth men]] and [[giant moth]]s to inherit - being vermin, moths themselves have no skills at all.

Some dwarves [[Preferences|like]] moths for their ''coloration''.
