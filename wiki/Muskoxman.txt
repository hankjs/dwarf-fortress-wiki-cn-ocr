'''Muskox men''' are [[animal people]] versions of the common [[muskox]], inhabiting [[savage]] [[tundra]]s and [[temperate]] [[grassland]]s. They spawn in groups of 1-5 individuals and are generally content to keep to themselves, but will fight back if provoked. In terms of size, they are almost three times the size of the average [[dwarf]].

Like other savage animal people, they can join [[civilization]]s, become [[historical figure]]s, appear as [[visitor]]s and be playable in [[adventurer mode]].

Some dwarves [[Preferences|like]] muskox men for their ''strength''.
