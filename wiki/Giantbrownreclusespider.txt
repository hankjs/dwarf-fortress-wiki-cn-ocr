'''Giant brown recluse spiders''' are [[giant animal]] versions of the common [[brown recluse spider]] who inhabit [[savage]] [[temperate]] broadleaf [[forest]]s. While their original counterparts are [[vermin]], these [[creature]]s are over three times bigger than a [[dwarf]], and as large as a [[giant cave spider]]. While they aren't particularly aggressive, giant brown recluses will attack if provoked, which can quickly lead to the death of dwarves due to the spider's [[Syndrome|venom]] and immunity to [[No Pain|pain]] and [[No Stun|stunning]]. Their existence in a biome is marked by the presence of their [[web]] on the surface. Unlike giant cave spiders, however, giant brown recluses are unable to spew web as a form of combat, making them considerably easier to kill.

Giant brown recluse spiders can be captured in [[cage]] [[trap]]s and [[Animal trainer|trained]] into [[pet]]s, possessing the standard giant creature pet value. They are born adults and can't be turned fully tame. While [[Silk farming|farming silk]] out of them may come to mind, it's not as good an idea as it sounds; their silk possesses normal [[item value]], they only produce web sporadically and don't shoot it in huge quantities like a giant cave spider does, and they are extremely short-lived creatures, only living from 1 to 2 years max. All of it makes them a very poor choice for silk production, though you can always [[butcher]] them instead. Like other giant beasts, they are are exotic [[mount]]s. 

Some dwarves [[Preferences|like]] giant brown recluse spiders for their ''venomous bite''.
