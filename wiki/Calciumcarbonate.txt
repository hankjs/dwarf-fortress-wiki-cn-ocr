'''Calcium carbonate''' [[stone]] is a subcategory of stone which is useful in the production of [[quicklime]]. The following stones fall under this reaction class:

:* {{Raw Tile|"|7:7:1}} {{Raw Tile|•|7:1}} [[File:calcite_sprite.png|14px]] [[Calcite]] 
:* {{Raw Tile|░|7:7:1}} {{Raw Tile|•|7:1}} [[File:chalk_sprite.png|14px]] [[Chalk]]
:* {{Raw Tile|▓|7:7:1}} {{Raw Tile|•|7:1}} [[File:limestone_sprite.png|14px]] [[Limestone]]
:* {{Raw Tile|▓|7:7:1}} {{Raw Tile|•|7:1}} [[File:marble_sprite.png|14px]] [[Marble]]

==Obtaining calcium carbonate stone==
These stones can be mined out just like any other, but only form under certain conditions: Chalk and limestone form in [[sedimentary layer]]s near the surface, while marble is [[metamorphic layer|metamorphic]], making it a common find in the deeper Z-levels. Calcite only forms in clusters within layers of limestone and marble. Layers of calcium carbonate can often be spotted at [[embark]] by looking for "Flux Layer(s)" in the site description - so long as the flux stone in question is not [[dolomite]], you'll have access to calcium carbonate very close to the surface. [[Dwarf|Dwarven]] [[caravan]]s can bring any of the calcium carbonate stones as trade goods, but will not bring them in very large quantities.

==Uses==
The one unique trait of calcium carbonate stone is that it can be converted to [[quicklime]] powder at a [[kiln]] or [[magma kiln]]. This reaction requires an empty bag, as well as whatever [[fuel]] is necessary to operate the kiln. However, all calcium carbonate stone also qualifies as [[flux]], a crucial element in [[steel]] production. Steel is unarguably the more valuable and practical product to pursue, as quicklime can only be used to produce [[milk of lime]] and [[parchment]], but generally speaking, access to multiple layers of calcium carbonate stone will provide your fort with enough material to operate both industries. Additionally, all calcium carbonate stone has a [[value]] twice that of most stone, making it a good candidate for use in stone [[furniture]] or [[crafts]].
