'''Lions''' are strong, carnivorous and very rare [[Creature|felines]] found in [[tropical]] areas, where they appear in prides of 1 to 3 individuals. At over thrice the size of the average [[dwarf]], wild lions are quite dangerous to unarmed civilians and can rip a dwarf apart in seconds, and as such, they should be engaged with an armored [[squad]] if necessary. A newborn lion is called a ''cub''.

Lions can be captured in [[cage]] [[trap]]s and [[Animal trainer|trained]] into exotic [[pet]]s, and they're also sometimes brought along with [[Elf|elven]] [[caravan]]s. They can receive additional war or hunting training as well, with their large size and maximum [[Gait|speed]] making them particularly attractive for the purpose of [[fortress defense]], however their {{token|MEANDERER}} tag will cause them to move around very slowly, making them unreliable{{Bug|9588}}. Products made from lion parts are [[item value|worth]] thrice more than those made from parts of common animals. They take 3 years to reach adulthood, though are fully grown by the age of 2. Additionally, lions are exotic [[mount]]s and as such may appear during [[siege]]s, being used by surface-dwelling races.

Some dwarves [[Preferences|like]] lions for their ''roars''.
