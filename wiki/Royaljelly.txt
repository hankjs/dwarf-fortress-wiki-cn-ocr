'''Royal jelly''' is a product of the [[beekeeping industry]] collected from an artificial bee [[hive]]. Royal jelly is stored in [[jug]]s, and can only be used as a [[liquid]] ingredient in [[prepared meal]]s. Due to a bug, dwarves may store royal jelly jugs as finished goods; combined with a [[cook]]'s aversion to liquid ingredients, it is very rare to see royal jelly cooked at all. That isn't necessarily a bad thing, though, since royal jelly is only available in single-unit stacks and has the same base value as most other foods. 

The contents of a [[hive]] with a colony of [[honey bee]]s that is toggled to "gather any products" will be harvested as part of the [[beekeeping industry]]. In order to collect the royal jelly, you must have a dwarf with the [[beekeeper|beekeeping]] labor active and empty [[jug]]s. A [[honeycomb]] will also be produced.

Royal jelly and [[honey]] are the edible products of bees. In real life, it is used as a nutritional substance for larvae.

==Bugs==
*Jugs of royal jelly may be stored in bins as finished goods, preventing its use in the food industry.
*Collecting royal jelly may require more than 1 jug in storage to begin.
* Cooks will only cook jelly and other fluids as a last resort, instead preferring to cook solid foods with solid foods. {{Bug|2393}} For more information, see the [[Kitchen#Bugs|kitchen]] page.
