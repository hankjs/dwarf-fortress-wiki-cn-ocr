:''Not to be confused with [[sloth bear]]s.''
{{creaturedesc}}

'''Sloths''' are rare solitary [[Creature|animal]]s found in [[tropical]] [[forest]]s. They are only slighty bigger than your average [[cat]] and are entirely benign, being harmless to [[Dwarf|dwarves]] or just about anything. As expected, they move extremely slowly, moving at the near minimal [[gait]] speed of the game. All sloths are born with Legendary [[skill]] in [[Climber|climbing]].

Sloths can be captured in [[cage]] [[trap]]s and [[Animal trainer|trained]] into exotic [[pet]]s. Their small size translates to a low amount of returns when they're [[butcher]]ed, making them a bad choice for livestock.

Some dwarves [[Preferences|like]] sloths for their ''slow movement''.
