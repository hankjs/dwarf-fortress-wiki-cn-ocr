'''Great horned owls''' are a species of [[Creature|bird]] who may be encountered in almost all [[biome]]s in the game. They appear one at a time and, while carnivorous, are only as large as [[duck]]s and pose no threat to [[dwarves]]. All great horned owls are born with Legendary [[skill]] in [[Climber|climbing]].

Great horned owls may be captured in [[cage]] [[trap]]s and [[Animal trainer|trained]] into cheap exotic [[pet]]s. They give minimal returns when [[butcher]]ed, making them a poor target for [[hunter]]s,  although, somewhat surprisingly, they do provide 1 skin for [[leather]] and enough fat for 2 bars of [[soap]].  Their females lay a meager amount of [[egg]]s if placed in a [[nest box]], overall making them fairly useless creatures in most application.

Some dwarves [[Preferences|like]] great horned owls for their ''ear tufts'' and their ''piercing yellow eyes''.

Even the wisest owl does not know how many licks it takes to get to the center of a [[sweet pod|dwarven sugar]] and [[cacao tree|cacao bean]] [[cook|biscuit]].

Unlike what many supernatural creatures would like you to believe, the owls are exactly what they seem.
