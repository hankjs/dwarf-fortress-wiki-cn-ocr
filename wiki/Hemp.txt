'''Hemp''' is a highly versatile [[aboveground]] [[crop]] that supports the [[food]], [[textile industry|textile]], [[paper industry|paper]] and [[soap]] industries. The plants can be [[plant processing|processed]] at a [[farmer's workshop]] to produce hemp plant fiber [[thread]], and can also be [[millstone|milled]] into [[flour]] or [[slurry]], the latter of which can be [[screw press|pressed]] into [[sheet]]s.

Hemp seeds can be milled into paste at a [[quern]] or [[millstone]], which in turn can be pressed into hempseed [[oil]] and a [[press cake]] at a [[screw press]]. Hemp and [[flax]] are the only millable plants that can be stored in containers made from their own fibers.


Some [[dwarves]] [[Preferences|like]] hemp plants for their ''leaves''.

{{D for Dwarf}}
For some reason, [[human]]s are particularly [[Strange mood|secretive]] about their hemp [[Farm plot|farms]], especially when their [[noble]]s are around. As dwarven [[broker]]s have reported, humans consider [[mill]]ed hemp a highly [[value]]d good, though no dwarf knows why.
