'''Great white sharks''' are massive [[Cartilage|cartilaginous]] [[Creature#Aquatic|fish]] that can be found in [[temperate]] and [[tropical]] [[ocean]]s. At two tons, adult great whites are huge creatures, and as such will provide a great amount of returns if [[butcher]]ed. As fully-sized creatures, they can't be fished by [[Fisherdwarf|fisherdwarves]], but can be caught with a [[drowning chamber]]. An infant great white shark is called a ''great white shark pup''.

Being cartilaginous, great white sharks won't give [[bone]]s if butchered (though they'll still provide a [[skull]]).

Some dwarves [[Preferences|like]] great white sharks for their ''ability to make one afraid to go into the water''.

{{D for Dwarf}}
One of the proper uses of a [[Activity zone#Pit/Pond|pit]] is for dumping captured enemies into a shark-infested pool. Unfortunately, functionality to allow one of your dwarves to sit on a [[throne]] and pet a [[cat]] while doing so has not yet been implemented. (Actually, that might be possible to arrange, since the ability to pet animals was added in [[Release_information/0.47.01|0.47.01]].)
