'''Needs''' affect a creature's focus - needs that are unmet for long enough will increasingly damage the creature's '''focus''', while sufficiently well-satisfied needs will improve it. Better focus leads to better results from work--essentially, a boost to all skills. Distraction is the opposite--an unfocused dwarf may become sloppy in their work, making worse crafts or failing a block during combat.

The need system replaces the generalized [[on break]] feature of previous versions. Dwarves will sometimes perform jobs that satisfy their personal needs, instead of working for the betterment of the fortress. These personal-fulfillment jobs generally come in two varieties: low-priority (indicated by green text, e.g. {{DFtext|Listen to Poetry|2:1}}), or high-priority (magenta text with an exclamation point, e.g. {{DFtext|Pray to Lorsïth!|5:1}}).  Low-priority jobs may be cancelled to undertake a fortress job.  High-priority jobs will not be cancelled for fortress jobs.

== Focus ==
:''Overall, Urist is unfocused by unmet needs.''
Focus affects a dwarf's ability to perform. A dwarf with high focus will work faster and produce better results, while a distracted dwarf will take longer to do everything poorly. Focus is separate and independent of overall mood; a dwarf can be happy even with largely-unmet needs, or unhappy yet focused. However, prolonged insufficiency in meeting needs is a cause for both low focus and bad thoughts. Thus, focus can, with prudence, be used to predict future mood developments.

Focus represents the percentage of the combined totals of met over unmet need values. The ratio of 1:1 (100%) represents a neutral state.

Focus statuses:
{| class = "wikitable sortable"
|-
| {{DFtext|Very focused|2:1}}|| 140% and higher
|-
| {{DFtext|Quite focused|2:0}}|| 120-139%
|-
| {{DFtext|Focused|7:1}}|| 101-119%
|-
| {{DFtext|Untroubled|7:0}}|| 100%
|-
| {{DFtext|Unfocused|6:0}}|| 81-99%
|-
| {{DFtext|Distracted|6:1}}|| 61-80%
|-
| {{DFtext|Badly distracted|4:1}}|| 60% and lower
|}

A highly-focused dwarf can receive an effective skill boost of up to 50%; a badly distracted dwarf can receive an effective skill penalty of up to 50%.{{cite|Dev Log 2015-04-12|http://www.bay12games.com/dwarves/dev_2015.html#2015-04-12}}

== Diversity ==
:''She is unfocused by a lack of trouble-making.''

An individual creature's set of needs and their weights (levels) are affected by [[personality facet]]s. For instance, a dwarf that values romance will be unfocused "after being unable to make romance", while a dwarf that personally values nature will be unfettered "after seeing animals". Unreligious dwarves will have no need to pray or meditate; dubious and casual worshippers will have low or medium level needs to pray; committed believers will have high level need; and dwarves following multiple deities will have a separate prayer need, with separate level for each of their deities. Proposed weights per need level are 1, 2, 5, and 10.

As expected, high-level needs hold a much larger sway in a dwarf's overall focus than low-level needs. For example, "immoderation" controls the need for [[alcohol]]; dwarves, thus, are more likely to have a need for alcohol than humans (but most of the time won't have a very strong one). A small percentage have no need for alcohol at all, though they'll still slow down without it, due to dwarves' alcohol dependence.

Needs are shown in the "Needs" sub-tab of the "Personality" tab of a creature's character sheet, which can be accessed by clicking on the creature or from the creat{{k|u}}re tabs by clicking [[File:Mag glass icon.png]] next to the creature in one of the sub-tabs of the "creatures" tab..

Degree of fulfillment:
{| class = "wikitable"
!Descriptor
!Range
|-
| {{DFtext|Unfettered|2:1}}|| 400 to 300
|-
| {{DFtext|Level-headed|2:0}}|| 299 to 200
|-
| {{DFtext|Untroubled|7:1}}|| 199 to 100
|-
| {{DFtext|Not distracted|7:0}}|| 99 to -999
|-
| {{DFtext|Unfocused|6:0}}|| -1,000 to -9,999
|-
| {{DFtext|Distracted|6:1}}|| -10,000 to -99,999
|-
| {{DFtext|Badly distracted|4:1}}|| -100,000 and below
|}

When a need is satisfied, its value is refreshed to maximum (400), regardless of previous value. There is no minimum to how {{DFtext|Badly distracted|4:1}} a need can get. A deeper negative value won't further reduce total focus, which is based on a ratio of all needs' focus rating.


In the absence of needs rated as "Badly distracted" the focus score is expressed as the ratio of:

 [6     * number of Unfettered scores +
  5 1/3 * number of Level-headed scores +
  4 2/3 * number of Untroubled scores +
  4     * number of Not distracted scores +
  3 1/3 * number of Unfocused scores +
  2 2/3 * number of Distracted scores] / (4 * number of scores total)

where the numerator is rounded down to a whole number.

It is currently unknown how "Badly distracted" needs contribute to focus, pending further science, but it is likely that they contribute 2 points each to the numerator.

Satisfying any need will usually result in a good thought and a mild decrease in stress. (If the dwarf has extremely low CHEER, they may "felt nothing after X").

Creatures with {{token|NOEMOTION|c}} cannot satisfy any need and will inevitably become 'distracted'. In unmodded games, this concerns only [[Intelligent undead]].

==Adventure mode meta-strategy==

Upon creating your adventurer, you may want to avoid having any of the non-fulfillable needs: romance, family, friends. Otherwise, you will suffer never-ending [[focus]] disadvantages. 
Some precaution is necessary in sacrifice/altruism -> helping capability is not available as long as you're quite weak (fighting; companions), and maybe in martial prowess if you're not constantly fighting, and so increasing your stats. To fulfill your booze needs, you'll have to visit human towns' taverns or other dwarven fortresses quite often (and fill your extra water storage containers with ale from the barrels for on the road).
