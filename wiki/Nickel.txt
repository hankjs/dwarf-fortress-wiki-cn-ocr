'''Nickel''' is a low-value but uncommon [[metal]] which can only be smelted from [[garnierite]], which is only found in [[gabbro]]. Nickel can be used to create most metalcrafting and construction objects (but not weapons/armor). 

It has the advantage of being one of the few metals that is [[magma-safe]]. Only one [[alloy]] requires nickel, [[nickel silver]] (which is ''not'' magma-safe).  However, the [[zinc]] also required for nickel silver is often better saved for producing [[brass]], which is more than twice as valuable as nickel silver ([[material value]] 7 vs. 3).

As a magma-safe metal, nickel can also be used to construct minecarts that are intended to be [[Magma#Minecarts|submerged to collect magma]].  As the several other such metals are rare or [[Metal#Weapon_and_armor_quality|weapons-grade]] (or both) and thus generally far more valuable, nickel is often the go-to for such purposes. It is certainly the cheapest minecart metal to buy from [[Caravan]]s if need be.

<!-- Reference: "Red Hot Nickel Ball" internet phenomenon -->
Nickel round cabochons, when [[magma|properly heated]], are an excellent tool for !!SCIENCE!! involving the flammability of [[elf|various substances]].
