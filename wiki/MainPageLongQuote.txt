You can wield them in Adventurer Mode. I'm DRILLING THE SHIT out of SKELETONS AND ZOMBIES."<br />"You can wield anything in adventurer mode."<br />"I CANNOT HEAR YOU OVER THE SOUND OF ME DRILLING HOLES IN ELVES!"|3="The numerous steel bars and fortifications I had installed to prevent river denizens entering my water supply turned out to be completely unnecessary as the snakemen found the entrance to be rather... deeper... than they had expected. Dwarves began complaining about bits of snake in the well soon after."|4=You'd think that complete lockdown is a good solution to a [[siege]], but although a dwarven fortress may appear self-contained and fully functional, your dwarves have nothing to do but get [[mood]]y, lash out at a world which doesn't understand their needs, get [[hammerer|hammered]], throw funeral receptions, conduct grief counseling sessions, and perform the occasional keg stand. 

In short, the [[Invader|attacking army]] can simply wait until your dwarves emo themselves to death. |5=Engraved on the wall is a masterfully designed image of a dwarf engraving a wall.

"Hey, I bet we can put those flaming, bony monstrosities into our still to make wicked firedemon brew"? The last fortress I started under conditions this horrible ended with the last survivor going mad after a skeletal mandrill ate his pet kitten and going on a suicide charge into zombie elefants while naked and on fire. And it wasn't even autumn yet. --Herr Zwiebel, on Fort Headshoots}}<noinclude>[[Category:Humor and stories]]</noinclude>
