'''Capuchins''' are small, [[Thief|thieving]] [[creature]]s that can be found in [[tropical]] [[forest]]s and [[Wetland|mangrove swamps]], spawning in loose groups of 5-10 individuals. They will attempt to steal [[Steals food|food]] and [[Steals items|items]] from your fortress, and if confronted, they may attack [[Dwarf|dwarves]] to defend themselves, but generally stand no chance against a [[hunter]] or even an unarmed [[peasant]] in a 1-on-1 fight. Dwarves react violently to the presence of capuchins, generally leading to your civilians running after the poor things and beating them to death without warning. All capuchins are born with Legendary [[skill]] in [[Climber|climbing]].

Capuchins may be captured in [[cage]] [[trap]]s and [[Animal trainer|trained]] into exotic [[pet]]s. They give a low quantity of returns when [[butcher]]ed, making them poor choices for livestock, but are fairly long-lived animals. Unlike most creatures, capuchins reach adulthood at 3 years of age, though they're fully grown by the age of 2.

Some dwarves [[Preferences|like]] capuchins for their ''social nature'' and their ''intelligence''.

{{D for Dwarf}}
Capuchins are also Legendary [[dancer]]s, having a preference for organs.
