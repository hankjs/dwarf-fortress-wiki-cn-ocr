'''Temperate''' [[Climate|climates]] are those that are neither extremely hot nor extremely cold year-round. Bodies of [[water]] and [[river]]s on the surface will [[freezing|freeze]] during winter, although the exact length of time will vary. When you [[embark]], the water may start out frozen and then thaw during the spring, before refreezing during the next winter. Also, the summer months do not get hot enough to cause surface pools of water to evaporate, unlike the [[Climate|hot]] climate. Due to the balance of this temperature, embarking in an area with this type of climate may be well-suited for newer players.
