[[File:bones_icon_preview.png|right]]'''Bones''' are internal (or less commonly, external) rigid white organs that make up the skeletal structure of most living [[creature]]s. Therefore, they're a common form of [[animal]] remains, as well as a handy [[craft]]ing material.

==Fortress mode==
===Acquiring bones===
[[File:skull_icon_v50.png|right]]Any time you [[butcher]] an animal with a skeleton at a [[butcher's shop]], you will produce bones along with several other products. This applies to full corpses, severed body parts, and even fully [[wear|decomposed]] skeletons. Alternatively, if a severed body part is allowed to fully rot, it may leave behind a stack of usable bones without ever needing to be butchered. Note that many civilizations (like dwarves) consider it [[ethics|unethical]] to butcher certain skeletons {{bug|1180}}.

While unmodded dwarves are unwilling to butcher sapient creatures, severed limbs will rot to bone stacks even without butchering. These bones cannot typically be used for crafting, however the bones of undead invaders are sometimes usable by dwarves. This is presumably a bug. 

Bones are never imported in [[caravan]]s, and must be acquired locally.

===Uses for bone===
[[File:bone_icon.png|right]]The majority of the uses for bone are handled at a [[craftsdwarf's workshop]] using the [[bone carving]] [[labor]]:
*Bone [[craft]]s, for sale to visiting merchants. Although low [[value]], their only input is easy to acquire in vast amounts for most forts.
*Bone [[decoration]]s. Any decoratable item can be decorated with bone, adding to the item's [[value]].
*Bone [[bolt]]s for use in [[crossbow]]s. Each work order will consume one unit of bone to produce a stack of five bolts, as opposed to stacks of 25 from metal or wood. Bone bolts are better than their wooden counterparts, and while not as effective as metal bolts, are [http://www.bay12forums.com/smf/index.php?topic=116151.0 still able to pierce metal armors]. Bone bolts are a renewable resource for [[hunting]] animals, as animals are a source of bone.
*Some [[instruments]] and instrument parts may be made from bone, though this depends entirely on your specific [[world gen]] results.
*Bone [[leggings]], [[greaves]], [[gauntlet]]s, and [[helm]]s. These [[armor]] pieces are far less effective in serious combat than [[metal]] armor, but better than nothing. They can be added to uniforms by specifying the color, e.g. "white greaves." Dwarves treat bone armor as "metal" when equipping their [[military]] [[uniform]]s. When crafting bone armor that requires more than one unit of bone, the crafter may take single bones from multiple bone stacks. The first stack selected determines the material of the resulting armor.

At a [[bowyer's workshop]], using the [[crossbow-making]] labor:
*Bone [[crossbow]]s. These are one of the few weapons available without access to [[wood]] or [[metal]]. Although they are nearly useless when used in melee, they are just as deadly as a metal crossbow when firing bolts and weigh significantly less.

====Bone armor====
To be clear, there is no argument that bone armor is even close to any metal counterpart.  Bone armor is only helpful against small animal attacks, and even moderate animals, such as [[fox]]es or [[Rhesus macaque|macaques]], don't need much luck to hurt a dwarf in even the best bone armor. Against any large animals, or metal weapons, it's hardly better than nothing. The sole advantages are that it's light weight, and it's quick to produce since you don't need a metal industry, just some dead animals. The usually recommended uses for bone armor are 1) for Hunters, who (usually) can choose what they're facing, 2) for early fortresses, as a pre-metal precaution against local (small-medium) animals, 3) as a fashion statement, because dressing in bones is just cool, or 4) as some personal challenge, or personal [[Unfortunate accident|reward]] for some unpopular dwarf. Good luck with any of those.

: (For training military skills, you don't need heavier protection (as sparring no longer causes direct injuries), but heavier-weight armor trains the Armor User skill, so, again, metal is preferable.)

Apart from the manufacture of leggings and greaves, each bone-using job consumes only one bone from a stack. Greaves consume three bones per job, making it ideal to craft greaves from lower-value bones and everything else out of higher-value bones if you plan to export the non-masterwork items. The difference is only about 25% in value, but it adds up after making hundreds of items.

If a fortress does feel the need to resort to some bone armor, then avoid helms and chest pieces if any metal is available; protect the head, protect the torso. A broken limb heals, and even a gimped dwarf can still pull a lever, while a crushed skull or organ loss is usually just fatal, game over for Urist McBoneHelm. Bone [[greaves]] are perhaps the overall best bone armor items to make. Poor quality metal [[gauntlets]] and [[high boot]]s give a positive return for melting while greaves do not. (Metal chain [[leggings]], the alternative to greaves, offer little defense against bash attacks such as maces, and any greaves can be layered over them later.)  Metal greaves are also very heavy, and a slow military rarely catches what it's chasing. Bone greaves can be combined with some metal armor parts to make a relatively light-weight, full-coverage uniform for an early or backup military while saving a few metal bars (at the possible future cost of a few brave dwarves' legs).

====Moods====
Dwarves in [[strange mood]]s will occasionally require bones, sometimes even multiple stacks of them. These dwarves will always take an entire stack independent of the number of bones in it.

As the number of bones per stack has no influence on the value of the resulting [[artifact]], it may be worth ''guiding'' your moody dwarf to use smaller stacks. This may be achieved by creating stacks of single bones '''before''' a strange mood happens and forbidding all other stacks of bones when you get the notice of the dwarf having claimed a workshop. (Note that while it is not directly possible to ''unstack'' bones, it is possible to use bigger stacks to craft goods until only one bone remains.)

Dwarves in strange moods will sometimes use bones to craft objects that cannot normally be made from bone, such as [[bed]]s and [[cage]]s.

===Storing bones===
While bones are counted as "[[body parts]]" in the [[stocks]] menu, they have their own subcategory in the [[stockpile|refuse stockpile]] menu. Be aware that stockpiles with "refuse" enabled automatically degrade some items (clothes and armor) quite quickly; refuse should not be enabled in a multi-purpose stockpile. Refuse stockpiles also cause the degradation of stored body parts (such as bones and shells), though at a much slower pace. Bones stored in a refuse stockpile will decompose even more quickly if subjected to [[vermin]] such as [[rat]]s; consider [[pasture|pasturing]] a [[cat]] over the stockpile to minimize decay.

* Dwarves looking at bones (from non-stray creatures) may, in the short term, have a negative mood impact. In the medium term, this can lead to them better dealing with death. However, in the long term, it can turn to apathy. Best practice is to have your bone depot behind a door to make it less obvious to non-users.

==Adventure mode==
Adventurers will come across bones every time they butcher the corpse of a creature with a skeletal structure, and can use them to create wearable jewelry and sellable trade goods. To do so, equip an item with a sharp edge, stand over a stack of bones on the ground, press {{k|x}}, choose "Create," choose "Carve Bone," choose the item you wish to make, and finally select the bone type you wish to use. You will produce the item instantly, no [[workshop]] required.

So long as you're successfully hunting animals, this will net you a significant amount of wealth to trade, especially once the PC's [[bone carving]] skill rises and they start producing higher-quality items. If you have enough strength to handle a little extra weight, the jewelry is also worthwhile, acting as a very minor form of armor and potentially deflecting enemy attacks. It is not currently possible to produce ''actual'' bone armor in adventure mode, however.

Actually, bones do get transported, but the stupid bodies they're transported in need to be removed first.
