'''Presser''' is the skill associated with the pressing [[labor]]. Pressers make [[oil]], [[honey]] and [[wax|craft material]]s at a [[screw press]].

Pressing needs [[jug|jugs]] ({{token|TOOL_USE|Tool|LIQUID_CONTAINER}}). Other storage items will not work as buckets and barrels are furniture.

Presser [[skill|skill level]] is used to determine the speed at which the labor is completed. The type of container used also adds to the value of the final product.

Pressers produce an ingredient of [[soap]] and process [[honeycomb]]s for a fortress as part of the [[soap|soap industry]] and [[beekeeping industry]] respectively. Graphically, pressers will wear brown and dark purple clothing.
