:''Not to be confused with either [[Militia captain]]s or the [[Captain of the guard]]''

'''Captain''' is a position in the mostly-unrealized, civilization-wide dwarven army, acting as leader of a squad of ten soldiers. A captain is appointed by the [[General]] and commanded by a [[Lieutenant]].
They are not appointed in civilization creation, because their Position_token NUMBER is not fixed, it is AS_NEEDED. This means that they are only then created when they are needed, and those circumstances are very rare.
