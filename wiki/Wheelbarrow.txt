[[File:wheelbarrow_sprite_preview.png|right]]A '''wheelbarrow''' is a [[tool]] used to increase the speed of [[hauling]] heavy items. Wheelbarrows can be made of [[metal]] or [[wood]] at a [[metalsmith's forge]] or [[carpenter's workshop]], and can carry a single item (or a single [[stack]] of items, e.g. [[prepared meals]]). The capacity of a wheelbarrow is equivalent to one fifth of a [[Minecart#Capacity_and_weights|minecart's capacity]].

== Construction ==
Wheelbarrows are constructed of either wood or metal:

* Although classified as "[[Furniture]]" for [[stockpile]]s, metal wheelbarrows (only) are manufactured under the "other objects" category.

== Utility ==
[[File:De re metallica 1556-085.png|thumb|Dwarven wheelbarrows are sturdy and practical.]]
Stone stockpiles have 1 wheelbarrow automatically assigned upon designation, though any stockpile can have wheelbarrows assigned in the stockpile settings menu in the "Storage and tools" submenu ([[File:V50 stockpile barrel button.png]]). Wheelbarrows will be stored in their assigned stockpile when not in use; when used to haul an item to that stockpile, the item and the wheelbarrow will both be dropped onto the same tile.  A stockpile's wheelbarrows are only used to carry items ''to'' that stockpile; they will not be used to carry items away ''from'' it. 
Wheelbarrows assigned to a stockpile do have the stockpile number appended, eg. "feather wood wheelbarrow <#1>".

Dwarves carrying items in wheelbarrows will ignore both the weight of the wheelbarrow's contents and the weight of the wheelbarrow itself, moving always at their top speed. This makes them particularly useful for hauling heavy items like stone, which slow haulers a lot.

Dwarves will haul any items weighing exactly 75Γ or more via wheelbarrow if their destination stockpile has wheelbarrows enabled and available. All stone boulders (with the exception of [[raw adamantine]]) weigh significantly more than 75Γ - these are the most common heavy items most players will find themselves needing to haul during normal gameplay. Any items weighing less than 75Γ will not be hauled via wheelbarrow, even if there are empty wheelbarrows available. Once again, the weight of wheelbarrows is ignored for this condition, meaning that a dwarf will not haul a 50Γ object with a 50Γ wheelbarrow, despite how the combined weight would be greater than the 75Γ threshold.

Wheelbarrows carry less stuff than [[minecart]]s, but do not require a track to be preconstructed, and can go up and down stairs.

Initially bringing a wheelbarrow to its assigned stockpile uses furniture hauling and the wheelbarrow will be carried to the stockpile (not pushed), so here the weight of the wheelbarrow actually matters.

== Forging and Melting ==
* Metal wheelbarrows cost '''two''' [[metal]] bars or '''six''' [[adamantine]] wafers to forge.
* When a metal wheelbarrow is melted down, it will return '''1.8''' metal bars for an efficiency of '''90%''', or '''1.8''' wafers for an efficiency of '''30%'''.

== Bugs == 
* If all of a stockpile's tiles are occupied by wheelbarrows, it will stop requesting new items even though the tiles under the wheelbarrows have no stockpiled item.  Consequently, stockpiles need to have more tiles than wheelbarrows to work correctly.{{bug|8861}}

* Items can occasionally be left inside a wheelbarrow, causing the wheelbarrow to become unusable. This can cause a stockpile to stop collecting stone if all of its wheelbarrows end up in this state{{bug|6074}} You can work around this by marking the contents of the wheelbarrow for dumping.

* Dwarves carry wheelbarrows instead of pushing them when the wheelbarrows themselves are being hauled.{{bug|6008}}

{{D for Dwarf}}
When they push an empty wheelbarrow, any dwarf walking by will jump in and demand a ride. To avoid this, the decision was made long ago that empty wheelbarrows must be carried to avoid elvish-type laziness.
