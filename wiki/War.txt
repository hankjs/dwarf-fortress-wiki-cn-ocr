'''War''' is a state of conflict between two [[civilization]]s. During [[fortress mode]], it's a bottomless pit of [[fun]]. Wars are tracked at the civilization level; each site inherits the conflicts of its parent civilization.

==World generation==
War is common during [[world gen]]; civilizations will attack each other's settlements, occasionally destroying a site or taking it over. This also happens outside of worldgen, due to [[world activities| world activation]].

==Fortress mode==
[[File:dwarf_war.jpg|thumb|270px|right|"Battle at the Gates"<br />''Art by Shabzik'']]
In fortress mode, war will cause [[siege]]s to arrive and bring you [[fun]] and [[Goblinite|presents]].
The hostile nation may attack very occasionally or every year, so be well prepared. Civilizations whom you are at war with may occasionally send a [[diplomat]] to try and end the war; you will have the option to agree to the peace treaty, or dismiss the diplomat and continue the war. Wars may also begin without the player's knowledge or intervention. You can see if you are at war with a civilization on the world screen {{menu icon|Y}}; click the {{DFtext|Civilizations|7:2:1}} button, both the list will show the diplomatic situation, and when examining the agreements (by pointing the mouse pointer at the civilization) the capital will have "terror" and "vengeance" as their export and offering.

During a war, you will not receive [[caravan]]s, [[visitor]]s, or tributes from warring civilizations. A "civil war" with your parent civilization will block standard [[immigration]] as well. Additionally, [[migrant]]s arriving during and after a war are more likely to have experience in general [[military]] skills and a random [[combat skill]]. {{verify}}

Not being at war with an already-hostile civilization, such as goblins, does not mean you ''won't'' get sieges from them. You will always get goblin sieges as long as they are not extinct, but being at war with the goblins does mean that the sieges will begin sooner, and will be bigger.

===At embark===
When [[embark]]ing, one can check to see which races their civilization is at war with. Different civilizations may be at war with different races. Goblins are considered to be in a constant state of minor conflict with everyone else, instead of a real war; an open war with them may still break out, however.

===Causes of war===
The following events will make a civilization unhappy, eventually leading to war, possibly without any announcement:
*The death of a [[diplomat]] while visiting your fortress (regardless of the cause of death).
*Failing to keep to the harvesting limit that the [[elves]] set, if any.
*Seizing [[caravan]] goods.
*Annoying particular traders (such as offering the <s>hippies</s> [[elves]] wood products repeatedly) or slaughtering them.
*Attempting to [[Mission|raid]] another civilization for any reason.
*Refusing to give them a [[legendary artifact]] when petitioned.

===Civil war===
It is possible for two sites belonging to the same civilization to declare war on each other, which due to the way conflicts are tracked, registers as the civilization declaring war on itself.{{bug|10878}} All of that civilization's sites inherit this war, making each site hostile to all others. It is not currently known if your parent civilization can sue for peace, but it is possible to [http://www.bay12forums.com/smf/index.php?topic=173306.0 end a civil war] using [[DFHack]].
Should your civilization be in a civil war, you will experience the following effects:
*Your capital might export and offer "terror" and "vengeance", when examined on the world screen {{menu icon|Y}}
*You will not receive any more [[Immigration| migrants]] past the first two hard coded waves
*You will not receive any [[Trading| trade caravans]] from your civilization
*You will not be able to establish a barony{{verify}}
