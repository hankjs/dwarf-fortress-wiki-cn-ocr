{{release notes}}

50.06 was superseded by [[Release information/50.07|50.07]] on the same day that it was released due to a bug that prevented embarking.

:Arena mode is here which means you can new test out creatures, trees, materials and certain item mods before publishing them! Also notably we've added new sprites to show the growth progression of crops so now you'll be able to see where and what you plant!
