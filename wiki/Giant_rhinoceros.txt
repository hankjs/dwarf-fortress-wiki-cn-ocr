Essentially a [[Giant animal|double-height]] [[rhinoceros]]. Since regular rhinoceroses are already fearsome, needless to say the giant one is a serious foe, being [[list of creatures by adult size|the seventh largest creature in the game]], nearly the size of a fully-grown (thousand-year-old) [[dragon]]. They come in groups of 3-7 individuals, and their children are called ''giant rhinoceros calves''. If these beasts reside in your dwarves' surroundings, the possibility of having giant rhinoceroses [[Creature#Agitation|agitated]] should make you think carefully about the number of trees you cut.

Should you catch one with a [[cage trap]] it can be [[animal trainer|war trained]] to fight for you. Note, however, that they are [[grazer]]s that need immense [[pasture]]s to fill their bellies once they are trained. They can also be butchered for great returns.  Being exotic [[mount]]s, they can sometimes appear in [[elf|elven]] [[siege]]s. This is a sign of great [[fun|!fun!]] to come.

Some dwarves [[Preferences|like]] giant rhinoceroses for their ''horns''.
