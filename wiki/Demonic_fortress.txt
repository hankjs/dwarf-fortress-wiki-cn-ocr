''Main article: [[v0.34:Demonic fortress]]''

In older versions of the game, demonic fortresses made of smooth [[slade]] could be found. These have been officially removed since the release of 0.40.01, but [http://www.bay12forums.com/smf/index.php?topic=174649.msg8053864#msg8053864 may still be added manually using a(n) (experimental) DFhack script].
