The '''Farmer's workshop''' is the [[workshop]] used for any [[job]]s involving processing [[plant]]s or [[animal]] products. It is built from any construction material, and must be built by a [[dwarf]] with the [[Thresher|Plant processing]], [[Milker|Milking]], [[Shearer]], [[Spinner]], or [[Cheese maker|Cheese making]] [[labor]]s enabled.  [[Gelding]] also occurs at a farmer's workshop.  This is not a selectable menu option: instead, any animals that are designated to be gelded will automatically be assigned a gelding job at a farmer's workshop.
