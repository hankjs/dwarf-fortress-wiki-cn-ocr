'''Comedian''' is a [[social skill]] used by dwarves while making friends. Dwarves that are particularly good at this tend to make friends easily and will often rise to [[mayor|mayoral]] positions. 

To train this skill, let dwarves idle and chatter amongst themselves. Dwarves with [[personality facet#HUMOR|no sense of humor]] cannot gain comedic skill. Also, dwarves who are [[personality value#MERRIMENT|disgusted by merrymaking]] can't gain this skill unless they also have an extremely humorous personality.
