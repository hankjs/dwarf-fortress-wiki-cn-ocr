'''Beak dogs''' are a freakish [[Creature|species]] of [[gorilla]]-sized, bird-like pack hunters found in [[surroundings#evil|evil]] [[Wetland|swamplands]]. They appear in groups of three to seven and occupy the same ecological niche that [[Wolf|wolves]] do in more normal [[surroundings]]. In the fortress-embarking flavor screen, you are sometimes warned to strike the earth quickly "ere the wolves get hungry", but in the actual game, wolves are too small to opportunistically attack [[dwarves]], preferring to predate on smaller creatures instead. Beak dogs, by contrast, are not held back by such a deficiency: they are close to four times as large as a wolf (two and a half times the [[size]] of an average dwarf), and the {{token|LARGE_PREDATOR}} [[creature token|token]] in their [[raw file]]s that they share with wolves means that they will snack on any dwarves that appear before them, given the chance. This obviously makes them very dangerous.

Beak dogs can be captured in [[cage]] [[trap]]s and [[Animal trainer|trained]] into [[pet]]s. They are considered [[domestic animal]]s in [[goblin]] [[civilization]]s and as such are always found with them, often being employed as attack animals or [[mount]]s during [[siege]]s. [[Mission|Raiding]] a goblin settlement may lead your dwarves to bring numerous tame beak dogs to your fortress as spoils, which is the easiest way to get a hold on the creatures - they serve well on a [[meat industry]] and can also be used in [[egg production]], being far larger than any conventional egg-laying livestock. Additionally, their parts are [[Item value|worth]] twice as much as boring dog parts.

[[Main:Toady One|Toady One]] has said that they are based on a [http://www.bay12forums.com/smf/index.php?topic=32985.msg485243#msg485243 variety of sources].

Some dwarves [[Preferences|like]] beak dogs for their ''large beaks'', their ''hunched backs'' and their ''chatters and clicks''.
