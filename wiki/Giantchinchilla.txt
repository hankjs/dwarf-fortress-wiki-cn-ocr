'''Giant chinchillas''' are [[giant animal]] variants of the common [[chinchilla]] who inhabit [[savage]] [[mountain]]s, spawning in groups of 3-5 individuals, and fleeing if confronted by hostiles such as [[hunter]]s, despite being about three times the size of the average [[dwarf]].

Giant chinchillas can be captured in [[cage]] [[trap]]s and [[Animal trainer|trained]] into exotic [[pet]]s, possessing the default giant animal value, and producing a decent amount of returns when [[butcher]]ed. Like all giant animals, they are considered exotic [[mount]]s, though their restriction to mountain regions means you are unlikely to ever see one being used as such.

Some dwarves [[Preference|like]] giant chinchillas for their ''fur''.
