'''Sloth men''' are [[animal people]] variants of the common [[sloth]], appearing in [[savage]] [[tropical]] [[forest]]s, in groups of 1-5 individuals. Like other sloth-based creatures, sloth men are quite [[gait|slow]], being about half as fast as a dwarf. They are not particularly dangerous, and generally avoid confrontations.

Like other savage animal people, they can join [[civilization]]s, become [[historical figure]]s, appear as [[visitor]]s and be playable in [[adventurer mode]].

Some dwarves [[Preferences|like]] sloth men for their ''slow movement''.
