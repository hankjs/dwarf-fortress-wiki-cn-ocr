=Template=
A template is a wiki tool that acts kinda like a global "copy-paste" function. If you create a template page you can use it anywhere else on the wiki by simply using the <nowiki>{{ }}</nowiki> code. 

<br><i>For example, if I created the page <br>
<nowiki>http://dwarf.lendemaindeveille.com/index.php/Template:Magma_FAQ</nowiki> <br>
I could insert it into any page by typing <br>
<nowiki>{{Magma FAQ}}</nowiki></i><br>


I took full advantage of this to relate FAQ questions from the same category to each other. For obvious reasons, the code in each template is similiar, and [[FAQ addition#Template Code|below]] I provide the "blank slate" version which you can copy and alter accordingly.

'''Note:''' The only way to create a new template, that I know of, is to type it into the address bar (with the little Template: bit to differentiate from a normal page). It will, of course, come up as "No pages match" and you can edit it from there.


==Notation==
I consider it to be important to have a consistent naming system. All the template pages I created were of the form '''Category_FAQ''' (as opposed to "FAQ_Category"). 

<br><i>For example,<br>
<nowiki>http://dwarf.lendemaindeveille.com/index.php/Magma_FAQ</nowiki><br>
Don't forget the underscore! (It becomes a 'space')</i>


==Template Code==
This is the table I used in the templates, and the invisible comments I included to help anyone who wanted to add new questions to the template at a later date. Copy this entire section into your template page, and replace <u>everything</u> that is shown here in bold (note, some is off to the right).

On that note, I'm sorry about breaking the width on this page, but it has to be done otherwise this code breaks (badly) when you copy-paste it. This code is for the Wood FAQ, but you can easily change the names to reflect your new category.
 <nowiki> <!---To add a new question, COPY the following two lines. ALL OF THEM. Yes I *DO* mean the |- stuff TOO. And PASTE them BETWEEN the ###### comments lower on this page.

LEAVE THE QUESTION MARK OUT, as this wiki engine doesn't cope well with creating %3F pages.

</nowiki>

I want to stress that it is important that you get that category's address correct - that line is a web address that will take users to your template's editing options. <br>It includes Javascript - or whatever it is (I'm no IT expert) - and so it's important you don't screw it up.

=Answers=
Don't forget to put the template in the answer page! Otherwise it renders the entire exercise pointless!


For example, if I was answering a question in the Magma section, I would add 
 <nowiki>{{Magma FAQ}}</nowiki>
at the bottom of my answer.
