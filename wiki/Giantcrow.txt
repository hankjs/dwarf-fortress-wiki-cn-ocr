'''Giant crows''' are [[giant animal|monstrously large]] cousins of the standard [[crow]] who can be found in a wide range of [[savage]] [[biome]]s. They appear in groups of 5-10, where they are very common (due to having a local population of 30-50), and spend the majority of their time flying around a particular area of the map. Unlike some other [[giant kea|aerial pests]], giant crows are uninterested in carrying away your hard-won [[food]] and [[item]]s, making them much less likely to migrate towards your fortress intentionally, though their presence may lead to constant job cancellations from dwarves who see them.

Giant crows are generally non-aggressive, though due to their size and numbers they can prove dangerous to civilians and livestock when roused. A moderately-skilled [[marksdwarf]] should have little difficulty shooting them out of the sky, and the resultant impact with the ground will leave them incapacitated long enough to finish the job.

Slightly larger than your standard [[llama]], giant crows have a respectable pet value and can provide reasonable [[butcher]]ing returns, though there is little to recommend them over many similar animals. They are perhaps best left to roam free for your [[hunter]]s to harvest and your [[military]] [[marksdwarf|marksdwarves]] to practice upon.

Some dwarves [[preference|take a fancy to]] giant crows for their ''intelligence''.
