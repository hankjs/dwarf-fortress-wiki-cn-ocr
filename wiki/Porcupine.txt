'''Porcupines''' are small, solitary [[creature]]s found in a wide variety of [[biome]]s. They are entirely benign and spend their time roaming your surroundings aimlessly, being easy prey for anyone who attempts to confront them. Their bodies are covered in spines which, while not actually harmful to the touch, do provide them with more insulation than most other animals. A newborn porcupine is called a ''pup''.

Porcupines can be captured in [[cage]] [[trap]]s and [[Animal trainer|trained]] into exotic [[pet]]s. Due to their small size, they provide few returns when [[butcher]]ed, less than even [[dog]]s, making them poor targets for a [[meat industry]]. Butchering a porcupine will also create a single unusable spine which serves only to occupy space in your [[refuse]] [[stockpile]].

Some dwarves [[Preferences|like]] porcupines for their ''quills''.

{{D for Dwarf}}
Some porcupines are found with red fur, and a lot of dandruff, they also fear everything, and some of them die horible deaths.  Anyone for skiing?
