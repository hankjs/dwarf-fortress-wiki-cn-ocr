'''Sphalerite''' is the only [[ore]] of [[zinc]], and can also be used as an ingredient in the [[smelter|smelting]] of [[brass]].  In the game, sphalerite is found as veins in [[metamorphic layer]]s. 

== Smelting ==
Sphalerite is needed to make two types of [[metal]] [[bar]]s at a smelter:
* [[Zinc]] bars
* [[Brass]] bars - with [[native copper]], [[malachite]], or [[tetrahedrite]]
:: ''(Brass can also be made with 1 zinc bar + 1 copper bar)''

== Other uses ==
Sphalerite is twice as [[value|valuable]] as common stone, and is [[magma-safe]], but zinc itself is not. As such, it's worth considering enabling sphalerite to be used for [[masonry]] (in the [[Labor#Stone use|Stone use tab]] in the Labor menu {{menu icon|y}}), especially if your fortress lacks other magma-safe materials.

== Trivia ==
Interestingly, dwarves can smelt sphalerite into zinc, while in Real Life the stone itself does not melt, but ''sublimates'' (going from solid to gas without melting).
