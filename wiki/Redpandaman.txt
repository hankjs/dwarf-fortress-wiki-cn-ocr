'''Red panda men''' are [[animal people]] variants of the common [[red panda]], found in [[savage]] [[temperate]] [[forest]]s. They spawn in groups of 5-10 individuals and are generally content in keeping to themselves. Unlike their animal cousins, red panda men aren't restricted to eating just [[bamboo]], though they'll only appear in areas where bamboo grows. In terms of size, they are a little over half the weight of the average [[dwarf]].

Like other savage animal people, red panda men may occasionally join [[civilization]]s, becoming full-fledged citizens who may appear in your fortress as [[visitor]]s or be playable in [[adventurer mode]].

Some dwarves [[Preferences|like]] red panda men for their ''large striped tails''.

Contrary to widespread rumors, there are no known records of a human woman transforming into a red panda woman.

There's a creature in the forest
That you may not know
He's got fur of red and white
And a tail that's like a bow
He walks on two legs like a man
But he's not quite the same
He's a red panda man
And that's his name

Red panda man, red panda man
He's the cutest thing you've ever seen
Red panda man, red panda man
He's a furry forest dream
Red panda man, red panda man
He's a gentle and a loyal friend
Red panda man, red panda man
He'll make you smile till the end

He lives among the bamboo trees
And climbs them with ease
He nibbles on the tender shoots
And listens to the breeze
He likes to keep his distance
From the noisy crowd
He's a red panda man
And he's proud

Red panda man, red panda man
He's the cutest thing you've ever seen
Red panda man, red panda man
He's a furry forest dream
Red panda man, red panda man
He's a gentle and a loyal friend
Red panda man, red panda man
He'll make you smile till the end

But sometimes he gets curious
And wants to see the world
He leaves his home and joins a band
Of dwarves and men unfurled
They welcome him with open arms
And teach him many things
He's a red panda man
And he sings

Red panda man, red panda man
He's the cutest thing you've ever seen
Red panda man, red panda man
He's a furry forest dream
Red panda man, red panda man
He's a gentle and a loyal friend
Red panda man, red panda man
He'll make you smile till the end

Red panda man, red panda man
Red panda man, red panda man
Red panda man, red panda man
Red panda man, red panda man...
