The '''candlenut''' is a [[tree]] only found in [[biome|tropical]] forests. Like the overwhelming majority of overland trees, candlenut [[carpenter|wood]] is brown and produces brown products. Candlenut is the third lightest wood, beaten by [[papaya]]s and [[feather tree]]s.

Candlenut seeds can be harvested by setting up a plant gathering [[zone]], but as the seeds need to be cooked before they are eaten, candlenut trees may be best used as wood.

Some [[Dwarf|dwarves]] [[Preferences|like]] candlenuts for their ''nuts''.
