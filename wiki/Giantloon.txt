{{creaturedesc}}
Just like the loon, but with more meat. Lays a good number of eggs, and can be valuable if you want a loon breeding program or a nice food supply.

Some dwarves [[Preferences|like]] giant loons for their ''coloration'' and their ''haunting call''.
{{d for dwarf}}
Although dwarves know about giant loons, when a dwarf talks about a giant loon, he or she is probably referring to a [[Noble]].
