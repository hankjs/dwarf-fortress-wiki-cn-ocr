'''Fireflies''' are a type of [[above ground]] [[vermin]] found flying around in any area that is not [[biome|freezing]] outside of winter, and may not be caught in built [[animal trap]]s. In [[adventurer mode]] at night, they generate light. All fireflies possess Legendary [[skill]] in [[Climber|climbing]]. Fireflies have a unique graphical setup where there is one sprite for the firefly itself, and another for the light alone.

Some dwarves [[Preferences|like]] fireflies for their ''enchanting glow''.
