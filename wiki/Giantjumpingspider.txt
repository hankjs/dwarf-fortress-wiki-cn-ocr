'''Giant jumping spiders''' do not share the web-spitting ability or poisonous fangs of other spider species. They may be considered the least dangerous kind of giant spider, but they are still more than a match for an untrained, [[weapon]]less dwarf. Like other spiders, they are immune to [[stun]]ning and [[Symptom#Pain|pain]], so your dwarves should focus on killing blows, not disabling attacks.

Like all the other new giant bugs introduced in 0.34.01, giant jumping spiders are ''not'' large predators and will generally leave your dwarves alone. They only live a maximum of 3 years, making them a poor choice for [[animal trainer|training]] and [[zoo|display]].

Dwarves may [[preference|admire]] them for their ''ability to leap'' (or their ''striking appearance''). 

Breeding attempts have been successful, observed to breed rapidly, although despite being spiders they breed much like mammals do, with the females becoming pregnant and then giving birth to generally one or two young. Given the lack of any maintenance requirement such as pastures or nest boxes, they make good meat animals and have the added bonus of being able to effectively defend themselves from attackers. As such, they can be pastured with more defenseless creatures that require pastures for protection.
