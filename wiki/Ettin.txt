'''Ettins''' are a [[Creature|species]] of massive, two-headed [[semi-megabeast]]s. They inhabit [[cave]]s and may attack your fortress once it reaches a certain amount of [[wealth]].

Rampaging ettins will [[Building destroyer|destroy buildings]] and tear through unskilled [[Dwarf|dwarves]] with impunity thanks to their great strength. The most notable characteristic of the ettin, compared to a [[giant]] or [[cyclops]], is the fact they have two heads, meaning more than one decapitation is required to dispose of them. Additionally, ettins are [[No Stun|immune to stunning]] and will usually continue to fight even if they lose one of their heads, though they aren't immune to pain and can be slowed by it. Treat an ettin as if it were a stronger [[cyclops]] and prepare yourself accordingly.

Despite their huge size, ettins can be easily captured in any [[cage]] [[trap]]. Since they are intelligent, dwarves will not attempt to eat or make products out of them, limiting their use to [[live training]] or to serve as decoration for one of your rooms.

Beware of ettins and other [[semi-megabeast]]s who have managed to substantially increase their skills, which, by the way, is something no [[megabeast]] is able to do.

Some dwarves [[Preferences|like]] ettins for their ''arguing heads''.

Ettins also seem to have an affinity for clothing-based weaponry, as was documented by a certain <s>bearded bastard</s> dwarf as he saw an Ettin with a pair of trousers bashing in the heads of a few dwarves. It led to some dwarven blacksmiths and clothesdwarves questioning the head-splattering efficiency of pants in combat and their popularity among beasts.

<!-- Reference: Monty Python and the Holy Grail, The Tale of Sir Robin -->

It is well known that ettins have difficulty reaching any kind of consensus. There are tales of a three-headed ettin that took so long to decide what to do with its prey that the prey merely ''ran away'' without being noticed.
