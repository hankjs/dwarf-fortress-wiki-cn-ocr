'''Almond''' is one of the many [[tree]]s found [[above ground]]. Like the vast majority of above ground trees, almond [[wood]] is brown and produces brown products. Their nuts can be processed in a [[dyer's shop]] into light brown [[dye]].

Some [[Dwarf|dwarves]] [[Preferences|like]] almond trees for their ''nuts''.

{{D for Dwarf}}
Almond trees bear delicious crunchy almonds that can be harvested by setting up a gathering [[zone]] underneath it. Almonds cannot be brewed into [[alcohol]]. Therefore, you're better off <s>exterminating each and every one of these ugly, useless potential [[elf]] retreats</s> cutting the tree or cooking the almonds into +Almond Biscuits+.

Sadly, almonds in ''Dwarf Fortress'' are all of the sweet variety, and of [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amygdalin little use] for giving nobles or elves a [[unfortunate accident|meal to die for]].
