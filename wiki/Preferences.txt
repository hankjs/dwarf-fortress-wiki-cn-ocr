[[File:preferences_v50_preview.png|thumb|300px|right|The (in this case, many) preferences of a human bard.]]'''Preferences''' are [[material]]s, [[creature]]s, objects or concepts described as being liked ''(and sometimes detested)'' by someone.

For any dwarf, and many other individuals in or near your fortress, this can be found upon examining them under Personality/Preferences (see image, right).

== Possible objects of Affection or Revulsion ==
Whether they are among your starting [[embark]]ation dwarves, [[immigrant]]s, [[merchant]]s, [[diplomat]]s, [[visitor]]s, or etc., each dwarf is guaranteed to have at least four '''preferences''': one (and only one) each "stone" ''(see below)'', metal, gem, and alcohol, plus a chance (each separately) for many others. In practice, this means that any individual dwarf's list can be quite short or much longer, depending on luck. 

Any given dwarf's preferences can/will consist of the following:

* Various materials:
** 100% chance for one (and only one) random type of [[stone]], [[ore]], type of [[Ceramic_industry#Categories_of_ceramic_wares|pottery]] material, ''or'' [[glaze]]
** 100% chance for one (and only one) random type of [[metal]]
** 100% chance for one (and only one) random type of [[gem]] 
** 1/5 chance of a random type of [[wood]]
** 1/7 chance of a random type of [[glass]] ''(green, clear, or crystal)''
** 1/3 chance of a random type of [[leather]]
** 1/7 chance of a random type of [[horn]]
** 1/7 chance of a random type of [[pearl]] ''(though this never actually occurs — see article for details)''
** 1/7 chance of a random type of [[ivory]]
** 1/15 chance of a random decorative material ''([[coral]] or [[amber]])''
** 1/7 chance of a random type of [[bone]]
** 1/14 chance of a random type of [[shell]]
** 1/14 chance of a random type of [[silk]]
** 1/14 chance of a random type of [[yarn]]
** 1/7 chance of a random type of plant [[cloth]]
** 1/7 chance of a random type of [[paper]] or [[parchment]]
* 1/2 chance of a random [[color]]
* 1/5 chance of a random [[shape]]

* Various types of items:
** 1/3 chance of either a random [[weapon]] (4/5) or [[ammo]] (1/5) ''(1% exotic)''
** 1/3 chance of a random [[armor piece|piece of armor]] ''(1% exotic)''
** 1/7 chance of a random piece of [[clothing]] ''(including [[backpack]]s or [[quiver]]s) (1% exotic)''
** 1/3 chance of a random type of [[furniture]] ''([[door]]s, [[floodgate]]s, [[bed]]s, [[chair]]s, [[window]]s, [[cage]]s, [[barrel]]s, [[table]]s, [[coffin]]s, [[statue]]s, [[box]]es, [[armor stand]]s, [[weapon rack]]s, [[cabinet]]s, [[bin]]s, [[hatch cover]]s, [[grate]]s, [[quern]]s, [[millstone]]s, [[traction bench]]es, or [[slab]]s)''
** 1/3 chance of a random craft ''([[figurine]]s, [[Finished goods|amulets, scepters, crowns, rings, earrings, bracelets]], or large [[gem]]s)''
** 1/3 chance of a random miscellaneous item ''([[catapult part]]s, [[ballista part]]s, a type of [[siege ammo]] (1% exotic), a [[trap component]] (1% exotic), [[coin]]s, [[anvil]]s, [[totem]]s (20% chance), [[chain]]s, [[flask]]s, [[goblet]]s, [[bucket]]s, [[animal trap]]s, an [[instrument]] (1% exotic), a [[toy]] (1% exotic), [[splint]]s, [[crutch]]es, or a [[tool]] (1% exotic))''

* Various [[creature]]s:
** 1/2 chance of a random [[domestic animal]]
** 1/2 chance of a random non-domestic [[creature]] with a {{token|PREFSTRING}} ''(<u>excluding</u> one's own race, [[wagon]]s, [[werebeast]]s, [[forgotten beast]]s, [[titan]]s, [[angel]]s, [[experiment]]s and unique [[demon]]s)''

* 1/50 chance of a random type of [[tree]]
* 1/10 chance of a random type of [[plant]]
* 1/2 chance of a random [[poetic form]]
* 1/2 chance of a random [[musical form]]
* 1/2 chance of a random [[dance form]]

* Various types of [[food]] to "consume":
** 1/2 chance of a random type of [[meat]]
** 1/3 chance of a random type of [[fish]]
** 1/10 chance of a random type of [[cheese]]
** 1/7 chance of a random type of edible [[plant]]
** 100% chance for one (only) random type of [[alcohol]]
** 1/7 chance of a random cookable plant/creature [[extract]]
** 1/5 chance of a random cookable mill powder
** 1/7 chance of a random cookable plant [[seed]]
** 1/7 chance of a random cookable [[quarry bush|plant growth]]

Also...
* 100% chance of ''absolutely detesting'' a random type of [[hateable]] vermin ''(which isn't already explicitly listed as "liked").''  This will give a dwarf a bad [[thought]] when encountering this vermin, either in the wild or in an [[animal trap]].

==Food/Work/Benefits to productivity==
{{old|v=0.47.05}}
Every dwarf will like at least one type of booze, and may like none to several food ingredients. Dwarves get happy thoughts from eating food and drinking booze they [[Preference|like]]; the meal's value can improve only those thoughts.  There are 76 types of booze and hundreds, if not thousands, of types of food preferences. The difficulty in obtaining all types of booze or food means that it is practically impossible to satisfy the [[need]] to eat a good meal. {{bug|10262}} Note that it is possible to obtain all types of booze, especially if modding is used.

A dwarf's preferences (and disliked vermin) tend to feature in any artwork the dwarf makes, more often than subjects not listed in their profile. For example, a mason that likes [[cow]]s for their haunting moos and absolutely detests [[bat]]s, will make statues of both, presumably out of love for cows and horrified fascination for bats.

A dwarf working with a material they like - or creating items they like out of that material - will produce higher-[[quality]] goods. For example, a [[mechanic]] that likes olivine generally makes better [[olivine]] than [[granite]] mechanisms. This is most important during [[embark]], when individual personality profiles and skills can be best matched up according to your specifications. For example, make the dwarf that likes [[bed]]s your [[carpenter]] and the dwarf that likes gold your [[blacksmith]]. [[armorsmith|Urist McLikesbreastplates]] would be a good candidate for Armorsmith.  This works less well later on with immigrants, as it is usually more advantageous to train up the great armorsmith than the novice armorsmith who likes steel.

The game is perfectly happy with giving a creature a bad thought from not eating a favored food, even when said creature doesn't actually like anything.

==Value Considerations==
Some types of preferences have an effect on how creatures perceive the [[Zone#Quality_and_value|value of a room]] and its [[furniture]]:
* Preferences for stone or gem types will increase the value of floors and walls which have been [[smoothed]] and/or [[engraving|engraved]]
* Preferences for materials or item types will increase the value of furniture
* Furniture which has been [[decorate]]d will receive further boosts from each decoration added
* Furniture which was constructed by a creature of a different race will be more valuable to creatures who like that race
* Furniture made from [[dye]]d cloth (e.g. [[bag]]s) will be more valuable to creatures who like that dye's [[color]]
* Furniture decorated with images of [[shape]]s will be more valuable to creatures who like that shape

For furniture, each preference match ''multiplies'' the entire item value - for example, if a dwarf likes the item's type (+1), the materials on two of its decorations (+2), and a shape inscribed on it (+1), the item's value to that dwarf will be multiplied by '''5'''.

==Nobles==

Nobles only give [[mandate]]s and [[demand]]s that accord with their preferences. For this reason, a good way to ameliorate the annoying effects of nobles is to nominate a [[baron]] who has no preferences for anything craftable. This baron won't issue any mandates or demands!
