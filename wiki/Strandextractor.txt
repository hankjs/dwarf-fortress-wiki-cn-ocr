'''Strand extractor''' is the labor associated with processing [[raw adamantine]] into strands. It takes place in a [[craftsdwarf's workshop]]. Processing raw adamantine is very time-consuming for a dwarf with a low extraction [[skill]], and so it is worth only allowing the labor on one dwarf to train the skill faster. As with [[furnace operator]], a higher skill only produces strands faster, as they do not have a quality modifier.
