'''Ash glaze''' is a type of [[glaze]] that can be applied to [[Jug|jugs]], [[Statue|statues]], [[Large_pot|large pots]], and [[Finished_goods|crafts]] made of [[Stone|stone]] or [[ceramic]]s. It is applied to these items by a [[glazer]] at a [[kiln]] or [[magma kiln]] by using 1% of a bar of [[ash]]. [[Earthenware]] [[jug]]s and [[pot]]s can be glazed to allow them to hold [[Liquid|liquids]]. Ash glaze has [[Item_value#Material_multipliers|material value]] of 5.

Unlike [[tin glaze]], the association between ash glaze and its source material is hardcoded into the game itself.
