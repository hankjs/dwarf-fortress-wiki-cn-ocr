'''Metal Crafter''' is a skill associated with the '''metalcrafting''' [[labor]]. Metalcrafters make [[metal]] craft goods, goblets, [[flask]]s, [[chain]]s, [[toy]]s, [[instrument]]s, [[hive]]s, [[pot]]s, [[jug]]s, [[nest box]]es, [[minecart]]s and [[coin|coins]] <!-- and maybe splints, crutches, buckets, barrels? --> at a [[metalsmith's forge]]. The skill is also used to [[stud]] objects with metal. As well, metalcrafting is necessary to make [[construction]]s out of metal [[block]]s.

Most metalcrafting jobs use 1 bar of metal; the only exceptions are wheelbarrows and minecarts, which use 2 bars.  Making crafts produces 1 to 3 crafts (of random types), depending on the skill of the metalcrafter.  Making flasks or goblets always produces 3 items.  Making coins produces a single stack of 500 coins.  All other jobs produce a single item.

Because there are some metals, like [[iron]], [[silver]] or [[gold]], which have a high value and occur in large deposits, metalcrafting is a good way to create high-value [[trade]] goods quickly. Having a skilled metalcrafter stud pieces of [[furniture]] with multiple [[decoration]]s is also a good way to create furniture with very high value for outfitting the [[zone|room]]s of [[nobles]]. Also see [[gem setting]] for another good way to improve furniture.

Metalcrafters also make [[instrument]]s and instrument parts.  Unlike other jobs at the forge, metalcrafters make instruments using the closest bar of metal available.
