==Usage==

[[Historical figure|Legendary beings]], such as a [[night troll]] or [[nightmare]], associated with the [[Sphere|spheres]] of blight, death, disease, murder, nightmares, or suicide will have words from this symbol in their name.

Alongside [[Language SYM.txt/Evil|EVIL]], [[Language SYM.txt/Negative|NEGATIVE]], and [[Language SYM.txt/Ugly|UGLY]], DEATH is one of the possible [[Entity token#SUBSELECT_SYMBOL|subsymbols]] available to [[Surroundings#Evil|evil biomes]].

The [[slab]] of a [[necromancer]] is always created by a [[Deity|god]] of death, and as a divine object will reflect the spheres of its creator when being named. Depending on the god's portfolio, other symbols may be added to the list of potential words when naming the item.
