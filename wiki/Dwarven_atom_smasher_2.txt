The '''Dwarven Atom Smasher''' is a nickname for a [[Bridge|drawbridge]] in [[Garbage disposal|waste disposal]] or militarily-significant applications. It [[exploit]]s the implementation of drawbridges to utterly destroy any objects and most creatures in its target area. A <abbr title="Dwarven atom smasher">DAS</abbr> works fine as a trash compactor to smash [[stone]], [[item]]s, [[water|fluid]]s and [[goblin]]s straight into oblivion.

== Effects ==
Atom-smashing an item will delete it from the game entirely, even [[artifact]]s{{cite forum|169696/8395484}}, though some "soft" references might remain (mainly for artifacts, owned items and corpse pieces). Atom-smashing a unit, on the other hand, just kills it (if it isn't [[Dwarven_atom_smasher#Immune_creatures|too big]]). Dead units may remain forever in the list of dead units, and if the list gets filled with thousands of historical figures, this may limit migration, though unimportant dead units can eventually be periodically culled (see [[Settings#Population_and_seed_capacities|game settings]]). There is also a [[DFHack]] script <code>[https://docs.dfhack.org/en/stable/docs/tools/fix/dead-units.html fix/dead-units]</code> that culls units.

== Smashing against the ground ==
In this design, a drawbridge is built to come down on at least one tile of solid ground. The drawbridge is raised, the targets are placed (or move of their own volition) into position on that ground, and then the drawbridge is lowered, squashing the targets flat and erasing them from existence. Most commonly, a garbage dump [[activity zone]] is used in order to place items beneath the drawbridge (as stockpiles cannot be placed on top of existing buildings), but other methods such as flowing [[water]] have been used with varying degrees of success.

[[Sand]] or [[dye]] in [[bag]]s don't get erased while the bag does, creating a small pile of sand or dye on the ground. Similarly, [[contaminant]]s (e.g. [[blood]], [[vomit]]) are not erased when a bridge descends on them.

It is a good idea to make the tile(s) a restricted-[[traffic]] area, to discourage your dwarves from casually sauntering into the kill zone.

== Smashing upon raising ==
In this design, a very compact drawbridge (as little as one tile long) is used, and the target area is the one-tile wide anchoring area. This often uses walls, locked doors, or other solid objects, leaving the targets nowhere to go. The drawbridge is lowered, the targets are placed (or move of their own volition) into position on the tile(s) that the drawbridge will occupy when raising, and then the drawbridge is raised, squashing the targets flat.

== Immune creatures ==
A DAS will not work on exceptionally large creatures. Creatures with a size over 1,200,000 (e.g. an [[elephant]], [[bronze colossus]], etc.) will prevent a drawbridge from raising if they are standing on it, and cause a drawbridge to immediately deconstruct if it is lowered upon the creature.  See the [[List of creatures by adult size#bridge|list of creatures by adult size]] for a complete listing of creatures immune to bridges.
