'''Giant wombats''' are [[giant animal]] variants of the [[wombat]], found in [[savage]] [[mountain]]s, [[temperate]] [[forest]]s and temperate [[shrubland]]s. Like the regular wombat, these animals appear in small groups of up to ten individuals. Being benign creatures they will meander and generally keep to themselves. Giant wombats are roughly the size of an [[alligator]], or roughly 12.5 times larger than a [[dwarf]], and as such they are a force to be reckoned with against a poorly equipped militia if provoked. Children of giant wombats are called ''giant wombat joeys'.

Some dwarves [[Preference|like]] giant wombats for their ''waddle''.

While it may be fun to build brown [[Block|blocks]] with [[Dwarf Fortress]], be wary of any brown blocks in the vicinity of a giant wombat, as they may instead be blocks of [[filth]].
