{{creaturedesc}}

A fairly boring upscaled [[vermin]] creature that mostly makes a good target for your [[ambusher|hunters]]. Like the [[cat]], it is a legendary [[climber]]. Although it has the word "flying" in its name, it (just like real life flying squirrels) can't actually fly, nor even glide from tree to tree as these animals do in real life.
