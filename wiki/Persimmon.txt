'''Persimmon''' is one of the many genera of [[tree]]s found above ground. Like the vast majority of above ground trees, persimmon [[wood]] is brown and produces brown products.

It may be worthwhile to preserve a population of persimmon trees, as they yield impossibly delicious persimmon [[fruit]]. These fruits can be brewed into delightful [[booze]], cooked in a [[kitchen]] or eaten raw. Also they can be processed in a [[dyer's shop]] into slate gray [[dye]].

Some [[Dwarf|dwarves]] [[Preferences|like]] persimmon trees for their ''fruit''.
