'''Wells''' are [[building]]s that provide access to a [[water]] source for your dwarves. A well can be an important feature of a fortress, providing a clean and usually safe water supply compared to [[river]]s, [[pool]]s and cavern lakes. However, getting water from a well will neither clean nor desalinate it, so you still should make sure that the well has access to clean water.

Wells provide an emergency drinking source in case the [[alcohol]] runs out (don't let ''that'' happen!). A well is a water source that (if constructed correctly) will not freeze in the coldest weather, and should last in hot. Enemies that can swim can and will path into your fort through a well. [[Grate]]s can block underwater threats, but be warned: they cannot stop [[building destroyer]]s which approach from below.

A well constructed above-ground, even indoors, will not prevent the water tile beneath it from freezing. When this happens, the "empty space" requirement for the well is no longer met as the space is occupied by the ice, and the well will be dismantled into its original components (Prevent this by placing it one Z-level above the water source if it freezes).  Furthermore, if the well is built in a layer with a [[temperature]] below the freezing point – that is, an ice layer in a glacier – the water will freeze ''within'' the well bucket, and the well itself will become unusable, showing a "bucket full" message.  To prevent this, build the well and the hospital in the earth layers below the ice.  Dump the ice inside the bucket to recover it.

Using the well 10 times will take a small amount of water from the water tile below ([[water depth|1/7]] from that one tile), so it will eventually dry up, if not replenished.

Using a well provides the user with a happy [[thought]], especially if you make the well with high-value [[chain]]/[[rope]], [[bucket]], [[block]] and [[mechanism]], and/or the builder produces a high-quality result. Drinking [[Water#Stagnant_water|stagnant water]] from a well will still lead to a bad thought, and will lead to [[Health care#Infection|infection]] if used to clean a [[wound]]. If the floor of your water source is covered by a pile of [[mud]] (like the floors of underground pools in [[cavern]]s) then the water drawn out will be "water laced with mud" unless there are two [[z-level]]s of water in it. Badly [[wound]]ed dwarves will drink only water while recuperating, never booze, so you better have a well or water zone ready for when anyone gets injured, and certainly before the first goblins show up. Ensure you have enough buckets as well, as injured dwarves will not go to the well themselves even if it is next to their hospital bed, but require someone to bring them water in a bucket. If a well is full enough and the water is only one z-level down, the tile can also be used for fishing. When you fish "from a well", you aren't actually fishing from the well itself – you're just fishing from the tile of water beneath it, which means that the well needs to be filled all the way to the top.  Dwarves will also use the well to wash themselves - this means that a well (and [[soap]]) are vital for removing [[contaminant]]s such as blood, [[syndrome|poison]], etc. from your dwarves. 

==Building a well==
When constructing a well, it is important to consider placement, safety, the source of the water, and any water [[pressure]] to avoid flooding your fortress by accident. For a wider discussion of adding a well to your fortress, see the (recommended) [[well guide]].

Wells must have a clear vertical pathway straight down to their water source. That source can be an artificial channel, an [[aquifer]], a [[river]], a [[lake]], or an artificial [[reservoir]], so long as it has water in it that's at least [[water depth|3/7 deep]].  [[Brook]]s can be used, but you must first [[channel]] off the [[floor|surface]] of the brook to allow the bucket to dip into the water.  The water can be any distance directly below the well, but it will take a while for the bucket to go down and back up on long distances.  If there is 7/7 deep water somewhere directly below the well, then the depth of the top tile of this water does not matter. [[Image:Well illustration.png|right|thumb|154px|Wells must be built over the water, though they can be many levels higher than the water.]]

The more common well will be created underground and draw water from a source even lower, but above-ground sources can also be used; you just have to build constructions first (typically up-stairs, walls and floors) that provide support at least one z-level ''above'' the water's level where you can then place the well.


To build a well you will need the following components:
:* 1 [[block]]
:* 1 [[bucket]] 
:* 1 [[chain]] or 1 [[rope]]
:* 1 [[mechanism]] 
:* an "open space" or "downward slope" tile (usually channeled by you) to place the well on  

To place a well, press the {{Menu icon|b|m|L}} keys.  That will take you through the various components, and you can choose specifically from among the parts you have available in each category. A well needs to be placed over an open space with adjacent floor tiles; there does not need to be water underneath a well for it to be built, only for it to be active.

A [[mason]]/[[carpenter]]/[[metalsmith]] is needed for construction.  High-value materials can be multiplied by a high-quality effort in construction, resulting in an extremely valuable piece of architecture for your fortress. The dwarves will describe a very nice well as "truly sublime". 

High-[[Item value|value]] mechanisms can be created at a [[forge]] from weapon-grade metals, the most valuable being [[steel]] (material value 30), [[iron]] (10) and [[silver]] (10). Alternatively, you can make rock mechanisms with some [[native gold|gold]] (value 30) or [[native platinum|platinum nuggets]] (40) using the {{k|d}}etail function at a mechanic's workshop.

If a well is working properly, meaning it has direct access to water, it will display "active" when clicked on. If there is something obstructing the well, or there is not enough water, it will display "dry".

While in use by a dwarf, you can see the well's rope and bucket travel across z-levels. Although interesting, if your water source is very deep, it may take a while for a single dwarf to obtain water. This becomes especially annoying if you do not have a steady booze supply, as thirsty dwarves will swarm the well awaiting their turn.

It is possible to build wells directly above one another, and they will still function if there is water below. They will not obstruct one another, as they are not impassable structures. [[Hatch]]es, floor [[bars]] and floor [[grate]]s will block well functionality, if they are between it and the water, but grates and bars will not stop water from flooding out. Grates, bars and hatches will allow functionality again if opened with a [[lever]]. It is perfectly reasonable to have multiple well openings drawing from a single water source, as a well only cares about the tile in a straight line below it. '''Wells cannot function through a stairwell'''. It is possible to have obstacles beneath a well, with the well continuing to function, if the surface of the water is above the obstacles.

A well is essentially a hole in the floor, so dwarves can fall through it under the right circumstances. Using a well is safe, while fighting or flooding near a well may not be. Any dwarves who fall through may escape drowning if the water source includes an escape route.

==Removal==
When removing a well, the components will generally be scattered around the channeled tile, not fall down into the well. One exception is when the bucket is stuck somewhere on the way down which probably happens when a water hauling job is interrupted by a hostile creature. In this case the bucket will drop down into the water source, but the rope, block and mechanism are saved.

In an area where ice forms, a well placed directly over water that freezes will be automatically deconstructed to its original parts. When the ice melts, the parts may be lost. One solution is to leave at least one tile of empty space between your well and any outdoor water sources.
