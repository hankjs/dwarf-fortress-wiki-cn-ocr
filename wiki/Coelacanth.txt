'''Coelacanths''' are a species of [[Creature|fish]] who can be found in [[tropical]] [[ocean]]s. Slightly heavier than a [[dwarf]], they provide a fair amount of returns when [[butcher]]ed. As non-[[vermin]] fish, coelacanths can't be fished by [[Fisherdwarf|fisherdwarves]], but can be caught with the use of a [[drowning chamber]]. While described as elusive and being a rare species in real life, in-game they are as likely to be seen as any other species of tropical fish. Infant coelacanths are called ''coelacanth fry''.

Some dwarves [[Preferences|like]] coelacanths for their ''coloration''.

Despite common belief, coelacanths can be caught regardless if it is raining or not. A coelacanth is usually worth around 15000☼ when sold to a [[raccoon man]].
