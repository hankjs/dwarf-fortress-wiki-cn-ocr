The '''Smelter''' is used to smelt [[ore]]s and [[Melt item|melt]] existing metal objects into metal [[bar]]s. The smelter is also where [[lignite]] and [[bituminous coal]] are processed into [[coke]]. A dwarf must have the "Furnace Operator" labor enabled to use the smelter, and all smelter tasks require a bar of [[fuel]].

If all options in a smelter are red, there are three possible scenarios to explain why:
# No fuel - find/buy [[coke]] or turn wood into [[charcoal]] at a [[wood furnace]].
# The workshop is being specified as a "Give" destination from a stockpile ([[File:V50_stockpile_shopadd_button.png]]) that does not possess all of the necessary materials (including fuel).
# The smelter is located inside a [[burrow]], one of the necessary materials (including fuel) is not available in the burrow, and that burrow has the "Limit workshops to burrow" option enabled ([[File:Ui burrow source inside only.jpg]]).
