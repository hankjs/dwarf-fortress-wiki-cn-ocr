'''Coordination''' is a placeholder skill with no known use. It exists in the game code but does not seem to be implemented, making it not possible for a dwarf to gain experience in it. Presumably, it would positively influence the accuracy of combat actions, having the most influence on quick attacks, since there is little time to aim for these attacks.
