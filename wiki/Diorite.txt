'''Diorite''' is an [[igneous intrusive layer|igneous intrusive]], non-[[magma-safe]] [[stone]] which can form whole [[stone layers|layers]].

Because diorite does not contain a wide variety of large cluster and [[vein]]s, it is an interesting layer for players who insist on color uniformity. Digging and carving inside a diorite layer will produce a uniformly dark gray area, with occasional [[native gold|gold]] veins and small [[gem]] clusters.
