''For information on the selection and training of war animals, see [[animal trainer]].''

Animals with the {{token|TRAINABLE|c}} or {{token|TRAINABLE_WAR|c}} [[creature token]] can be trained for use in war by an [[animal trainer]]. Trained war animals are capable of causing greater damage in [[combat]]{{verify}} and can be assigned to follow specific dwarves.

Trained animals become a permanent "trained war" [[profession]] that has a higher aggression level than the base animal. Training an animal does not present any visible changes to physical attributes (strength, agility, toughness, etc...) in [[Utilities#Dwarf Therapist | Dwarf Therapist]]. Training intelligent creatures for war (that have been modded to be war-trainable) does not inhibit them from performing labors like an actual military profession does. However, it prevents [[squad]] orders from being adequately carried out by the modded intelligent creatures that are trained for war, because it prevents the creatures from changing to the military profession. Assigned war animals will attempt to follow their owner out of the fortress, if the owner was sent on a [[mission]], so it is recommended to unassign them from any [[pasture]]s you have, to make sure they properly path out of your fortress.
