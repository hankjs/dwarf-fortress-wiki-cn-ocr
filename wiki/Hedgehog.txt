'''Hedgehogs''' are a type of [[above ground]] [[vermin]] found in any grassy [[temperate]] area, but not in winter. They can be captured by [[trapper]]s and turned into [[pet]]s. Despite the fact that they are members of [[wikipedia:Eulipotyphla|Eulipotyphla]], they have teeth like a rodent.

Some dwarves [[Preferences|like]] hedgehogs for their ''many spines''.

{{D for Dwarf}}
There are tales of a hedgehog with blue fur and a [speed:0] tag running around, but no proof has been found so far. However, the rumors of some sort of "Hedgehog's dilemma" resulting in dwarves becoming melancholy have been proven false.
