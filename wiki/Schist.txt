'''Schist''' is a [[metamorphic layer|metamorphic]] [[stone]]. It contains a wide variety of [[gem]]s.


==In real life==
Schist is a large class of metamorphic rock defined by its texture or 'schistosity'; the rock is [[Wikipedia:Foliation (geology)|foliated]] in such a way that it can split into small flakes. It is often host to metamorphic gemstones such as [[garnet]], [[emerald]], and [[ruby]].

'Schistosity' is a dwarven term for the mineral-like attractiveness of another dwarf. Example, "Urist rolled a high schistosity score on his stone [[die]]."

Schist is not to be confused with [[filth]], nor can you make [[Block|bricks]] out of it; as the product of a [[stonecutter]] is properly called a [[block]].
