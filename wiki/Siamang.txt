'''Siamangs''' are a very rare species of [[Creature|gibbon]] found exclusively in [[tropical]] moist broadleaf [[forest]]s, where they appear in groups of 5-10 individuals. Twice as heavy as the average [[cat]], these apes are little more than a distraction for a passing [[dwarf]], being benign and overall harmless. All siamangs are born with Legendary [[skill]] in [[Climber|climbing]].

Siamangs can be captured in [[cage]] [[trap]]s and [[Animal trainer|trained]] into valuable exotic [[pet]]s. Due to their rarity and small size, they make poor targets for a [[meat industry]]. Siamangs take 8 years to reach adulthood, but reach their maximum size by the age of 2. Out of the species of gibbon in the game, they hold the distinction of being the only one that is innately able to [[swim]].

Some dwarves [[Preferences|like]] siamangs for their ''loud calls'' and their ''ability to swing through the trees''.
