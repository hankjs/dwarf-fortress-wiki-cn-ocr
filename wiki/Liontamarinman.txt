'''Lion tamarin men''' are humanoid versions of the common [[lion tamarin]] and a [[Creature|species]] of unremarkable [[animal people]], found in [[savage]] [[tropical]] moist broadleaf [[forest]]s. They are a little over half the size of [[dwarf|dwarves]] when adults and spawn in groups of 1-5 individuals. They should pose no threat unless provoked. All lion tamarin men are born with Legendary [[skill]] in [[Climber|climbing]].

Like other savage animal people, lion tamarin men may occasionally join [[civilization]]s, becoming full-fledged citizens who may appear in your fortress as [[visitor]]s or be playable in [[adventurer mode]].

Some dwarves [[Preferences|like]] lion tamarin men for their ''small size'' and their ''manes''.
