'''Worm men''' are [[animal people]] versions of the common [[worm]], who can be found in [[savage]] [[tropical]], [[temperate]] and [[taiga]] regions. They spawn in groups of 1-5 individuals and are generally content to keep to themselves. In terms of size, they are a little over half the weight of the average [[dwarf]].

Like other savage animal people, they can join [[civilization]]s, become [[historical figure]]s, appear as [[visitor]]s and be playable in [[adventurer mode]].

Some dwarves [[Preferences|like]] worm men for their ''wriggling''.

<!-- Reference: "Worms" video game series -->
An archaeological expedition brought to the scholarly dwarven community a theory; that the worm men inhabiting the world are in fact an evolutionary subspecies. According to historical data, the original classification Lumbricina Militus went extinct after they started an Armageddon event claiming the majority of their own in a global civil war. If the historical accounts are to be believed, accomplished worm men could exploit the wind to further amplify the kinetic damage of their projectiles and could weaponize cattle as explosive ordinance. This is a developing field of study, and all dwarven scholars are analyzing the viability in substituting these bovine munitions for [[Stupid dwarf trick|elven alternatives]].

<!-- Reference: "Earthworm Jim", protagonist of titular video game series -->
The spirit of duty in a worm man is not to be besmirched, however. It has been confirmed at least one worm man could harness the use of an elastic pastry to heroically save a litter of [[Dog|puppies]] from a malevolent [[crow man]].

<!-- Reference: "Doctor Worm", song by the band "They Might Be Giants" -->
Be wary of worm men claiming to be doctors, as such claims are highly likely to be false. Worm men have shown a strange propensity for [[Percussionist|drum-playing]] and often adopt false titles as 'stage names,' though they tend to be accepting of critique and are generally curious creatures, provided that you show an interest in their music.
