'''Fish cleaner''' is the skill associated with the fish cleaning [[labor]]. Fish cleaners process [[raw fish]] at the [[fishery]].

Fish cleaner [[skill|skill level]] is used to determine the speed at which the labor is completed.  Fish cleaners can produce food and [[shell|craft material]] for a fortress as part of the [[fishing industry]]. Graphically, they wear dark blue clothes with green underclothing, gloves and shoes.

It is commonly advised to assign [[fishing]] and [[fish cleaning]] tasks to different dwarves: when one dwarf is fishing, another one is busy preparing the fish. One or two fish cleaners are sufficient for a fortress located near a [[brook]].
