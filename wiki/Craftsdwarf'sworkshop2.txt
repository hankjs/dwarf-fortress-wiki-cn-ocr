The '''Craftsdwarf's workshop''' is used to make [[craft]]s of many different kinds and perform a few specialized jobs. It can be built from any construction material  by a dwarf with the [[Bone carver|Bone Carving]], [[Stonecrafting]], or [[Woodcrafting]] [[labor]]s enabled.

The craftsdwarf's workshop is the cornerstone of [[trading|trade]] in ''Dwarf Fortress''. All crafts can be traded for [[food]], [[alcohol]], [[weapon]]s, and other goods. Many crafts can also be acquired by dwarves as personal items, displayed on [[pedestal]]s, or used in activities like drinking, music, and play. Various goods, [[furniture]] and [[bolt]]s can also be [[decoration|decorated]] with [[bone]], [[pearl]], [[horn]], [[ivory]], or [[shell]]s to increase their [[value]]. 

Other crafts are more directly useful to your fortress: [[tool]]s such as [[large pot]]s, [[jug]]s, and [[nest box]]es can be created at this workshop. Large pots, particularly, can serve as a plentiful replacement for [[wood]]en [[barrel]]s in most circumstances. 

The craftsdwarf's workshop can also be used to create [[armor]] from bone or shell, make [[bolt]]s from [[wood]] or bone, assemble rock [[short sword]]s from [[obsidian]] and [[wood]], and extract strands of [[adamantine]] for refinement.

==Ammo==
Trees and the bones of butchered or slaughtered animals provide a plentiful and renewable source of material for ammunition.  When making [[wood]] bolts, a single log produces a stack of 25 bolts.  When making [[bone]] bolts, an entire stack of bones is brought to the workshop, and then ''one'' bone from that stack becomes a stack of 5 bolts.

==Armor==
Bone or shell armor, while vastly inferior to [[metal]] [[armor]], is still better than nothing.  Only 4 armor parts may be made from bone: leggings, greaves, gauntlets and helms.  Only 3 parts may be made from shell: leggings, gauntlets and helms.

Making bone leggings or greaves requires 3 stack of bones, but it only consumes 1 bone from each stack.  (You cannot use a stack of 3 bones instead.  There must be 3 separate stacks.)  Making bone gauntlets consumes 1 bone from 1 stack, and produces both a right and a left gauntlet.  Making a bone helm consumes 1 bone from 1 stack.

==Notes==
* The name of this workshop is actually derived from the {{token|PROFESSION_NAME|c|CRAFTSMAN}} value specified for your fortress's primary race - for example, if you were to use [[mod]]s to play as [[human]]s, this would be called a "Craftsman's Workshop" instead.
*Most crafting jobs require the respective labors, however; [[shell]], [[ivory]], tooth, [[horn]], and [[pearl]] are all worked by [[Bone carver|Bone Carvers]].
*[[Metal]] crafts are made at a [[metalsmith's forge]]. You can, however, make crafts out of metal '''ores''' by enabling the appropriate nugget use in the {{K|z}} [[Stone]] menu. This will result in fewer crafts, but [[quality]] modifiers may offset the difference in value.
*Other [[cloth]] and [[leather]] items are made at a [[clothier's shop]] or [[leather works]], respectively.
*[[strange mood|Moody]] dwarves without a moodable skill will claim a craftsdwarf's workshop and produce a legendary stone, wood, or bone craft.
*Multi-part [[Instrument]]s can be assembled here (assumed that single-part bone/thread/stone instruments can as well)
* Instrument pieces can be made here from bone, thread, and stone.
