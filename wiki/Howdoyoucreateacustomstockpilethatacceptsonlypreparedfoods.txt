On the stock{{k|p}}ile menu, select {{k|t}} for Custom Settings. Disable all categories except "Food" and "Additional Options" (press {{k|d}} on each other category), then highlight "Food" and press {{k|b}} to disable everything classified as food. Finally, press {{k|u}} to enable the "Prepared Food" option on the lower right. Now hit {{k|Esc}} and draw your custom prepared food stockpile as normal. 

Note that some [[stack]]s of prepared food are too large to fit in a [[barrel]] (or [[pot]]), so it is advisable to limit the total number of barrels in the stockpile (from the {{k|q}}uery menu, press {{k|e}} to reduce Max Barrel) to ensure that you always have a few barrel-free stockpile tiles for oversize meal stacks. (Dwarves are not smart enough to move an empty barrel to store a stack of 300+ masterful roasts, let alone consolidate partially-full barrels to make room.)
