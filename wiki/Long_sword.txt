A '''long sword''' is an [[attack types|edged]] [[weapon]] that is more than twice the size of a [[short sword]], but still 30% smaller than a [[two-handed sword]]. While not as powerful as a [[two-handed sword]], it has the potential to be used in one hand, making it a better defensive option, as the other hand retains the ability to use a [[shield]]. Long swords have the same basic attacks as other swords, but benefit from increased damage potential over short swords.

Long swords use and train the [[swordsdwarf]] skill. As foreign weapons, dwarves cannot [[forge]] long swords, limiting supply to whatever low-[[quality]] specimens can be traded from human [[caravan]]s or scavenged from invaders. 

Although longer than standard short swords, most dwarves are still [[Weapon#Size|able to equip]] long swords. With height and broadness modifiers, some dwarves ''should'' be unable to use a long sword, and a few others might only manage to do so two-handed. Currently, due to a [[#Bugs|bug]], long swords can be equipped by all dwarves, no matter their size.

==Bugs==
In fortress mode, one-handed vs. two-handed checks are performed correctly, but can wield vs. can't wield ignores height and broadness modifiers, so all dwarves can equip long swords.{{Bug|0005812}} See [http://www.bay12forums.com/smf/index.php?topic=119068.msg3790913#msg3790913 this] forum post for details.
