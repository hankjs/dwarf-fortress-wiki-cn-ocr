'''Kakapo men''' are humanoid versions of the common [[kakapo]] and a [[Creature|species]] of unremarkable [[animal people]], found in some [[savage]] [[temperate]] biomes. They are only a little over half the size of an adult [[dwarf]] and are unlikely to pose a threat to a fortress' inhabitants.

Like other savage animal people, kakapo men may occasionally join [[civilization]]s, becoming full-fledged citizens who may appear in your fortress as [[visitor]]s or be playable in [[adventurer mode]].

Some dwarves [[Preferences|like]] kakapo men for their ''longevity'', their ''flightlessness'', and their ''booming calls''.
