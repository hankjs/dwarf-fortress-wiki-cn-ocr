The '''Clothier's shop''' is a [[workshop]] used by a [[Clothier]] to make [[clothes]], [[rope]]s and [[bag]]s. It can use [[cloth]] made from plant fibers, wool cloth made from [[yarn]] or [[silk]] cloth made from collected spider webs as raw materials. It can also be used to [[decoration|sew images]] onto [[finished goods]]. Cloth and silk must be either bought from [[trading|caravans]] or [[weaver|woven]] at a [[loom]].

The clothier's shop can be built with any building material, and must be built by a [[dwarf]] with the Clothesmaking [[labor]] enabled.

To create differently sized clothing, request it to be made from the workshop as usual, by adding a new task directly, or through a work order. If you added a task, click on [[File:Mag glass icon.png]] icon of the task and select 'Specify size'. Then you can specify the particular race you want to make the clothing item for. Similarly for work orders, you click [[File:Mag glass icon.png]] icon of the work order to select the size.

To specify the cloth sub-type of the clothing item, click [[File:Mag glass icon.png]] and select 'Specify cloth'.

Note that although cloth/silk backpacks and quivers exist, they cannot be made by the player.

Curiously, the name of this workshop will change if your fortress's primary race provides a custom value for the {{token|PROFESSION_NAME|c|CLOTHIER}} token.

==Quirks==
Although fabric made from animal products is called "wool cloth," to use wool cloth at the clothier, you must select "make clothes from yarn" in the job menu. This will still use wool cloth, not yarn thread.

The Clothier will ignore cloth in bins, therefore; it is better to make a stockpile of cloth that doesn't permit bins!
