'''Papyrus sedge''' is an [[aboveground]] [[crop]]. It can be used to make [[Paper industry|paper]] sheets at a [[farmer's workshop]] without the need to be milled into a slurry first.{{version|0.42.01}} Otherwise, it's useless &ndash; it's neither edible, millable, nor cookable.

Some [[dwarves]] [[Preferences|like]] papyrus sedges for their ''useful stems''.

== Technical information ==

Papyrus sedge [[Item token#PLANT|plants]] use the <code>[REACTION_CLASS:PAPER_PLANT]</code> [[Reaction#Reaction classes and products|class]] to allow them to be turned directly from plants to paper.
