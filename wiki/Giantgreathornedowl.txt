'''Giant great horned owls''' are the [[giant animal]] version of the standard [[great horned owl]]. They are roughly ten times the size of their smaller counterparts. Despite being giant, they do not produce substantial amounts of [[meat]] when [[Butcher|butchered]]. Much like their smaller cousins, they are not a particularly large threat to dwarves, and are born with Legendary skill in [[climbing]], can be in [[cage traps]], can be trained to be cheap exotic pets and (if female) can lay a meager amount of eggs. Due to their massive size, they can be exotic [[mount]]s.

Some dwarves [[like]] giant great horned owls for their ''ear tufts'' and ''piercing yellow eyes''.
