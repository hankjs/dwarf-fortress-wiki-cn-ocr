'''Giant gila monsters''' are over one hundred times larger than normal [[gila monster]]s and produce more [[food]] - sadly, not 100 times as much food. Gila monsters lie between a [[tiger]] and a [[lion]] in size, and are not aggressive, so can be hunted for food: they do have a ''mostly'' harmless bite however, causing mild pain and swelling. They only appear one a time, however, and so cannot easily be made into the founding members of an exotic [[egg production|egg farm]]. Some dwarves prefer them for their "venomous bite" and "coloration".

==In Real Life==

Giant Gila Monsters were thought not to exist until a gripping film of an attack in the American midwest in 1959 revealed that they did exist and that they look an awful lot like regular Gila Monsters crawling on a model train set.
<!-- Reference: King Gizzard and the Lizard Wizard -->

Contrary to stories told by [[human]] bards, giant gila monsters cannot be summoned by [[necromancer]]s, nor can they turn into winged, fire breathing [[forgotten beast]]s after consuming enough of them
