'''Pixies''' are a very common type of [[fanciful]] above-ground [[vermin]] that live in [[good]] areas. They drift in the air in faintly glowing, colorful groups, dancing intricately. (Repetitive music and recreational pixie dust use are likely involved.)  They, alongside [[Fairy|fairies]], are the only intelligent vermin in the game, though they can't be interacted with on the basis of being vermin. When encountered in [[adventure mode]], they will glow in the dark (''or should, if not for their fairy associates' identical technical issue''). While they possess a [[pet]] value of 10, they can't be captured with [[animal trap]]s.

Contrary to their {{token|DESCRIPTION|c}} (and Premium graphics), pixies don't actually have wings in their {{token|BODY|c}} definition at all, though they are still capable of flying anyways. A nearby comment in the raws suggests that [[Main:Toady One|Toady]] plans to eventually give them lacy wings.

While a token in their creature raws should enable swarms of these creatures to generate light, they cannot, as they lack the necessary graphical tokens and sprite creature graphics to do so.

Some [[dwarves]] [[Preferences|like]] pixies for their ''shifting colors'' and their ''intricate aerial dances''.
