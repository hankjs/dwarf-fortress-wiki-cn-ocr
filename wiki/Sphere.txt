[[File:Spheres_connection_graph.png|thumb|300px|right|A graph showing the connections between all the spheres. A thin line represents a friendship, a thick line a parent/child-relationship, and a red line preclusion.]]A '''sphere''', or '''cosmic principle''', is an aspect where a being has influence. [[Deity|Deities]], [[force]]s, [[angel]]s, [[demon]]s, [[megabeast]]s, [[semi-megabeast]]s, [[forgotten beast]]s and [[titan]]s may be associated with one or more spheres, and [[civilization]]s may prefer certain spheres when selecting creatures to worship. There are currently a total of 130 spheres.

Ancient artifacts known as [[primordial remnant]]s are connected to spheres, taking a unique form and granting powers depending on the sphere they're connected to.

==Understanding spheres==
A being such as a [[deity]], [[demon]] or [[megabeast]] may come to represent or epitomize certain things like emotions, qualities, terrain types, and items, which are called "spheres". As an example from real-world mythology, the Greek goddess [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Athena Athena] is goddess in the "spheres" of wisdom, warfare, handicrafts and reason.

Gods and adored megabeasts can grant secrets related to their spheres. In unmodded ''Dwarf Fortress'', this means that death gods can teach the secret of life and death to their worshipers, turning them into [[necromancer]]s. If those gods also happen to be associated with nightmares, they can grant the ability to summon [[bogeymen]] and [[nightmare]]s as well.

Dwarves and other creatures will come to worship certain "powerful beings" and, as such, will follow the "religion", and have a relationship with its "deity".

A [[historical figure]] with associated spheres that generates in the wild, or as a god, will be named after its spheres. So a death-aligned demon will be able to raise dead, and should they rule an entity, they will convert the surrounding regions into evil-aligned undead-raising biomes. Nightmare-aligned demons can summon bogeymen and nightmares. The [[Language#language_SYM.txt|symbols]] associated with the sphere will be used to generate first names, compound names, and titles. If an [[interaction]] from a deity creates an [[artifact]], then that artifact will be named using the spheres of the god who gave the blessing.

==Creatures with pre-determined spheres==
While many procedurally generated creatures in ''Dwarf Fortress'' are given random spheres upon creation, there are others who have static spheres, which remain constant across all save files:

*[[Bogeyman]]: Misery, night, nightmares
*[[Bronze colossus]]: Metals, strength, war
*[[Cyclops]]: Light, longevity, minerals, strength, thunder
*[[Dragon]]: Fire, wealth
*[[Ettin]]: Speech, strength
*[[Experiment]]: Deformity, night
*[[Giant]]: Food, strength
*[[Hydra]]: Muck, rebirth, strength
*[[Minotaur]]: Caverns, chaos, darkness, deformity, strength
*[[Nightmare]]: Misery, night, nightmares
*[[Roc]]: Hunting, sky, wind
*[[Werebeast]]: Animals, chaos, moon, night
*[[Night troll]]: Death, Night

==Sphere tokens==
{{Modding}}
According to Toady: "''Spheres have a parent/child list, a friend list, and a preclude list. A deity has either one or two base spheres, and then they pick friends of those spheres, while never choosing a precluded or parent/child sphere of any of the spheres they already have. I tried to be pretty lax with the preclude list so that interesting relationships could pop up.''"

[[Creature token#SPHERE|Creatures]] and [[Inorganic material definition token#SPHERE|inorganic materials]] can be assigned spheres with the [SPHERE:] token.

A [[Interaction token#IS_SPHERE|secret]] uses any number of [IS_SPHERE] tokens to determine what spheres it is available to.
