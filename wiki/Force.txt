A [[force]] is an abstract entity that acts as the equivalent of [[Deity|deities]] for [[Civilization#Forest|forest civilizations]].

These civilizations each worship their own corresponding force that permeates their surrounding area. Though no new [[religion]]s can be founded around a force, each nation is lead by a [[druid]].

Forces are generally associated with nature-related [[sphere]]s, such as [[river]]s. An unmodded game only has [[forest]]-based forces: they, as most of the [[biome]]s, are also associated with nature and rivers. If the biome has no plants (trees, grasses etc.), the force will be associated with animals instead of nature. The second sphere of the force is defined by its terrain feature, in most biomes it is rivers, but in mountain biome it is mountains, in any lake biome it is lakes, in any ocean it is oceans, when glacier and tundra have no second sphere.

Forces, unlike deities, never act in any way in the current version - they will never curse anyone, grant [[slab]]s etc. [[Elf|Elves]] typically pray to forces, and sometimes write [[book]]s about them as a way to glorify them. This may result in a single force having literally hundreds of books authored after them. Interestingly, elves that were turned into [[night troll]]s will continue worshipping forces and writing books about them from their [[lair]]s.
