'''Hedgehog men''' are [[animal people]] variants of the common [[hedgehog]] who can be found in [[savage]] [[temperate]] [[shrubland]]s and [[savanna]]s. They spawn in groups of 1-5 individuals and can curl up into a ball-shape which drastically increases the defense of the creature against [[Attack_types#Blunt_weapons|blunt damage]], causing it only to take damage to the [[Anatomy#Upper_Body|upper body]]. In terms of size, they are a little over half the weight of the average [[dwarf]].

Like other savage animal people, they can join [[civilization]]s, become [[historical figure]]s, appear as [[visitor]]s and be playable in [[adventurer mode]].

Some dwarves [[Preferences|like]] hedgehog men for their ''many spines''.

== Bugs ==
If a curled-up or retracted creature dies, and is then reanimated by a necromancer, it retains the effects of being curled-up, but can move and attack as normal. As a result, for example an undead echidna is invulnerable to destruction{{bug|11463}}. It combines well with a separate bug that allows curled-up undead to attack{{bug|10519}}.

As a result, the undead echidna may at the same time be curled-up (making it unkillable) and move/attack. The same problem also affects the [[echidna man]], [[giant echidna]] and [[giant hedgehog]].

Modding the game and removing [PREVENTS_PARENT_COLLAPSE] from the spine body part of the affected animals will allow them to be pulped and killed while curled up. While it makes normal echidnas weaker, this is not a major problem, as echidnas are not supposed to be really hard to kill. This workaround [http://www.bay12forums.com/smf/index.php?topic=175473.msg8111524#msg8111524 may restore otherwise unplayable games].

It was also reported that in adventure mode "I was able to finally kill the zombie by lighting fires underneath him/around him then waiting for a long time; eventually he 'died in the heat.'"{{bug|10519}}.

<!-- Reference: Sonic the Hedgehog -->
Contrary to popular belief, hedgehog men cannot exceed the speed of sound while running. They do not need to collect [[gold|golden]] rings to sustain their own life, and will not instantly die if struck by an enemy whilst without these rings. They also do not have a rivalry with intellectual [[villain|villainous]] [[human]]s.
