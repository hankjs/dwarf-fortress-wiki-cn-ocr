'''Tapirs''' are [[creature]]s who inhabit [[tropical]] moist broadleaf [[forest]]s. Weighing over three times more than a [[dwarf]], they spawn individually and meander the area, paying no mind to other creatures. Tapirs are benign herbivores and will flee from attackers, but if cornered they may attempt to defend themselves with kicks and bites. In [[adventurer mode]], they are more easily sighted at twilight and at night. A baby tapir is called a ''tapir calf''.

Tapirs can be captured in [[cage]] [[trap]]s and [[Animal trainer|trained]] into [[pet]]s of respectable value. They are [[grazer]]s and therefore require a [[pasture]] to survive after being trained, but are distinct for being one of the only exotic sources of [[milk]] and [[cheese]] (the other being the [[kangaroo]]). Because of their size, they produce a good amount of returns when [[butcher]]ed, making the idea of a tapir farm an attractive one for the long term. Tapirs reach their full size at 2 years of age and therefore should be butchered at that point for maximum returns.

Some dwarves [[Preferences|like]] tapirs for their ''floppy noses''.
