[[File:Dark pit 4.png|thumb|A gateway to the Underworld.]]

'''Underworld spires''' are huge [[slade]] structures created in [[Calendar|times before time]]. [[Demon]]s will create these sites as a bridge between the mortal world and the [[Underworld]] and rule from their spire, then perform a special [[vault|ritual]] with a [[deity]] to establish a permanent presence in the world. Underworld spires very often serve as the center of [[dark fortress]]es.

The spires constitute, if not ''are'', the main towers of dark fortresses. They can be accessed by an entrance at ground level guarded by [[goblin]]s, [[troll]]s, and [[beak dog]]s. Going upwards will lead to the throne room which houses the demon or goblin master. Traversing downwards will uncover several levels of long tunnels with prison cells containing kidnapped [[children]]. Below, past the prisons, are incredibly deep, enormous, circular open halls with a long series of treacherous, winding stairways and ramps that lead further downward - often at least a hundred levels. At the very end will be a strange, purple staircase simply named as an "Underworld Gate". Beyond the portal are the lowermost series of rooms which eventually open up directly to the Underworld, where there will be demons waiting to have [[fun]].

If your character comments on the [[weather]] or the natural surroundings while in a spire, they will mention an [[Underworld|eerie glow]].
