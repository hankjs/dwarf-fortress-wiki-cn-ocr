'''Exotic pets''' (creatures with the PET_EXOTIC [[creature token#P|token]]) require additional time and effort to [[tame]]. Dwarven civilizations generally start with little or no knowledge of how to tame exotic pets, resulting in poorly-trained creatures until your [[animal trainer]] develops the necessary knowledge through practice.

A safe (but slow) way to gain knowledge taming exotic pets is to simply leave them in their [[cage]]s. Their (poor-quality) training will quickly expire, and an animal trainer will perform the initial training task over and over again, gaining knowledge with each attempt. This is also a safe way to gain knowledge from creatures who cannot successfully be tamed (such as captured [[mount]]s and named enemies). 

Note that [[elf|elves]] appear to have no trouble training exotic pets; the elven [[caravan]] will regularly offer fully-tame exotic pets for trade.
