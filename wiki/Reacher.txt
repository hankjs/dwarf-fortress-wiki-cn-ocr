{{creaturedesc}}

'''Reachers''' are [[evil]]-aligned humanoid [[creature]]s found in subterranean [[cavern]]s, from the second layer downwards. They spawn one at a time and lurk the underground, occasionally pathing to your fortress and attacking [[dwarves]] who may cross their way. Reachers stand at the size of a [[human]] and may prove a threat to civilians, but an equipped [[military]] squad will make quick work of them. Despite being humanoid in anatomy, reachers are animals and can be freely [[butcher]]ed and eaten by your dwarves.

Despite their description, reachers are not able to feign death, nor do they live near [[water]]. Reachers possess a [[pet]] value of 100, but lack the necessary tokens to be [[Animal trainer|trainable]]. They can't be spawned in the [[object testing arena]].

Some dwarves [[Preferences|like]] reachers for their ''sinister nature''.

<!-- Reference: The "Witch" special infected from the Left 4 Dead games. -->
Female reachers spend most of their time sitting down, crying in the corners of abandoned [[human]] buildings. If a light is shown in their direction, they will attack wildly.


<!-- Reference:"Enigma of Amigara Fault" by Junji Ito.-->
Some claim to have seen [[humans]] climbing into oddly human-shaped holes in cliff faces, only to emerge as reachers from distorted holes elsewhere. As these supposed holes have yet to be directly observed by any reputable source, this is as-yet unsubstantiated.
