[[File:v50_announcements_preview.png|thumb|250px|right|List of announcements.]]An '''announcement''' is a message displayed at the top left of the game screen used to indicate something important. Major announcements will pause gameplay and center the camera on the event in question, and game-changing ones will both do that and provide a framed message box presenting the event in question. The announcements list ({{Menu icon|N}}) lists all game announcements in dated order; some (but not all) can be zoomed to. (<!-- may be more confusing than helpful for v50 but leaving it for now -->Announcements are not to be confused with [[reports]], which detail combat results.)

When some major or important game-changing announcements occur, the following icon will appear, accompanied with a wooden ticking-like sound effect:<br>

== Controlling which announcements pause and recenter ==
{{main|announcements.txt}}

You can control which types of announcements do and don't pause and/or recenter the game in the [[Settings#Announcements|Announcements tab of Settings]] or by editing the <code>announcements.txt</code> file.  
==== Announcement Settings ====
To change the behavior of announcements via the in game Settings, open [[Settings]], select the [[Settings#Announcements|Announcements]] tab. Then you'll need to find the setting of interest ([[announcements.txt#List_of_announcements|announcements.txt wiki page]] may be able to help). You'll see the available options for each event includes, <code>Popup</code>, <code>Pause</code>, <code>Recenter</code>, and <code>Alert</code>. That's the functionality you're most likely to want to adjust. For example, if you want an Alert on the left side of the screen for combat strikes and wounds you would scroll down to 'Strike' and 'Wounds' and change the Alert column to 'Yes' - but don't get ambitious and change all the combat events to Alert, you'll regret it! (one at a time is recommended). More information on what each of these options do, including <code>Adv</code>, <code>Fort</code>, <code>Report</code>, and <code>Report (Active)</code> is available on the [[announcements.txt]] wiki page (and probably needs to become shared content between these two pages).

==== announcements.txt ====
To change the behavior of announcements via the <code>announcements.txt</code> file you'll need to adjust the <code>:options</code> for the particular event of interest. An announcement type containing ''''':P''''' will pause when that announcement type is made, and one containing ''''':R''''' will re-center when that announcement type is made.  For example,

:<tt>[MIGRANT_ARRIVAL:A_D:D_D:P:R]</tt>

means that the game will pause and recenter upon the announcement of migrants arriving.  You could change it to

:<tt>[MIGRANT_ARRIVAL:A_D:D_D:R]</tt>

to cause the game to recenter on the arriving migrants, but to not pause the game.

'''Note:'''
* <code>/init/announcements.txt</code> is for the '''Default''' settings
* <code>/prefs/announcements.txt</code> is for the '''Current''' settings

''Game-changing'' announcements are among the most important in the game. When these announcements occur, they pause the game, zoom to the location, ''and'' present a message box detailing the occurrence, in addition to repeating the message contained therein in the main feed after you close the box, for good measure. These are also reserved for incredibly rare, and potentially once-in-a-playthrough events.{{spoil small|[[File:Eerie cavern.png|center|500px]]|An example of a game-changing announcement, in ASCII mode.}}|-|[[File:announce_masterpiece_icon.png]] || style="background:#ff4141; color:white; text-align:center" | Important || The creation of an [[artifact]], whether from a [[strange mood]] or from a [[soldier]] bestowing a name upon his/her equipment.|-|[[File:announce_digging_icon.png]] || style="background:#ff4141; color:white; text-align:center" | Important || Discovering a [[cavern]] layer or the [[magma sea]]|-|[[File:announce_attack_icon.png]] || style="background:#ff4141; color:white; text-align:center" | Important || The arrival of a siege.|-|[[File:announce_general_icon.png]] || style="background:#ff4141; color:white; text-align:center" | Important || Your fortress becomes the capital.|-|[[File:announce_monster_icon.png]] || style="background:#ff4141; color:white; text-align:center" | Important || The arrival of a [[megabeast]], [[titan]], [[forgotten beast]], transformed [[werebeast]], or an [[undead]] siege.|-|[[File:announce_monster_icon.png]] || style="background:#ff4141; color:white; text-align:center" | Important || The reveal of a [[demon]], [[angel]], artifacts, or fire in an [[Unusual volcanic wall]]|-|[[File:announce_digging_icon.png]] || style="background:#ff4141; color:white; text-align:center" | Important || Discovering a [[deep pit]], [[magma pool]], or downward passage in a cavern.|-|[[File:announce_digging_icon.png]] || style="background:#ff4141; color:white; text-align:center" | Important || Discovering [[adamantine]] - Praise the miners!|-|[[File:announce_digging_icon.png]] || style="background:#ff4141; color:white; text-align:center" | Important || Discovering the [[Underworld]].|-|[[File:announce_holdings_icon.png]] || style="background:#ff4141; color:white; text-align:center" | Important || An area has been founded, and is incorporated into your fortress' holdings.|}
