[[File:boulder_icon_large.png|right]]A '''boulder''' is a [[map tile]] that occurs randomly across the surface of the world, which represent fragments of the substrate [[stone]] layer. {{token|BOULDER|i}} is also the [[item token]] for an ordinary [[stone|large rock]] (as opposed to a small rock), usually obtained from [[mining]].

== Removal ==
Aside from serving no utility whatsoever in [[fortress mode]], they can impede the movement of [[wagon]]s (but can be walked over by [[dwarves]] and other [[creature]]s{{cite talk|v0.34:Boulder|Ability to walk over boulders}}). To remove a boulder, press {{menu icon|v}} and choose s{{k|m}}ooth stone, designate the boulder, and an [[engraver]] will turn the boulder into a smooth [[floor]]. The resulting floor is the material of the boulder, rather than the surrounding material of the ground that the boulder was on.   Alternatively, you can place and then remove a [[construction]] on the boulder's tile, which will typically change the tile into a [[soil]] floor.

==Notes==
*In ASCII mode, boulders covered in "a pile of [[snow]]" are '''not''' visible unless looked at.  When viewed from one z-level up, however, they will appear as {{DFtext|.}} (a period) instead of the {{DFtext|·}} representing open space.

== Adventure mode ==
In [[adventure mode]], a boulder cannot be interacted with, and acts like any other open ground.
