'''Hammerhead sharks''' are large [[Cartilage|cartilaginous]] [[Creature#Aquatic|fish]] that can be found in [[tropical]] and [[temperate]] [[ocean]]s. Adult hammerheads are enormous, nearly nine times the size of an average [[dwarf]], and as such provide a great amount of [[meat]] when [[butcher]]ed. As fully-sized creatures, they can't be fished by [[Fisherdwarf|fisherdwarves]], but can be caught with a [[drowning chamber]]. An infant hammerhead shark is called a ''hammerhead shark pup''.

Being cartilaginous, hammerhead sharks won't give [[bone]]s if butchered (though they'll still provide a [[skull]]).

Some dwarves [[Preferences|like]] hammerhead sharks for their ''oddly-shaped heads''.
