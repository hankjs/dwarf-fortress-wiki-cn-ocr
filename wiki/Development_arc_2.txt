In earlier days of ''Dwarf Fortress'', development was split up into outlined specific '''Arcs'''. That system has been replaced by a short list of future releases given names after their main focus by [[Toady One]].

== Named Releases ==
=== Future ===
==== Next ====
* "another routine patch" with [https://dwarffortressbugtracker.com/view_all_bug_page.php?filter=695c33a116bf3 general bugfixes]
* A second siege release focused "[[Release_information/53.07#What.27s_Next_for_Sieges.3F|on magic, armies, and diplomacy]]".
==== Later ====
* The adventure mode site building: the return of [[Camp#Adventurer_camps|camp founding and building]], plus more "cross-mode play and Adventure mode crafting".
* The map rewrites: A rework of the generated spaces and regions, allowing for more dynamic and reactive worlds, with changes focused on the underground, but also some changes above. It has been previously known as the "Big Wait" before myth and magic, but is planned to be released incrementally alongside smaller magical features.
* More villains releases: the continuation of the villains release, finishing what was left when focus shifted to the premium release, divided into multiple smaller releases.
* More myth and magic, world changes, "probably through covens and religion", starting scenarios, and civilization improvements.

=== Possible Future ===
These are things that have been discussed as future releases, but have not been officially announced.
* More [[Lua]] functionality, including UI exposure to allow for more mouse versus keyboard control flexibility.
* The boats release: will feature, well, boats, with all that entails (ports, maritime trade routes, pirates, and so on). Probably multi-tile creatures as well, as mechanics on how to make boats (floating superstructures) work will be borrowed to make multi-tile creatures as well.
* The economy release: will piggyback on the new trade and property stuff to establish a new framework that will completely overhaul the old (and deactivated) [[economy]] system.

=== Past ===
* The [[night creature]] release ([[v0.34:Release_information|0.34.01]]): added [[necromancer]]s, [[mummy|mummies]], [[vampire]]s, [[werebeast]]s as well as a complete [[undead]] overhaul. Other notable additions include evil [[weather]], improved human [[site]]s featuring [[catacombs]], [[sewer]]s and [[dungeon]]s, and a number of animals added to the game.
* The [[World activities|world activation]] release ([[DF2014:Release_information/0.40.01|0.40.01]]): allowed many [[world generation]] activities to carry on during normal gameplay, as opposed to a static world. Other notable additions include non-human [[site]]s, multi-tile trees, retireable fortresses, claimable non-player fortresses and a great variety of plants and additional animal people.
* The [[tavern]] release ([[DF2014:Release_information/0.42.01|0.42.01]]): added taverns and [[visitor]]s to the game. Other notable additions include fortress [[temple]]s, [[library|libraries]] (with [[scholar]]s complete with a [[knowledge]] system), a [[paper]] industry, art forms (music, dance and writing) and non-dwarven citizens.
* The [[artifact]] release ([[DF2014:Release_information/0.44.01|0.44.01]]): added non-player artifacts to the game. Other notable additions include the ability to send [[squad]]s of dwarves off the map (on [[mission]]s to raid sites, rescue citizens, retrive artifacts, explore ruins and so on), secret [[agent]]s, non-player [[quester]]s and improved [[kobold]] sites.
* The [[villain]]s release (first part) ([[DF2014:Release_information/0.47.01|0.47.01]]): added villains to the game, giving them goals and the ability to subvert other people into various corruption activities such as embezzlement, sabotage, kidnapping or assassination. Other notable additions included improved relationships (divorce and remarriage, children outside marriage, different kinds of friendships), improved religions (featuring prophets and monastic orders), trade companies, craft guilds, new sites (monasteries, bandit forts and the return of castles) as well as several new [[night creature]]s. This release was cut short, leaving out most of the [[cv:fortress mode|fortress mode]] and [[cv:adventure mode|adventure mode]] villainy, to hasten the Premium release.
* The Premium release (or the Steam release) ([[Release_information/50.01|50.01]]): the first commercial release of ''Dwarf Fortress''.  also known as ''Dwarf Fortress Premium''. As the primary commercial platform is [https://store.steampowered.com/app/975370/Dwarf_Fortress/ Steam], it is also known as the Steam release, though it is also available on [https://kitfoxgames.itch.io/dwarf-fortress itch.io]. It included a complete overhaul of UI and graphics, bug fixes, as well as an official pixel-art [[graphics set]]. A concurrent free version is still available as ''Dwarf Fortress Classic'' (Available on 12/22/22 since version 50.04 at [https://bay12games.com/dwarves/ Bay 12 Games]), which has feature parity but not the official graphics set.
* The adventure release ([[Release_information/51.01|51.01]]): Re-enables [[Adventurer mode]] with a new interface and additional graphics. Added [[:Category:Myth|mythical]] features such as [[chosen]] adventurers and [[mysterious dungeon]]s.
* The initial Lua scripting release ([[Release_information/52.01|52.01]]): Exposed previously hard-coded "procedural object generation, like the forgotten beasts, divine curses (vampires and werebeasts), divine items, necromancers and their lieutenants and experiments, evil weather, and so forth."
* The first siege release ([[Release_information/53.01|53.01]]): An improvement of [[siege]]s, with a focus on more intelligent invader tactics, balanced [[trap]]s, and updated [[siege engine]]s.

== Old arcs ==
''Dwarf Fortress'' development has moved away from the old large arc based strategy. The old [[Consolidated Development]] page lists 21 "short-term arcs" and 15 "long-term arcs". Not all arcs would have taken take the same length of time to complete. Each arc also encompassed certain cores, requirements, bloats, and power goals.

Here are a few notable ones:
*[[Army arc]]: possibly the biggest endeavor out of all the current arcs, it was never fully completed. Version 0.31.01 introduced many army arc features.
*[[Caravan arc]]: another famous arc, focusing on fleshing out the caravans (Status unknown as of v0.47.05, may have been completed.)
*[[County arc]]
*[[Life cycle arc]]
*[[Presentation arc]]
