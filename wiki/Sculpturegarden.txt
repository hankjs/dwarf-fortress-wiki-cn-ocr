A '''sculpture garden''' is a [[meeting area]] containing at least one [[statue]], unengraved [[slab]] or [[museum]]. Sculpture gardens can be assigned to [[location]]s (such as a [[tavern]], [[temple]] or [[library]]) or left unassigned, for communal enjoyment. A communal (non-assigned) garden, being a meeting area, provides a place for idle dwarves and animals to congregate and socialize.

==Advantages over dining rooms==
The biggest advantage a sculpture garden has over a [[dining room]] is simplicity. Since dwarves are not going to eat in it, there is no need to build tables or chairs to accommodate them. As such, there is plenty of room to put in all sorts of [[item quality|valuable]] [[furniture]], which can give your dwarves positive [[emotion]]s – furthermore, all furniture in a sculpture garden will be "tastefully arranged", potentially increasing the dwarves' emotional responses. As well, since only a statue or slab is required, it is easy to create a sculpture garden outside. This is very useful to prevent [[cave adaptation]] and can double as an [[security design|early warning system]] against [[thief|thieves and snatchers]].

==Disadvantages==
Unassigned sculpture gardens don't possess the same interactivity and bonuses of [[location]]s. Having a sculpture garden separate from other locations ultimately comes down to player preference.

==Private gardens==

If a statue is placed in a private zone (assigned to a particular dwarf) it will increase the emotional response the owner gets from admiring the furniture inside it (on top of the existing bonus for being "tastefully arranged").
