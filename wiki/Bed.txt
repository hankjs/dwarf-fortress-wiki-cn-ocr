A '''bed''' is a piece of [[furniture]] manufactured in a [[carpenter's workshop]]. Once built a bed can be placed with {{Menu icon|b|f|b|sep=-}}. A bed not contained within a [[zone]] will be used by any roomless [[dwarf]]. Dwarves gain unhappy [[thoughts]] from [[sleep]]ing without a bed and happy thoughts from having their own, high-quality bedrooms, so building beds is often a necessity for a happy fortress.

[[File:beds v50.png|left|Top to bottom: wood, stone, and metal bedframes. Once made at a [[carpenter's workshop]], it will be complete with a pillow and a colored blanket!]]Unlike many other pieces of furniture, standard beds can only be created from [[wood]] (beds made of other materials such as [[metal]], [[stone]], [[gem]]s, or [[bone]] only exist in the form of [[legendary artifact]]s created during [[strange mood]]s). If your fortress has no surface [[tree]]s, you will have to bring wood with you, or rely on [[subterranean]] trees or [[trading|trade]] to get wood for beds. Manufacturing a bed requires one piece of [[wood]]. To construct a bed, click on a [[carpenter's workshop]], click on "Add new task", then click on "Make bed".

In the Premium version of ''Dwarf Fortress'', unlike most furniture, bed colors do not reflect material used. Instead, they are randomly colored from a wide spectrum of all standard ''Dwarf Fortress'' colors.

=== Your first beds ===
In the first season after [[embark]], your first dwarves will want to sleep sometime around 6 weeks after embark (around the 28th of the 2nd month by default), although the exact timing will vary between each dwarf. A beginning fortress might only need 4-5 beds for their initial 7 dwarves, although as time passes and their sleeping rhythms get more out of sync, that number drops.  Although a fortress of 100 dwarves might only need a dozen or so beds to accommodate all sleepers at any one time, by the time a fortress reaches that size, some private [[bedroom]]s will, most likely, be a good idea, and bedrooms can ''only'' be defined from a bed.

It's not a big deal for a dwarf to "sleep in the dirt" that first time, but doing so will create a negative [[thought]], and it will take a while for that thought to go away.  So, just in case more [[tantrum|bad thoughts]] arise later for some unlucky emo dwarf, it's always best to avoid them whenever you can. You almost certainly have [[Quickstart guide|better things to do]] than to dig out the perfect [[bedroom design|housing tract]] those first few weeks, so a few beds stuffed into some random corner should be more than good enough for your first seven.

=== (De-)Construction ===
Because beds may only be built [[indoors]], a bed on the surface will need to have a [[floor]] or [[wall]] built above it before it can be constructed.

Beds can be deconstructed even while a dwarf is sleeping in them, causing the dwarf to wake up.  See [[noise]], however.

=== Bed Assignments ===
[[File:bed_preview.png|thumb|300px|right|Not good enough for a noble.]]
Beds within a [[bedroom]] zone can be assigned to a specific dwarf by selecting the bedroom with the ({{Menu icon|z}}) zone menu open, then clicking the dwarf head with a plus sign. You can choose a dwarf from the list. Dwarves who already have assigned beds will have "Has ''Quality'' Quarters" written above their name.

You can (re-)assign or free (unassign) a bed, even if a dwarf is sleeping in it at the time.  The change in assignment will take effect when they wake up.  Each bed can only be assigned to one dwarf at a time, however. If, after you assign a dwarf their bed, you see two dwarves listed, don't panic - it's okay, they're [[marriage|married]], and will share that bed.  Married dwarves can sleep in the same bed at the same time (along with all 34 war dogs assigned to them).
