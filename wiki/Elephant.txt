'''Elephants''' are massive [[creature]]s who inhabit [[tropical]] [[shrubland]]s and [[forest]]s and the largest terrestrial mundane animals in the game. In past versions of the game, elephants were famed as [[23a:Elephant|cold, emotionless, and highly effective dwarf killing machines]], [[blood]] eternally dripping from their ivory tusks, the bane of even the mightiest of [[Main:Boatmurdered|fortresses]], so on and so forth. ([[Size]] used to be correlated with combat bonuses, both to damage and damage resistance, making them incredibly dangerous animals; today it just translates into more and thicker tissues.) Nonetheless, their sheer size means that they still pack a wallop, sufficient to rip apart even the most well-[[armor]]ed of [[goblin]]s with ease.

In the wild, elephants appear in clusters of 3-7 individuals, and—their size notwithstanding—can be caught by the same [[cage]] [[trap]]s as any other creature. Elephants may be [[domestic animal|domesticated]] by civilizations that settled in tropical regions during [[worldgen]]. Additionally, [[elf|elven]] [[caravan]]s may occasionally bring tame elephants with them, if they have settlements in the right locations - the method by which a 1,000 pound [[donkey]] carries a 15,000 pound elephant in a cage, on top of whatever else it's carrying, is a deeply veiled elven secret. [[Animal training|Trained]] elephants can be turned further into war and hunting roles (see below; no word yet on how elephant sneaking works, exactly), and are easily the most effective war animals that your fortress can train. In the future, it is planned that they will [[Grazing|graze]] upon trees for food, but for now they eat grass and cave moss like all other grazing animals.

If you plan on [[breeding]] elephants, note that elephant calves take 10 years to mature (though they reach full size in only 5 years). Pregnant elephants will give birth to 1-3 calves, and they have longer lives than most animals (50-70 years) as well. Even in death, elephants are wonderful creatures; once butchered, their products are worth ''five'' times as much as those of more boring animals (like [[cow]]s), and their great size means that there will be a ''lot'' of products.

Since they're "War Animals", "Hunting Animals" and "Exotic Mounts", they can also be fielded during sieges. They're used by Human, Elven and Dwarven siegers as tanks - essentially, as budget [[Cave dragon|cave dragons]].

Some [[dwarves]] [[Preferences|like]] elephants for their ''strength'', their ''amazing trunks'', their ''calves' spirited antics'', their ''tusks'', their ''great weight'', their ''social behavior'', their ''flappy ears'', their ''uprooting of trees'', their ''aggressive sparring'', their ''trumpeting'', their ''tool use'' and their ''self-awareness''. They have, by far, the most reasons to be liked by dwarves of all creatures in the game.

{{D for Dwarf}}
Every reader will be able to confirm not having ever seen an elephant trying to hide behind a [[tree]]. The most astute of these readers will realize that this is due to elephants having an innately sharp [[Ambusher|hiding]] ability.
