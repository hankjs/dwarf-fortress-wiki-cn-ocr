'''Black bronze''' is a semiprecious alloy of [[copper]], [[gold]] and [[silver]]. Unlike [[bronze|regular]] or [[bismuth bronze]], black bronze cannot be used to create [[weapon]]s or [[armor]], restricting its uses to [[Blacksmith|blacksmithing]] and [[Metal crafter|metalcrafting]] purposes. Black bronze cannot be [[Smelter|smelt]]ed directly from [[ore]], but only from [[bar]]s of pure [[metal]]s. Unlike some [[alloy]]s, the [[Item value|value]] of a bar of black bronze is equal exactly to the average value of its components – creating this alloy does not increase the total value of the material (2 [[copper]] bars at 10☼ each + 1 [[silver]] bar at 50☼ + 1 [[gold]] bar at 150☼ = 220☼/4 bars = 55☼/bar of black bronze).

== In real life ==
The actual composition and process of creating black Corinthian bronze has been lost to history, noted by the Roman author Pliny the Elder (AD 23/24 – AD 79), as is typical of closely guarded trade secrets of pre-industrial society. In Japan, a similar alloy of copper with gold, known as ''Shakudō'', was somewhat commonly used for [[decoration]] of luxury metal goods. Unlike the ancient Greek metal, however, this "black bronze" was never lost and is still produced in small quantities today.
