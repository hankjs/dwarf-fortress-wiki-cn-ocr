'''Centaurs''' are [[fanciful]] [[creature]]s which are merely the stuff of [[legends]]. They do not actually exist, appearing only in [[engraving]]s as the fancy of artists. A female centaur is known as a ''centauress''.

Some [[Dwarf|dwarves]] [[Preferences|like]] centaurs for their ''strength''.

==The "Centaur" Problem==

''"We've got the "centaur" problem, or whatever, where I wanna take any piece of anything, and slap it onto something else... That has complications in terms of the materials, and the body parts, and that kind of thing that need to be worked out."'' - [[Toady One]], [[Dwarf Fortress Talk]] #28 [38:26]
<br><br>
Procedurally [[Creature token#GENERATED|generating]] centaurs has been discussed since the days of ''Dwarf Fortress's'' predecessor, ''[[Armok|Slaves to Armok]]''. Combining two creature objects, such as a [[human]] with the lower body of a [[horse]], and respecting the [[raw file]]s and body structure of each component is a consideration that the nonexistent nature of the centaur and the other [[fanciful]] hybrid creatures allude to.

Though [[creature]]s like [[Merperson|merpeople]] and [[satyr]]s are conceptually hybrids, they are singular, manual implementations, rather than a system that can generate any number of [[Chimera|chimeric]] beings based on combining existing creatures. [[Experiment]]s are generated from an independent [[random creature profile]] rather than being based on their input creature.
