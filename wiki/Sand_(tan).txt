'''Tan sand''', simply known as '''sand''' in the game, is one of the several types of [[sand]] that can be found in [[soil layer]]s. Tan sand layers occasionally contain an [[aquifer]].

It can be gathered into [[bag]]s and used for the purpose of [[glassmaking]], and can also be used for [[farming]] just like any other [[soil]] layer.

Sand always appears as {{Tile|≈|6:0}} and {{Tile|~|6:0}} and cannot become furrowed like other soil.
