'''Alligator snapping turtles''' are [[amphibious]] and carnivorous [[creature]]s found in [[temperate]] [[lake]]s, [[river]]s and [[pool]]s, where they may appear one at a time. They are more formidable than their [[common snapping turtle]] cousins, being over twice heavier, making them larger than the average [[dwarf]]. If provoked, they will retaliate with bites, potentially leading to lost fingers or hands... or whole dwarves.

Alligator snapping turtles can be captured in [[cage]] [[trap]]s and [[Animal trainer|trained]] into cheap exotic [[pet]]s. Due to their larger size than [[common snapping turtle]]s, they make for a more attractive source of [[meat]] and [[bone]]s when [[butcher]]ed. They may also be placed in a [[nest box]] to lay [[egg]]s for [[cook]]ing.

Some dwarves like alligator snapping turtles for their ''vicious bites'' and their ''long necks''.
