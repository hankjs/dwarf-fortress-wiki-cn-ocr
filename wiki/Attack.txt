[[File:kill_icon_preview.png|right]]'''Attack''' is a command that can be given to military [[dwarves]], which instructs them to kill an individual.
== Fortress Mode ==
:''(See the [[Military]] article for a full discussion of how to manipulate squads and options with your military, like arming or armoring them, among many other important concepts. This article is for an unarmed, immediate response only, the most basic concept.)''

To issue a kill order, simply press {{Menu icon|q}}, select the military squad that will carry out the order, then click on the sword icon ([[File:Interface squad attack.jpg]]), then click the target. In some cases, a list of units will appear, with the player able to select and deselect enemy units.

== Adventure mode ==

Generally, there are multiple ways to attack in [[adventurer mode]]:
* '''Automatic''' - this is the typical roguelike method of moving with the movement keys towards an adjacent enemy; when moving towards a friendly unit you will swap places with them, instead. [[Combat#Combat_preferences|Combat preferences]] affect which attack types are chosen. Automatic attacks are referred to as "Attack" in the context menu.
* '''Manual''' - with {{Adv menu icon|A}} you can attack any specific adjacent creature in a specific way; you will need to confirm the attack if the creature is not already in conflict with you. This menu also offers some defensive actions, and can also be opened with "Combat" in the context menu.
* '''Wrestling''' - use {{Adv menu icon|W}} to choose from a variety of grabs or [[wrestling]] maneuvers on an adjacent creature.
* '''Ranged''' - using either {{Adv menu icon|f}} to fire a projectile with an equipped weapon such as a crossbow, or {{k|t}} to throw an object from your inventory.
* '''Powers''' or '''abilities''' - [[syndrome]]s (such as being an [[intelligent undead]]) can grant powers that can be used from the {{Adv menu icon|X}} menu (such as Ice Bolt, for example). Most creatures can [[spit]] from this menu, but that does nothing, except rarely escalate the [[level of conflict]].
* '''Jumping''' - using {{Adv menu icon|j}} and aiming for a creature usually results in them scrambling out of the way. If they are hit, it can send them flying and can cause injuries when they land. Unlike the other ways to attack, this does not technically count as an attack, so it will not escalate their [[level of conflict]].

An automatic or manual attack can be a weapon strike, shield bash, strike with a body part (such as punch, kick, scratch, bite, etc.), or [[wrestling]] move. A wrestling move starts with a grab, that can be followed by a takedown, throw, lock, break, choke, strangle, etc., depending on the grab.
