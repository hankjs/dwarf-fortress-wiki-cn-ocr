'''Tetrahedrite''' is an incredibly common [[ore]] of both [[copper]] and [[silver]]. [[Smelter|Smelting]] tetrahedrite will produce 4 copper [[bar]]s and 0-4 silver [[bar]]s*. On average, each nugget of tetrahedrite will produce less than one bar of silver when smelted.

: * There is a separate 20% chance for each of the 4 silver bars being produced. This works out to be an <u>average</u> of 0.8 silver bars each time a unit of tetrahedrite is smelted, with "no bars" or "1 bar" being equally common (40.96% of the time), 2 bars not uncommon (15.36% of the time), and 3 or 4 uncommon but not impossible (2.56% and 0.16%, respectively).

Tetrahedrite can also be used in [[alloy]] reactions requiring either a copper-bearing ore or a silver-bearing ore, but will only be used as a ''silver'' ore if no other silver ores are available. Two tetrahedrite nuggets can be smelted together as a copper-bearing ore and a silver-bearing ore to make eight [[billon]] bars for a roughly 70% increase in value compared to smelting the nuggets independently.

When using tetrahedrite as a copper-bearing ore, it's often best to smelt it into bars first and then use those copper bars to create the alloy. This allows you to produce some [[silver]] bars in addition to the bars of alloy, but does require additional [[fuel]] and time. A clear exception to this is when producing [[billon]] from two tetrahedrite nuggets, when the benefits of using tetrahedrite as a silver-bearing ore outweigh the drawbacks of using tetrahedrite as a copper-bearing ore.

==Understanding the value chain==
A single tetrahedrite boulder (seen in-game as simply "tetrahedrite", laying on the floor as a byproduct of [[miner|mining]]) has a [[Item value|value]] of 9 (3 for being a stone boulder, times 3 for it being tetrahedrite).

This boulder can be smelted into 4 bars of copper, each having a value of 10 (5 for being bars, times 2 for them being made of copper), for a total of 40, and a random amount of 0 to 4 bars of silver (mean being 0.8), each having a value of 50 (5 for being bars, times 10 for them being made of silver). So each single tetrahedrite boulder gives you a (mean) value of 80 in copper and silver bars. If you smelt two of them into billon instead, this yields 8 billon bars worth 30 each (5 for being bars, 6 for being made of billon), for a total of 240 value, i.e. 120 per boulder.

Each bar can be then [[Forge|forged]] into items, like a [[battle axe]]. A copper battle axe will have a value of 20 (10 for being a battle axe, times 2 for being made of copper), thus the original tetrahedrite boulder will yield a total value of 160 (80 from the 4 copper battle axes, plus 80 as a mean of the possible silver battle axes, each worth 100). This can be multiplied up to 2× since battle axes have [[quality]] levels.
