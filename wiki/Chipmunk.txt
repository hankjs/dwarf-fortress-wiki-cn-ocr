'''Chipmunks''' are a type of [[vermin]] found in [[temperate]] [[forest]]s in all seasons except winter. They can be captured by [[trapper]]s and turned into [[pet]]s. All chipmunks possess Legendary [[skill]] in [[Climber|climbing]].

Some dwarves [[Preferences|like]] chipmunks for their ''stripes''.
