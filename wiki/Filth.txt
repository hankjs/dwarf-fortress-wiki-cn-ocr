[[File:Filth preview.png|right]]

'''Filth''' is one of the more obscure [[material]]s present within the game code, as well as a [[smell]]. It comes in two varieties: solid brown and liquid yellow filth. Randomly generated creatures such as [[forgotten beast]]s may occasionally be composed of [[grime]] and filth, and it is currently unknown where filth can be encountered otherwise.

== Brown filth ==
This type of filth is a brown-colored solid. It does not melt, but gradually decomposes in [[temperature]]s above {{ct|10180}}. It has a [[density]] of 1200, slightly higher than [[water]].

== Yellow filth ==
Yellow-colored filth is a liquid that freezes at {{ct|10000}} and boils at {{ct|10180}}. It has a [[density]] of 920 when frozen and 1000 when liquid, exactly the same as [[water]].

===Dwarven poop===

It is true that dwarves do not poop, but they do have other means of... er... removing their waste. A famous dwarven doctor, Urist McIliedHeIsNotFamous, discovered that the average dwarf has an extremely efficient digestive system. Any tiny amount of waste that passes digestion will then be turned into - you guessed it - beard hair.
