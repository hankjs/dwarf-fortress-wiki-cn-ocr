[[File:campfire_anim_preview.gif|right]]'''Campfires''' can be created in [[adventurer mode]] by pressing {{Adv menu icon|g}}.  Currently, campfires do not require anything to build, although it has been indicated that in the future, there will be more work involved in their creation.

Walking into a tile containing a campfire is not possible, even for creatures immune to fire. [[jump|Jumping]] over and even onto a campfire is possible and harmless.

Campfires can't be destroyed &mdash; unless water flows onto them &mdash; but will disappear on their own after a few hours. Nearby natural ice walls can melt if next to a campfire[http://www.bay12forums.com/smf/index.php?topic=146181.msg5848684#msg5848684].

Items that fall onto a campfire will be destroyed regardless of their [[fire-safe]] or [[magma-safe]] properties, the only exceptions being [[soil]], [[powder]]s and [[liquid]]s. This includes items dropped while standing on the campfire, and [[artifact]]s. (Water appears to only put out a campfire if it flows onto it.)

== Uses ==
* Heating objects
* Melting snow or ice in containers to water by pressing {{Adv menu icon|I}}, needs [[Settings#Feature_toggles|temperature enabled]] in the [[settings]] to work.
* Creating barriers
* Destroying items

== Fortress Mode ==
It is possible to find campfires when embarking, along with other structures that cannot be built, like walls made out of cloth or leather. In these locations, there will be no trees or plants at the start, and all murky pools will have been removed. These campfires constantly produce smoke, and do not go out on their own, nor can they be removed by building over them or channeling out the ground beneath them, effectively making them irremovable.

In previous versions, [[human]] and [[necromancer]] sieges would light campfires. This was turned off in the early 0.40 series.
