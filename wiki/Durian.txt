'''Durian''' is one of the many genera of [[tree]]s found above ground. Like the vast majority of above ground trees, durian [[wood]] is brown and produces brown products. 

Durian trees drop durian [[fruit]] that's sometimes in [[Elf|elven]] [[caravan]]s. It can be cooked, brewed into [[alcohol|durian wine]], or eaten raw.

Some [[Dwarf|dwarves]] [[Preferences|like]] durian trees for their ''fragrant fruit''.

==In real life==
*Durian fruit is renowned for its smell, usually considered revolting. Oddly, it is considered to have a very pleasant taste despite the incredibly nasty odor.
