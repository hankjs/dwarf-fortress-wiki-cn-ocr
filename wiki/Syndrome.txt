[[File:syndrome_statuses_anim.gif|right]]In ''Dwarf Fortress'', a '''syndrome''' can be thought of as a condition which applies a collection of [[Syndrome#Creature Effect Tokens|effects]] to [[creature]]s who contract it. Syndromes give rise to several of the game's [[fun|more interesting]] [[Health care|medical]] [[Status_icon|predicaments]], such as [[alcohol]] inebriation, venomous snake bites, and the brain-rotting secretions of certain [[Forgotten beast|uninvited guests]]. That said, the syndrome system isn't functionally restricted to the simulation of disease  -  many of the game's supernatural features, such as [[werewolf|werewolves]], [[vampire]]s, [[necromancer]]s, [[mummy|mummy curses]] and the [[undead]], are in fact produced by applying various [[Syndrome#Special_Effects|special effects]] to creatures via syndromes.

Graphically, [[Dwarf|dwarves]], [[human]]s, [[elf|elves]], [[goblin]]s and [[kobold]]s with supernatural syndromes will have a different skin color, as seen in the image to the lower right. Other creatures will appear exactly as they are with no alterations, unless they're undead, in which they will appear with an indigo/blue tint, black eyes and white pupils, as every creature will have a unique undead sprite (including that of children and babies for some creatures).

==List of syndromes==
In unmodded games, syndromes are generally named after the animal, substance or effect that delivers them. They can cause unpleasant and sometimes fatal [[symptom]]s over a short to long duration, but some will clear up over time or with the assistance of a [[doctor]]. A [[Health care|hospital]] is required to diagnose and potentially treat those that can be helped by treatment. Note that in a world with [[dragon]]s and [[giant elephant]]s, dwarves (and elves and humans) fall into the "small creatures" category for purposes of this discussion.

: 1. For small creatures such as humans and dwarves, paralysis tends to result in suffocation.
: 2. Necrosis of the brain will eventually result in death once the brain rots away completely. 
: 3. Evil rain typically only causes minor symptoms such as blisters, bruising, coughing blood, dizziness, fever, nausea, oozing, and pain. 
: 4. Evil clouds either cause major symptoms (as with beast/titan/demon sicknesses) or permanently transform creatures into [[Undead|zombie-like]] forms. 
: 5. [[Titan]]s, [[forgotten beast]]s, [[nightmare]]s, [[experiment]]s, [[demon]]s and [[angel]]s have a chance to have a randomized syndrome. These range from mildly hazardous (mild [[Symptom#Blisters|blisters]] from inhaling boiling blood) to instantly fatal (severe necrosis from a contact poison attached to a breath weapon/creature made of blood).

==The anatomy of a syndrome==
To recap, syndromes are "diseases" which inflict effects upon creatures who acquire them. Mechanically, they're composed of a bunch of different syndrome tokens which detail [[Syndrome#Basic syndrome tokens|how it works]] and [[Syndrome#Creature effect tokens|what it does]]. Syndrome acquisition can be boiled down into two main routes: (1) via materials and (2) via interactions. Unlike most objects in the game, syndromes aren't defined in their own raw file; they're instead built up within the raw definition of the material or interaction effect to which they are tied, as described below.
{{Modding}}
'''1) Transmission via Materials'''
Any material (be it [[Material_token#INORGANIC|inorganic]], [[Material_token#CREATURE_MAT|creature-derived]], or [[Material_token#PLANT_MAT|plant-derived]]) can have one or more syndromes added to it, simply by defining the syndrome within the material's own raw definition. The addition of certain tokens (detailed [[Syndrome#SYN_CONTACT|below]]) to the syndrome will determine what must be done to the material so as to transmit the syndrome to a creature; the current modes of transmission are as follows: [[Syndrome#SYN_CONTACT|bodily contact]] with the material, [[Syndrome#SYN_INGESTED|ingestion]] or [[Syndrome#SYN_INHALED|inhalation]] of the material, or [[Syndrome#SYN_INJECTED|injection]] of the material into the bloodstream. Any combination of transmission modes can be specified per syndrome.


Here's the material definition of [[giant cave spider]] venom with its associated syndrome as an example:

''(See [[Giant cave spider/raw|here]] for the complete creature raw.)''
    [USE_MATERIAL_TEMPLATE:POISON:CREATURE_EXTRACT_TEMPLATE]
        [STATE_NAME:ALL_SOLID:frozen giant cave spider venom]
        [STATE_ADJ:ALL_SOLID:frozen giant cave spider venom]
        [STATE_NAME:LIQUID:giant cave spider venom]
        [STATE_ADJ:LIQUID:giant cave spider venom]
        [STATE_NAME:GAS:boiling giant cave spider venom]
        [STATE_ADJ:GAS:boiling giant cave spider venom]
        [PREFIX:NONE]
        [ENTERS_BLOOD]
        '''[SYNDROME]'''
            '''[SYN_NAME:giant cave spider bite]'''
            '''[SYN_AFFECTED_CLASS:GENERAL_POISON]'''
            '''[SYN_IMMUNE_CREATURE:SPIDER_CAVE_GIANT:ALL]'''
            '''[SYN_INJECTED]'''
            '''[CE_PARALYSIS:SEV:100:PROB:100:RESISTABLE:SIZE_DILUTES:START:5:PEAK:10:END:20]'''

In the above, the non-bolded section consists of various [[material definition token]]s used to define and customise the venom material. (USE_MATERIAL_TEMPLATE defines a material called 'POISON', and creates it using the template 'CREATURE_EXTRACT_TEMPLATE' as a basis, which is then altered by the other tokens placed below it. See [[Material_definition_token#STATE_NAME|STATE_NAME]], [[Material_definition_token#STATE_ADJ|STATE_ADJ]], and [[Material_definition_token#PREFIX|PREFIX]] for more information about these tokens). The relevance of [[Material_definition_token#ENTERS_BLOOD|ENTERS_BLOOD]] in this context is explained below.

The bolded section consists of the syndrome definition, which is initiated using the [[Syndrome#SYNDROME|[SYNDROME]]] token. The tokens placed after this (which are described in further detail [[Syndrome#Basic syndrome tokens|below]]) flesh out the syndrome - in this case they name it "giant cave spider bite", make it work only against creatures belonging to the 'GENERAL_POISON' [[Creature token#CREATURE_CLASS|creature class]], render giant cave spiders immune to it, and cause creatures to contract it if the venom is injected into them. The creature effect at the very bottom makes the syndrome inflict progressive complete paralysis upon the victim after a short delay, for what would be a relatively short-lived period were it not for the fact that most small creatures tend to suffocate before the effect wears off (that, or they get eaten by the giant cave spider that caused it).

Great, so how do we get this lethal venom into a creature's bloodstream to transmit the syndrome? Giant cave spiders are able to do this via the [[Creature token#SPECIALATTACK_INJECT_EXTRACT|SPECIALATTACK_INJECT_EXTRACT]] token appended to their bite attack as such:
    [SPECIALATTACK_INJECT_EXTRACT:LOCAL_CREATURE_MAT:POISON:LIQUID:100:100]
This makes their bites inject 100 units of the 'POISON' material in its liquid [[Material_definition_token#Material_States|state]]. Note that '[[Material_token#LOCAL_CREATURE_MAT|LOCAL_CREATURE_MAT]]:POISON' indicates that the 'POISON' material is defined amidst the same creature raws where the attack was detailed i.e. within the SPIDER_CAVE_GIANT creature definition; we could have written '[[Material_token#CREATURE_MAT|CREATURE_MAT]]:SPIDER_CAVE_GIANT:POISON' instead for the same result. Also note that we can make the attack inject any material we want it to, not just creature-associated materials. (Want your spider to inject molten [[gold]] into its victims to melt them from the inside out instead of bothering with syndromes? Simply replace 'LOCAL_CREATURE_MAT:POISON:LIQUID' with '[[Material_token#INORGANIC|INORGANIC]]:GOLD:LIQUID' and you're good to go).

Note that [ENTERS_BLOOD] must be added to the material definition for injection attacks making use of this material to function properly. Without this token, the material would simply [[contaminant|splatter]] over the attacked bodypart instead of entering the bloodstream, so the above syndrome, which relies solely on the [[Syndrome#SYN_INJECTED|injectable]] transmission route, wouldn't be contracted. [ENTERS_BLOOD] can of course be left out intentionally, if the aim is to cover creatures with a material that transmits syndromes [[Syndrome#SYN_CONTACT|on contact]]. Keep in mind that splattering in lieu of injection also occurs with blunt attacks, on attacked body parts devoid of [[Tissue_definition_token#VASCULAR|VASCULAR]] tissue, and on [[Creature token#BLOOD|bloodless]] victims (including creatures who've had their blood removed via [[Syndrome#CE_REMOVE_TAG|CE_REMOVE_TAG:HAS_BLOOD]]).

A fun variation on typical creature venoms is to add a [[Syndrome#SYN_CONTACT|contact-transmissible]] syndrome to the creature's [[Creature token#BLOOD|blood]] material - this tends to end poorly for any predator that chooses to attack them.


'''2) Transmission via Interactions'''

The [[Interaction token|interaction]] system can be used to add syndromes to creatures directly via certain interaction effects, most notably [[Interaction token#I_EFFECT|I_EFFECT:ADD_SYNDROME]]. After placing this I_EFFECT in an interaction definition, the syndrome to be added is defined beneath it in exactly the same manner as that used for the material-bound syndromes described above. (Note that any [[Interaction_token#IE_TARGET|IE_ tokens]] used with this I_EFFECT can be placed before or after the syndrome definition; the order doesn’t really matter). The [[Interaction token#I_EFFECT| ANIMATE]] and [[Interaction token#I_EFFECT| RESURRECT]] interaction effects also allow syndromes to be tied to them in the same manner; in this case the syndrome is applied to the target creature after it is animated or resurrected respectively.

See [[Syndrome#Spreading_diseases|below]] for an example of a syndrome-transmitting interaction.

==Basic syndrome tokens==

{| {{prettytable}}|- bgcolor="Bisque"
! Token
! Arguments
! Description
|-| {{text anchor|SYNDROME}}| | Used to begin defining a new syndrome.
|-| {{text anchor|SYN_NAME}}| <your text>| Used to specify the name of the syndrome as it appears in-game. Names don't have to be unique; it's perfectly acceptable to have multiple syndromes with identical names.

For example, this name is displayed when <nowiki>[</nowiki>[[Syndrome#CE_FEEL_EMOTION|CE_FEEL_EMOTION:<...>]]] causes an emotional reaction {{dftext|Urist is |0:1}}{{dftext|<emotion>|6:0}}{{dftext| due to <your_syn_name>.|0:1}}
|-| {{text anchor|SYN_CLASS}}| <your text>| Can be included to create a syndrome class and assign the syndrome to it, for use with the [[Interaction token#IT_CANNOT_HAVE_SYNDROME_CLASS|IT_CANNOT_HAVE_SYNDROME_CLASS]] interaction token. Can be specified more than once to assign the syndrome to multiple classes. Other syndromes can also be assigned to the same class.
|-| {{text anchor|SYN_CONTACT}}| | If the syndrome is tied to a material, creatures who come into contact with this material will contract the syndrome if this token is included in the syndrome definition. Contact transmission occurs when a creature's body becomes [[contaminant|contaminated]] with the material (visible as [material name] 'smear', 'dusting' or 'covering' over body parts when viewing the creature's inventory). Note that contact with [[item]]s made of a syndrome-inducing material currently doesn't result in transmission.

Methods of getting a material contaminant onto a creature's body include: 
* [[Creature token#SECRETION|secretions]]
* [[Interaction_token#LIQUID_GLOB|liquid projectiles]] (contaminate struck body parts if exposed)
* [[Interaction_token#TRAILING_VAPOR_FLOW|vapor]] and [[Interaction_token#TRAILING_DUST_FLOW|dust clouds]] (contaminate all external body parts, even if covered)
* [[Interaction_token#SPATTER_LIQUID|puddles]] and [[Interaction_token#SPATTER_POWDER|dust piles]] ([[Body_token#STANCE|STANCE]] body parts become contaminated if the creature walks into them [[clothing|barefoot]], and all uncovered external body parts are contaminated if the creature is [[Status icon#Non-flashing|prone]])
* [[Interaction_token#WEATHER_FALLING_MATERIAL|freakish rain]] (contaminates all external body parts, even if covered, if the creature is outside)
* unprotected bodily contact with a contaminated creature (including performing or receiving body part attacks such as punches and [[wrestling]] moves, creature collisions, as well as [[Interaction_token#I_EFFECT|CONTACT]] interaction effects, if the involved body parts are exposed)
* items [[Material_definition_token#MELTING_POINT|melting]] whilst equipped or hauled (this contaminates the body part that was holding them if exposed)
* striking the creature's body with a contaminated item (see below)

It is possible to use this token for syndromes intended to be applied via envenomed weapons (but also check out [[Syndrome#SYN_INJECTED|SYN_INJECTED]]). When a creature's body is struck with an item which is contaminated with a contact syndrome-inducing material, the syndrome will be transmitted to the struck creature, even if the attack doesn't pierce the flesh. Syndrome transmission in this context often occurs in the absence of a visible contaminant on the body.

Contact transmission only appears to occur at the moment of contamination (which is to say, when a new bodily spatter is created). If the syndrome ends (once all its [[Syndrome#Creature_effect_tokens|creature effects]] reach their END point, at which point it will be removed from the creature), it will NOT be reapplied by the original syndrome-inducing contaminant (assuming it hasn't been cleaned off yet); the creature will need to be recontaminated with the causative material for this to occur. (Note that in the case of [[Creature token#SECRETION|secretions]], the secreted contaminants are continuously reapplied to the secretory body parts, so any associated short-lasting contact syndromes allowed to target the secreting creature can potentially be reapplied at the rate of secretion; this may work differently in [[adventurer mode]]).
|-| {{text anchor|SYN_INGESTED}}| | If the syndrome is tied to a material, creatures who [[food|eat]] or drink substances comprising, containing or [[contaminant|contaminated]] with this material will contract the syndrome if this token is included. This includes [[kitchen|prepared meals]] when any of the constituent ingredients contains the material in question.

This also applies to [[creature token#GRAZER|grazing]] creatures which happen to munch on a [[plant token#GRASS|grass]] that has an ingestion-triggered syndrome tied to any of its constituent materials.
|-| {{text anchor|SYN_INHALED}}| | If the syndrome is tied to a material, creatures who inhale the material will contract the syndrome if this token is included. Materials can only be inhaled in their [[Material_definition_token#BOILING_POINT|gaseous]] state, which is attainable by [[temperature|boiling]], or in the form of a [[Interaction_token#TRAILING_GAS_FLOW|TRAILING_GAS_FLOW]], [[Interaction_token#UNDIRECTED_GAS|UNDIRECTED_GAS]] or [[Interaction_token#WEATHER_CREEPING_GAS|WEATHER_CREEPING_GAS]]. Creatures can also be made to [[Tissue_definition_token#TISSUE_LEAKS|leak]] [[Tissue_definition_token#TISSUE_MAT_STATE|gaseous tissue]] when damaged.

Note that {{token|AQUATIC|c}} creatures never inhale gaseous materials, and creatures which do breathe air aren't guaranteed to inhale gases when exposed to them for a short time. Contrary to what one might expect, creatures with {{token|NOBREATHE|c}} are in fact capable of contracting inhalation syndromes; this is presumably a bug.
|-| {{text anchor|SYN_INJECTED}}| | If the syndrome is tied to a material, the injection of this material into a creature's bloodstream will cause it to contract the syndrome if this token is included. Injection can be carried out as part of a creature attack via [[Creature_token#SPECIALATTACK_INJECT_EXTRACT|SPECIALATTACK_INJECT_EXTRACT]], or by piercing the flesh of a creature with an [[item]] that has been [[contaminant|contaminated]] with the material. Thus, this token can be used as a more specific alternative to [[Syndrome#SYN_CONTACT|SYN_CONTACT]] for syndromes intended to be administered by envenomed weapons. 

For injection to work, the material definition must include [[Material_definition_token#ENTERS_BLOOD|ENTERS_BLOOD]], the attacked body part needs to have [[Tissue_definition_token#VASCULAR|VASCULAR]] tissue, and the intended victim must have [[Creature token#BLOOD|BLOOD]] (so it won't work on creatures with the [[Syndrome#CE_REMOVE_TAG|CE_REMOVE_TAG:HAS_BLOOD]] syndrome effect). Getting the weapon "lodged into the wound" isn't a requirement.
|-| {{text anchor|SYN_AFFECTED_CLASS}}| <[[Creature token#CREATURE_CLASS|creature class]]>| If this is included, only creatures which belong to the specified [[Creature token#CREATURE_CLASS|creature class]] (as well as creatures which pass the [[Syndrome#SYN_AFFECTED_CREATURE|SYN_AFFECTED_CREATURE]] check if this is included) will be able to contract the syndrome. This token can be specified multiple times per syndrome, in which case creatures which have at least one matching class will be considered susceptible. If [[Syndrome#SYN_IMMUNE_CLASS|SYN_IMMUNE_CLASS]] and/or [[Syndrome#SYN_IMMUNE_CREATURE|SYN_IMMUNE_CREATURE]] are included, creatures which fail these checks will be unable to contract the syndrome even if they pass this class check.
|-| {{text anchor|SYN_IMMUNE_CLASS}}| <[[Creature token#CREATURE_CLASS|creature class]]>| If this is included, creatures which belong to the specified [[Creature token#CREATURE_CLASS|creature class]] will be unable to contract the syndrome. This token can be specified multiple times per syndrome, in which case creatures with at least one matching class will be considered immune (unless overridden by [[Syndrome#SYN_AFFECTED_CREATURE|SYN_AFFECTED_CREATURE]]).
|-| {{text anchor|SYN_AFFECTED_CREATURE}}| <creature>:<[[Creature_token#CASTE|caste]]>| If this is included, only the specified creature (and, if [[Syndrome#SYN_AFFECTED_CLASS|SYN_AFFECTED_CLASS]] is included, also creatures which pass this check as explained above) will be able to contract the syndrome. This token can be used multiple times per syndrome. If used alongside [[Syndrome#SYN_IMMUNE_CLASS|SYN_IMMUNE_CLASS]], the specified creature will be able to contract the syndrome regardless of this class check.

DWARF:FEMALE is an example of a valid <creature>:<caste> combination; "ALL" can be used in place of a specific caste so as to indicate that this applies to all castes of the specified creature.
|-| {{text anchor|SYN_IMMUNE_CREATURE}}| <creature>:<[[Creature_token#CASTE|caste]]>| If this is included, the specified creature will be unable to contract the syndrome (even if it matches [[Syndrome#SYN_AFFECTED_CLASS|SYN_AFFECTED_CLASS]]). It can be specified multiple times per syndrome. As above, "ALL" can be used in place of a specific caste.
|-| {{text anchor|SYN_NO_HOSPITAL}}| | Prevents creatures from being admitted to [[health care|hospital]] for problems arising directly as a result of the syndrome's effects, no matter how bad they get.
|-| {{text anchor|SYN_IDENTIFIER}}| <your text>| This token can be included to give a syndrome an identifier which can be shared between multiple syndromes. Only one identifier may be specified per syndrome.

Syndrome identifiers can be used in conjunction with the [[Creature token#SYNDROME_DILUTION_FACTOR|SYNDROME_DILUTION_FACTOR]] creature token to alter a creature’s innate resistance to the relevant [[Syndrome#Symptomatic effects|effects]] of any syndromes that possess the specified identifier. For example, every [[alcohol|alcoholic beverage]] in unmodded games comes with its own copy of an intoxicating syndrome, each of which has a <code>[SYN_IDENTIFIER:INEBRIATION]</code> token. All [[dwarf|dwarves]] have <code>[SYNDROME_DILUTION_FACTOR:INEBRIATION:150]</code>, which decreases the severity of any effects derived from a syndrome with the INEBRIATION identifier, thus enabling them to better handle all forms of alcohol.

When a creature gets a new syndrome with the same SYN_IDENTIFIER, it merges the effects of the new syndrome into the old one, resetting any overlapping syndrome effects to their PEAK time. If the new one comes with a [[Syndrome#SYN_CONCENTRATION_ADDED|SYN_CONCENTRATION_ADDED]] token, it will additionally adjust the first syndrome's concentration on any overlapping syndrome effects as described below. Taking the above example once again, a sober dwarf drinking their first alcoholic beverage would be exposed to an INEBRIATION syndrome, contracting it and having its effects manifest normally. If the dwarf were to have another drink before the effects of this first syndrome have all worn off (by reaching their [[Syndrome#Creature effect tokens|END]] point), then exposure to the second INEBRIATION syndrome would increase the severity of the original syndrome's effects, making the dwarf progressively more intoxicated, and reset the timer on inebriation to its PEAK.
|-| {{text anchor|SYN_CONCENTRATION_ADDED}}| <amount>:<max>| Syndrome concentration is essentially a quantity which impacts the severity of the syndrome's relevant [[Syndrome#Symptomatic effects|effects]]. The higher the syndrome's concentration, the greater its severity. When a syndrome is contracted, the value specified in <amount> is its initial concentration level.

As described above, if a creature is exposed to a syndrome with a particular [[Syndrome#SYN_IDENTIFIER|SYN_IDENTIFIER]] when already possessing an active syndrome with the same identifier, then this later syndrome isn't contracted, instead contributing to the original syndrome's concentration as indicated by its SYN_CONCENTRATION_ADDED token, if present. The syndrome in question will increase the original syndrome's concentration by <amount> whenever the creature is exposed to it, until its specified <max> concentration is reached by the original syndrome, causing subsequent exposure to this particular syndrome to do nothing (that is, until the original syndrome ends, at which point a new one may be contracted normally). Should the creature be exposed to a different syndrome with the same identifier and a higher <max> value, the concentration will of course increase further.

For example, all forms of [[alcohol]] in the vanilla game have a syndrome with <code>[SYN_IDENTIFIER:INEBRIATION]</code> and <code>[SYN_CONCENTRATION_ADDED:100:1000]</code>. When alcohol is first drunk, the creature contracts the relevant inebriating syndrome at a concentration level of 100. Every subsequent drink will increase the concentration of this first syndrome by a further 100, intensifying its effects, until it plateaus at concentration level 1000. Once all the effects of the original syndrome have ended, the cycle can be started anew (assuming the drinker hasn't died of [[Alcohol#Alcohol_poisoning|alcohol poisoning]] yet). As described by Toady, "Each 100 of <amount> will contribute SEV in general to each effect (before [[Creature token#SYNDROME_DILUTION_FACTOR|dilution]]), <max> goes up to 1000. The concentration does not decrease, but will stay at the maximum attained until the syndrome wears off."

Some of the generated interaction-derived syndromes come with <code>[SYN_CONCENTRATION_ADDED:1000:0]</code>. According to Toady, this "was a precaution after I had one bug with effects not fully manifesting due to low levels. It may not be necessary, but I decided to give everybody a full dose of the juice until I could get a closer look at it."

==Creature Effect Tokens==
Each and every syndrome has a number of creature effect tokens, represented by CE_X - these lovely little beauties determine exactly how the poor creature suffering from the syndrome is affected.  An example CE token is as follows:

  [CE_NECROSIS:SEV:100:PROB:100:LOCALIZED:VASCULAR_ONLY:RESISTABLE:START:50:PEAK:1000:END:2000]

In this example, we have an effect that will always cause severe necrosis in whichever bodypart it touches, so long as that bodypart is vascular and that the creature is not able to resist it in some manner.  The effect begins shortly after the syndrome is contracted, peaks 1000 [[time|time units]] afterwards, and finally ceases another 1000 time units later.

As a general rule of thumb, so long as CE_X starts the string and START/(PEAK/END) ends it, the order of the intervening tokens isn't important.

{| {{prettytable}}|- bgcolor="Bisque"
! Token
! Arguments
! Description
|-| {{text anchor|CE_X}}| | The effect type.  This can be a number of different tokens, as detailed in the tables that follow this one.
|-| {{text anchor|SEV}}| <amount>| The severity of the effect.  Higher values appear to be worse, with SEV:1000 CE_NECROSIS causing a part to near-instantly become rotten. Can go as high as 2147483647, and can be negative.
|-| {{text anchor|PROB}}| <amount>| The probability of the effect actually manifesting in the victim, as a percentage.  100 means always, 1 means a 1 in 100 chance.
|-| {{text anchor|BP}}| <body part>:<tissue>| (Optional; overridden by [[Syndrome#LOCALIZED|LOCALIZED]]) Specifies which body parts and tissues the effect is to be applied to. Not every effect requires a target!

<body part> can be BY_CATEGORY:X to target body parts with a matching [CATEGORY:X] [[body token]] (or ALL to affect everything), BY_TYPE:X to target body parts having a particular type (UPPERBODY, LOWERBODY, HEAD, GRASP, or STANCE), or BY_TOKEN:X to target individual body parts by their ID as specified by the [BP] token of the body plan definition. For example, if you wanted to target the lungs of a creature, you would use BP:BY_CATEGORY:LUNG:ALL.  The effect would act on all body parts within the creature with the CATEGORY tag LUNG and affect all tissue layers.  For another example, say you wanted to cause the skin to rot off a creature - you could use BP:BY_CATEGORY:ALL:SKIN, targeting the SKIN tissue on all body parts. Multiple targets can be given in one effect by placing the BP tokens end to end. This is one of the most powerful and useful aspects of the syndrome system, as it allows you to selectively target body parts relevant to the contagion, like lungs for coal dust inhalation, or the eyes for exposure to an acid gas.
|-| {{text anchor|LOCALIZED}}| | (Optional; overrides [[Syndrome#BP|BP]] tokens) This tag causes an effect to ignore all BP tokens and then forces the game to attempt to apply the effect to the limb that came into contact with the contagion - i.e. the part that was bitten by the creature injecting the syndrome material, or the one that was splattered by a contact contagion. If an effect can not be applied to the contacted limb (such as IMPAIR_FUNCTION on a non-organ) then this token makes the effect do nothing. This token also makes inhaled syndromes have no effect.
|-| {{text anchor|VASCULAR_ONLY}}| | (Optional) This effect only affects tissue layers with the VASCULAR token.
|-| {{text anchor|MUSCULAR_ONLY}}| | (Optional) This effect only affects tissue layers with the MUSCULAR token.
|-| {{text anchor|SIZE_DILUTES}}| | (Optional) This token presumably causes the severity of the effect to scale with the size of the creature compared to the size of the dose of contagion they received, but has yet to be extensively tested.
|-| {{text anchor|SIZE_DELAYS}}| | (Optional) As above, this token has yet to be tested but presumably delays the onset of an effect according to the size of the victim.
|-| {{text anchor|CAN_BE_HIDDEN}}| | (Optional) Can be hidden by a unit assuming a secret identity, such as a [[vampire]]. {{verify}}
|-| {{text anchor|RESISTABLE}} (sic)| | (Optional) Whether a syndrome can build tolerance by exposure. If this token is present, each application of the syndrome will cause future applications to be weaker. This seems to be a permanent effect that does not fall off over time. (yes, it's spelled incorrectly)
|-| {{text anchor|DWF_STRETCH}}| <amount>| (Optional) Multiplies the duration values of the effect by the specified amount in Fortress mode.
|-| {{text anchor|ABRUPT_START}}| | (Optional) Makes the effect begin immediately rather than ramping up.
|-| {{text anchor|ABRUPT_END}}| | (Optional) Makes the effect end immediately rather than ramping down.
|-| {{text anchor|ABRUPT}}| | (Optional) Combination of ABRUPT_START and ABRUPT_END.
|-| {{text anchor|START}}| <time>| Determines the time after exposure, in ticks, when the effect starts. Required for all effects.
|-| {{text anchor|PEAK}}| <time>| (Optional) Determines the time after exposure, in ticks, when the effect reaches its peak intensity.
|-| {{text anchor|END}}| <time>| (Optional) Determines the time after exposure, in ticks, when the effect ends.|}

A key point that needs to be understood with regards to damaging syndrome effects such as [[Syndrome#CE_BRUISING|bruising]] is that they deal a quantity of damage (based on the effect's SEV and other modifiers) '''every [[time|tick]]''', and this damage accumulates over time. Thus, even a bruising effect at the lowest possible severity value '''will''' eventually lead to destruction of the affected body part(s) if the effect has a long enough duration. Similarly, [[Syndrome#Healing_Effects|healing effects]] undo a specific amount of damage every tick whilst the effect lasts.


===Symptomatic Effects===

The following table contains [[Syndrome#Creature effect tokens|creature effect tokens]] which cause purely medical [[symptom]]s.

Non-targeted effects will ignore any BP tokens and LOCALIZED tokens.

The details of this table are still being thrashed out by modders, so if you have anything to add, please don't hesitate to hit the edit button!

{| {{prettytable}}|- bgcolor="Bisque"
! Token
! Accepts Target
! Description|-| {{text anchor|CE_BRUISING}}| Yes| Causes the targeted body part to undergo bruising.|-| {{text anchor|CE_BLISTERS}}| Yes| Covers the targeted body part with blisters.|-| {{text anchor|CE_OOZING}}| Yes| Causes pus to ooze from the afflicted body part.|-| {{text anchor|CE_BLEEDING}}| Yes| Causes the targeted body part to start bleeding, with heavy enough bleeding resulting in the death of the sufferer. Some conditions seem to cause bleeding to be fatal no matter how weak.|-| {{text anchor|CE_SWELLING}}| Yes| Causes the targeted body part to swell up. Extreme swelling may lead to necrosis.|-| {{text anchor|CE_NECROSIS}}| Yes| Causes the targeted body part to rot, with associated tissue damage, miasma emission and bleeding. The victim slowly bleeds to death if the wound is not treated. Badly necrotic limbs will require amputation.|-| {{text anchor|CE_NUMBNESS}}| Optional| Causes numbness in the affected body part, blocking pain. Extreme numbness may lead to sensory nerve damage.  If no target is specified this applies to all body parts.|-| {{text anchor|CE_PAIN}}| Optional| Afflicts the targeted body part with intense pain.  If no target is specified this applies to all body parts.|-| {{text anchor|CE_PARALYSIS}}| Optional| Causes complete paralysis of the affected body part. Paralysis on a limb may lead to motor nerve damage. If no target is specified this causes total paralysis, which can lead to suffocation of smaller creatures.|-| {{text anchor|CE_IMPAIR_FUNCTION}}| Yes| An organ afflicted with this effect is rendered inoperable - for example, if both lungs are impaired the creature can't breathe and will suffocate.  This token only affects organs, not limbs. Note that this effect is currently bugged, and will not "turn off" until the creature receives a wound to cause its body parts to update.|-| {{text anchor|CE_DIZZINESS}}| No| Inflicts the Dizziness condition, occasional fainting and a general slowdown in movement and work speed.|-| {{text anchor|CE_DROWSINESS}}| No| Causes the Drowsiness condition.|-| {{text anchor|CE_UNCONSCIOUSNESS}}| No| Renders the creature unconscious.|-| {{text anchor|CE_FEVER}}| No| Causes the Fever condition.|-| {{text anchor|CE_NAUSEA}}| No| Causes the Nausea condition, and heavy vomiting. Can eventually lead to dehydration and death.|-| {{text anchor|CE_COUGH_BLOOD}}| No| This effect results in the sufferer periodically coughing blood, which stains the tile they're on and requires cleanup.  It doesn't appear to be lethal, but may cause minor bleeding damage.|-| {{text anchor|CE_VOMIT_BLOOD}}| No| This effect results in the sufferer periodically vomiting blood, which stains the tile they're on and requires cleanup.  It doesn't appear to be lethal, but may cause minor bleeding damage.|}

===Healing Effects===
Most of the [[Syndrome#Symptomatic_Effects|above]] effects have counterparts to alleviate [[symptom]]s and heal physical damage:
{| {{prettytable}}|- bgcolor="Bisque"
! Token
! Accepts Target
! Description|-| {{text anchor|CE_REDUCE_PAIN}}| Yes| Decreases the severity of pain produced by wounds or syndrome effects on the targeted body part. The SEV value probably controls by how much the pain is decreased.|-| {{text anchor|CE_REDUCE_SWELLING}}| Yes| Decreases the severity of swelling on the targeted body part.|-| {{text anchor|CE_REDUCE_PARALYSIS}}| Yes| Decreases the severity of any paralysis effects on the targeted body part.|-| {{text anchor|CE_REDUCE_DIZZINESS}}| No| Decreases the severity of any dizziness the creature has.|-| {{text anchor|CE_REDUCE_NAUSEA}}| No| Decreases the severity of any nausea the creature has.|-| {{text anchor|CE_REDUCE_FEVER}}| No| Decreases the severity of any fever the creature has.|-| {{text anchor|CE_STOP_BLEEDING}}| Yes| Decreases the severity of the bleeding of any wounds or syndrome effects on the targeted body part. The SEV value probably controls by how much the bleeding is decreased.|-| {{text anchor|CE_CLOSE_OPEN_WOUNDS}}| Yes| Closes any wounds on the targeted body part with speed depending on the SEV value.|-| {{text anchor|CE_CURE_INFECTION}}| Yes?| Probably decreases the severity of the infection from infected wounds over time.|-| {{text anchor|CE_HEAL_TISSUES}}| Yes| Heals the tissues of the targeted body part with speed depending on the SEV value.|-| {{text anchor|CE_HEAL_NERVES}}| Yes| Heals the nerves of the targeted body part with speed depending on the SEV value.|-| {{text anchor|CE_REGROW_PARTS}}| Yes| Causes missing body parts to regrow. SEV controls how quickly body parts are regrown. In adventure, parts may be lost again once you travel or wait/sleep {{bug|0011396}}.|}

===Special Effects===
Several special syndrome effects take different arguments than the above. These are used for generated interactions in unmodded games, but may be used as well for any custom substance or interaction. CE_FEEL_EMOTION is the only one of these that takes SEV.

Halts the creature's aging process and prevents [[Creature token#MAXAGE|death by old age]].

*STERILE
Makes the creature unable to produce [[children|offspring]].

*HAS_BLOOD
*MORTAL

Adding tags will cause the creature to pass/fail any relevant <code>[[Interaction token#IT_REQUIRES|IT_REQUIRES]]</code>/<code>[[Interaction_token#IT_FORBIDDEN|IT_FORBIDDEN]]</code> checks (with the apparent exceptions of FIT_FOR_ANIMATION and FIT_FOR_RESURRECTION). Note that [[Syndrome#CE_REMOVE_TAG|CE_REMOVE_TAG]] overrides this effect.
|-| {{text anchor|CE_REMOVE_TAG}}| No| <tag 1>:<tag 2>:etc| Removes the specified tag(s) from the affected creature. Multiple tags can be specified sequentially within a single effect token. The tags listed [[Syndrome#CE_ADD_TAG|above]] can all be removed via this effect.

If a particular tag is targeted by both CE_REMOVE_TAG and [[Syndrome#CE_ADD_TAG|CE_ADD_TAG]], and both effects are active simultaneously, CE_REMOVE_TAG takes precedence (i.e. the overall effect is that of tag removal for as long as CE_REMOVE_TAG remains active). The order in which the effects activate doesn't affect this, not even if CE_ADD_TAG is added later/earlier via a different syndrome.

Removing tags will cause the creature to fail/pass any relevant <code>[[Interaction token#IT_REQUIRES|IT_REQUIRES]]</code>/<code>[[Interaction_token#IT_FORBIDDEN|IT_FORBIDDEN]]</code> checks (with the apparent exceptions of FIT_FOR_ANIMATION and FIT_FOR_RESURRECTION).


'''Special tags:'''

* HAS_BLOOD
If this tag is removed, the creature behaves as though it has no [[Creature token#BLOOD|blood]]; it doesn't bleed when [[Tissue definition token#VASCULAR|VASCULAR]] tissues are damaged (and thus cannot die of blood loss), and substances cannot be [[Syndrome#SYN_INJECTED|injected]] into it.

* NO_AGING
* STERILE
Removing these tags doesn't appear to do anything unless they've been added to a creature via [[Syndrome#CE_ADD_TAG|CE_ADD_TAG]], in which case their effects will be negated as described above.

* MORTAL
* FIT_FOR_ANIMATION
* FIT_FOR_RESURRECTION
Removing these tags doesn't appear to do anything.
|- a| {{text anchor|CE_DISPLAY_NAME}}| No| NAME:singular:plural:adjective| Attaches the specified name to the creature's normal name.
|-| {{text anchor|CE_DISPLAY_TILE}}| No| TILE:[[Tilesets|<tile value or character>]]:[[Color#Color_values|<foreground color>:<background color>:<foreground brightness>]]| Causes the creature to display the specified tile instead of its normal one.
|-| {{text anchor|CE_FLASH_TILE}}| No| TILE:[[Tilesets|<tile value or character>]]:[[Color#Color_values|<foreground color>:<background color>:<foreground brightness>]]:FREQUENCY:<frames default tile>:<frames syndrome tile>| Causes the creature to flash between its normal tile and the one specified here.

|-| {{text anchor|CE_MENT_ATT_CHANGE}}| No| [[Attribute]]:percentage:fixed boost(?)| Alters the creature's specified [[Attribute#Soul_attributes|mental attribute]].
|-| {{text anchor|CE_SPEED_CHANGE}}| No| speed modifier:number| Changes the creature's speed.
Speed modifier contains one or both of:
* SPEED_PERC:percentage (this modifies a creature's in-game speed, so higher numbers are faster)
* SPEED_ADD:number (this modifies a creature's [SPEED:XX] token, so higher numbers are slower. Negative numbers are accepted though will only reduce a creature's speed to zero)
The minimum and maximum speeds able to be created by CE_SPEED_CHANGE are 99 and 10,000 respectively.
|-| {{text anchor|CE_SKILL_ROLL_ADJUST}}| No| PERC:percentage:PERC_ON:percentage| Alters the results of all [[Skill#Skills in use|skill rolls]] the creature makes, multiplying them by ``PERC / 100``. The ``PERC_ON`` value specifies the probability of the effect being applied on a particular roll.
e.g. This causes a 20% chance of any skill roll being 0 (multiplies the current skill level by 0/100) instead of the normal result
 [CE_SKILL_ROLL_ADJUST:PROB:100:PERC:0:PERC_ON:20:START:0]
|-| {{text anchor|CE_BODY_APPEARANCE_MODIFIER}}| No| APPEARANCE_MODIFIER:HEIGHT/LENGTH/BROADNESS:percentage(?) | Alters the size of the creature.
|-| {{text anchor|CE_BP_APPEARANCE_MODIFIER}}| Yes| body part:APPEARANCE_MODIFIER:attribute:number| Alters the characteristics (height, width etc.) of a body part. "body part" here can either be BP, followed by the usual BY_CATEGORY etc., or TL, followed by the usual selection for SELECT_TISSUE_LAYER.
|-| {{text anchor|CE_BODY_TRANSFORMATION}}| No|| Makes the affected unit transform into a different creature. The target creature may either be specified directly by following this with a CE:CREATURE token, or else set to be randomly selected as indicated by the additional tokens listed below (of which multiple may be specified).

Note that transformation into or out of the target form causes the creature to drop all items in its inventory and instantly heals all of its wounds.  If an [[undead]] limb happens to be transformed, its entire body will regenerate upon transforming back. 

Transformation will also re-roll a creature's age to somewhere within the new form's adult age range. This prevents a 70 year old dwarf from dying the moment it turns into a bat ([[Creature token#MAXAGE|max age]] of 3). If it remains stuck as a bat for (at most) three consecutive years it will die of old age as a bat before the syndrome is able to wear off.

A transformed creature generally retains its previous group and civilization membership (unless it becomes [[Creature token#OPPOSED_TO_LIFE|OPPOSED_TO_LIFE]] for example). A transformed dwarf will remain a member of your fortress (and may still hold or gain [[Noble|positions]]), a transformed trader will hang out at the trade depot and eventually leave along with its fellow traders, and a transformed goblin will continue sieging your fortress with its fellow siege members.

A transformed diplomat (like a trade liaison or expedition leader) will still be able to conduct diplomatic meetings even if they no longer [[Creature token#CAN_SPEAK|CAN_SPEAK]].

Transformed creatures can be trained and adopted following the usual rules. However note that if a transformed creature is a member of your fortress then [[Animal Training|animal trainers]] will not attempt to train it. 

A transformed creature can produce offspring with creatures of the species it has transformed into and will follow that creature's normal rules for reproduction.

[[Butcher#Butchering|Butchering]] a transformed creature may produce an odd mix of products. For example, if Urist the dwarf is transformed into a [[Cow|bull]] and then is led to the butcher's block for slaughter the resulting products will contain some bull creature parts like "Urist's horn", "Urist's hoof", and "Urist's skin" (which becomes "cow leather" when [[Tanner|tanned]]) but will also contain some dwarf creature parts like "dwarf meat", "dwarf eye", and "dwarf brain".


'''Specific transformation:'''

* '''CE:CREATURE:'''<creature>:<caste><br>
This can be used to specify a target creature to transform into ([CE:CREATURE:DWARF:FEMALE], for example). '''ALL''' or '''ANY''' can be used in place of a specific caste to randomise this for every transformation. 
Do note that using '''ALL''' or '''ANY''' for transformation castes will make the creature transform over and over again with the interval depending on the '''START''' token. This can lead to an unending transformation loop. [[Syndrome#looping_problem|However, there is a way to get around this.]] 


'''Random transformation:'''

* '''CE:CREATURE_FLAG:'''<[[Interaction_token#Creature_and_Caste_Flags|creature flag]]><br>
Narrows down the selection to creatures which have the specified [[Interaction_token#Creature_and_Caste_Flags|creature flag]]. May be used multiple times per transformation effect; creatures which lack any of the indicated flags will never be transformed into.

* '''CE:FORBIDDEN_CREATURE_FLAG:'''<[[Interaction_token#Creature_and_Caste_Flags|creature flag]]><br>
Excludes creatures with the specified [[Interaction_token#Creature_and_Caste_Flags|creature flag]] from the random selection pool. May be used multiple times per transformation effect; creatures which possess any of the indicated flags will never be transformed into.

* '''CE:CREATURE_CASTE_FLAG:'''<[[Interaction_token#Creature_and_Caste_Flags|caste flag]]><br>
Narrows down the selection to creatures which have the specified [[Interaction_token#Creature_and_Caste_Flags|caste flag]]. May be used multiple times per transformation effect; creatures which lack any of the indicated flags will never be transformed into.

* '''CE:FORBIDDEN_CREATURE_CASTE_FLAG:'''<[[Interaction_token#Creature_and_Caste_Flags|caste flag]]><br>
Excludes any creature with the specified [[Interaction_token#Creature_and_Caste_Flags|caste flag]] from the random selection pool. May be used multiple times per transformation effect; creatures which possess any of the indicated flags will never be transformed into.

*'''CE:HAVE_FAST_EFFORTLESS_GAIT_SPEED:'''<minimum [[Gait#Speed|gait speed]]><br>
Narrows down the selection to creatures which have at least one [[gait]] with an [[Creature_token#GAIT|<energy expenditure>]] of 0 and a [[Creature_token#GAIT|<max speed>]] less than or equal to the specified <minimum gait speed> ("less than" because lower is faster in the scale used for [[Gait#Speed|gait speed]]). This is used in generated [[Die#Adventurer_Mode|divination curses]] to prevent the player from being transformed into a creature that is frustratingly slow to play as. [http://www.bay12forums.com/smf/index.php?topic=169696.msg8243222#msg8243222]

*'''CE:ALL_SLOW_EFFORTLESS_GAIT_SPEED:'''<maximum [[Gait#Speed|gait speed]]><br>
Excludes any creatures which have at least one [[gait]] with an [[Creature_token#GAIT|<energy expenditure>]] of 0 and a [[Creature_token#GAIT|<max speed>]] value less than or equal to the specified <maximum gait speed> (note that larger values are slower in the scale used for [[Gait#Speed|gait speed]]).

|-| {{text anchor|CE_MATERIAL_FORCE_MULTIPLIER}}| No| MAT_MULT:[[material token|<material token>]]:<value A>:<value B>| When the affected creature is struck with a weapon made of the specified material, the force exerted will be multiplied by A/B, thus making the creature more or less susceptible to this material. For example, if A is 2 and B is 1, the force exerted by the defined material will be doubled. If A is 1 and B is 2, it will be halved instead. '''NONE:NONE''' can be used in place of a specific material token so as to make the effect applicable to all materials. Note that this syndrome effect is equivalent to the [[Creature_token#MATERIAL_FORCE_MULTIPLIER|MATERIAL_FORCE_MULTIPLIER]] creature token.
|-| {{text anchor|CE_CAN_DO_INTERACTION}}| No| | Makes the creature able to perform an [[Interaction_token|interaction]]. Follow this effect token with [[Interaction_token#INTERACTION|[CDI:INTERACTION:<interaction name>]]] to specify the desired interaction, and add other [[Interaction_token#Usage|CDI tokens]] as required.|-| {{text anchor|CE_SPECIAL_ATTACK_INTERACTION}}| Yes| INTERACTION:<interaction name>:BP:<selection criteria>:<name of category,type, or token of designated part/parts>| Makes the creature able to perform an interaction when using an attack with a designated body part/parts. See [[#In 0.47.01|below]] for an example
|-| {{text anchor|CE_BODY_MAT_INTERACTION}}| No| MAT_TOKEN:<body material token>| This is used to tie an [[Interaction_token|interaction]] to one of the creature’s body materials. Generated [[vampire]] syndromes use this effect to make vampire blood pass on the vampirism curse when consumed.

The target body material is specified by inserting its ID as defined in the creature raws. For example, when a syndrome with “CE_BODY_MAT_INTERACTION:MAT_TOKEN:SWEAT” is gained by a unit, the effect will apply to any material defined as “SWEAT” in the creature raws of that unit, if such a material is present.
'''RESERVED_BLOOD''' is a special body material token which can be used to specify the [[Creature_token#BLOOD|[BLOOD]]] material of any creature, regardless of the material's actual ID.

The following tokens should be placed after this effect:
* '''CE:SYNDROME_TAG:'''<transmission method> is used to specify what must be done with the body material to trigger the interaction. Replace "<transmission method>" with any of '''[[Syndrome#SYN_INGESTED|SYN_INGESTED]], [[Syndrome#SYN_INJECTED|SYN_INJECTED]], [[Syndrome#SYN_CONTACT|SYN_CONTACT]], [[Syndrome#SYN_INHALED|SYN_INHALED]]'''. Multiple instances of this tag may be used to specify different valid transmission routes. ''However, SYN_INGESTED appears to be the only one that works at present.''
* '''CE:INTERACTION:'''<[[Interaction_token#INTERACTION|interaction ID]]> is used to specify which interaction is to be run (replace "<interaction ID>" with the name of the desired interaction). Appropriate interaction effects with a creature target (such as [[Interaction_token#I_EFFECT|ADD_SYNDROME]]) will be inflicted upon the unit who interacts with the body material as specified above. Note that the linked interaction must have an [[Interaction_token#I_SOURCE|[I_SOURCE:INGESTION]]] token for this to work.

This currently only works on materials obtained from historical figures. That is to say, the material must bear the source unit's name, such as "Urist McVampire's dwarf blood" as opposed to mere "dwarf blood".
|-| {{text anchor|CE_SENSE_CREATURE_CLASS}}| No| CLASS:<[[Creature_token#CREATURE_CLASS|creature class]]>:
[[Tilesets|<tile value or character>]]:
[[Color#Color_values|<foreground color>:<background color>:<foreground brightness>]]| Provides the ability to sense creatures belonging to the specified [[Creature_token#CREATURE_CLASS|creature class]] even when such creatures lie far beyond line of sight, including through walls and floors. It also appears to reduce or negate the combat penalty of [[Wound#Blindness|blind]] units when fighting creatures they can sense. In [[adventure mode]], the specified tile will be used to represent sensed creatures when they cannot be seen directly.
|-| {{text anchor|CE_FEEL_EMOTION}}| No| EMOTION:<[[emotion]]>| Makes the creature feel a specific [[emotion]]. The effect's SEV value determines how intense the emotion is. The creature also receives a [[thought]] in the following format: "[creature] feels [emotion] due to [[Syndrome#SYN_NAME|[syndrome name]]]". See [[Emotion]] for the list of valid emotions.
|-| {{text anchor|CE_CHANGE_PERSONALITY}}| No| FACET:<[[Personality facet|personality facet]]>:<amount>| Changes a [[personality facet]] by the given amount. Multiple FACET:<facet>:<amount> sets may be used, and <amount> can be negative. For example, generated [[necromancer]] syndromes come with the following effect:<br>
<code>[CE_CHANGE_PERSONALITY:FACET:ANXIETY_PROPENSITY:50:FACET:TRUST:-50:START:0:ABRUPT]</code>

According to Toady, CE_CHANGE_PERSONALITY effects can cause creatures to re-evaluate their [[Personality goal|goals]] in worldgen; the boost to anxiety and distrust given to necromancers makes it more likely for them to develop the goal of [[Personality goal#RULE_THE_WORLD|ruling the world]]. [http://www.bay12forums.com/smf/index.php?topic=169696.msg8275328#msg8275328]
|-| {{text anchor|CE_ERRATIC_BEHAVIOR}}| No|| Causes erratic behavior, meaning "People that [[Personality facet#VIOLENT|like to brawl]] have a chance of starting a brawl-level fight with any nearby adult." [http://www.bay12forums.com/smf//index.php?topic=159164.msg7632503#msg7632503 -Toady]|}

'''All''' creature effect tokens take START, END and PROB numbers, and can be followed by [CE:PERIODIC] and/or [CE:COUNTER_TRIGGER] to restrict when they actually take effect.

===Periodic Triggers===

'''[CE:{{text anchor|PERIODIC}}:<period_type>:<min_value>:<max_value>]'''

When this token is placed after a syndrome effect, it will prevent that effect from working unless within the specified period range.

For example, generated [[werebeast]] syndromes have a [[Syndrome#CE_BODY_TRANSFORMATION|body transformation effect]] with <code>[CE:PERIODIC:[[Syndrome#MOON_PHASE|MOON_PHASE]]:27:0]</code>, which makes the transformation active only throughout moon phases 27 to 0 (the full moon period). Once the moon phase changes from 0 to 1, the transformation will end and remain inactive until phase 27 is reached again (unless of course the effect has an END time which is reached before this happens. On that note, keep in mind that the START time of the effect needs to have been reached for activation to have become possible).

Only one periodic trigger may currently be specified per effect. [[Syndrome#Counter_Triggers|Counter triggers]] can also be specified for the same effect, in which case both the periodic trigger and at least one counter trigger will need to have its conditions met for the effect to be allowed to work.

MOON_PHASE is currently the only valid period type:

{| {{prettytable}}|- bgcolor="Bisque"
! Period
! Description|-| {{text anchor|MOON_PHASE}}| The lunar cycle in ''Dwarf Fortress'' is composed of 28 segments (each slightly shorter than a [[time|day]] in duration), with each segment represented by a value ranging from 0 to 27. These correspond to moon phases as follows:
* '''0''' = full moon
* '''1-4''' = waning gibbous
* '''5-8''' = waning half
* '''9-12''' = waning crescent
* '''13-14''' = new moon
* '''15-18''' = waxing crescent
* '''19-22''' = waxing half
* '''23-26''' = waxing gibbous
* '''27''' = full moon|}

===Counter Triggers===

'''[CE:{{text anchor|COUNTER_TRIGGER}}:<counter_name>:<min_value>:<max_value>:REQUIRED]'''

Creatures in ''Dwarf Fortress'' possess internal counters which keep track of their various activities and statuses. When this token is placed after a syndrome effect, it will prevent the effect from working unless the affected creature has the indicated counter, and its value lies within the specified range.

For example, generated [[vampire]] syndromes use <code>[CE:COUNTER_TRIGGER:[[Syndrome#DRINKING_BLOOD|DRINKING_BLOOD]]:1:NONE:REQUIRED]</code> with an [[Syndrome#CE_BP_APPEARANCE_MODIFIER|appearance modifier]] to make the vampire's teeth temporarily lengthen whilst leeching blood.

Note that <code>NONE</code> can be used in place of <max_value> to indicate that any value above <min_value> is valid. <code>NONE</code> can also be used in place of <min_value>, which is equivalent to the lowest value attainable by a counter.

<code>REQUIRED</code> implies that the effect won't proceed if the counter exists but doesn't lie within the range provided. However, it's actually redunant as COUNTER_TRIGGER always checks for both of these conditions [http://www.bay12forums.com/smf/index.php?topic=169696.msg8173424#msg8173424]; replacing it with <code>NONE</code> doesn't alter the way the trigger functions, though it ''will'' fail to work if this slot is left empty instead.

As detailed below, most counters only exist temporarily, so their use as triggers is somewhat more restricted than intuition suggests. For example, specifying <code>0</code> or <code>NONE</code> as the <min_value> for a [[Syndrome#CAVE_ADAPT|CAVE_ADAPT]] trigger wouldn't permit the effect to work when the affected creature is outside, since this counter is removed from the unit as soon as its value decreases past 1. Similarly, [[Syndrome#MILK_COUNTER|MILK_COUNTER]] is only present for some time ''after'' a creature is milked.

Multiple counter triggers can be specified per effect, in which case the effect will be permitted to work if at least one of the trigger conditions is met. A [[Syndrome#Periodic_Triggers|periodic trigger]] can also be specified for the same effect, in which case both the periodic trigger and at least one counter trigger will need to have their conditions met for the effect to work.

The following is a list of valid counter types including a couple of notable values:

{| {{prettytable}}|- bgcolor="Bisque"
! Counter
! Description
|-| {{text anchor|ALCOHOLIC}}| For {{token|ALCOHOL_DEPENDENT|c}} creatures, this counter increases by 1 each [[time|tick]], and is reset to 0 when the creature drinks [[alcohol]]. The following messages are added after "needs alcohol to get through the working day" in the creature's description when the counter reaches the specified values:
* 100800 (3 months) = and is starting to work slowly due to its scarcity
* 201600 (6 months) = and really wants a drink
* 302400 (9 months) = and has gone without a drink for far, far too long
* 403200 (1 year) = and can't even remember the last time (s)he had some
|-| {{text anchor|CAVE_ADAPT}}| For creatures with the {{token|CAVE_ADAPT|c}} token, this counter is created and increases by 1 each [[time|tick]] when the creature is in the {{DFtext|Dark|0:1}}, and is deleted once the dwarf steps outside and [[vomit]]s. See [[cave adaptation]] for more information.
* 403200 (1 year) = going outside causes irritation
* 604800 (1.5 years) = going outside causes nausea
|-| {{text anchor|MILK_COUNTER}}| When a creature is milked, this counter is created and set to the frequency value specified in the creature's {{token|MILKABLE|c}} token, and subsequently decreases by 1 each [[time|tick]] until it reaches 0, at which point it is immediately removed, making the creature available for milking again.
|-| {{text anchor|EGG_SPENT}}| This counter is created and set to 100800 (3 months' worth of [[time|tick]]s in fortress mode) when a creature [[Creature_token#LAYS_EGGS|lays eggs]], and thereafter decreases by 1 each tick until it reaches 0, at which point it is removed and the creature regains the ability to lay eggs.
|-| {{text anchor|GROUNDED_ANIMAL_ANGER}}| This counter is added and increases by 200 whenever a unit is lying on the ground and does not have [CAN_LEARN]. It subsequently decreases by 1 each [[time|tick]], with a 1% chance to increase by 200. The counter is removed if it decreases to 0.  If the counter is greater than 45000 the unit will lash out at a random nearby unit and the counter will be reset to 40000. This is the counter's only effect. 
|-| {{text anchor|TIME_SINCE_SUCKED_BLOOD}}| This counter rises by 1 every [[time|tick]] for creatures with the {{token|BLOODSUCKER|c}} token. When it rises high enough (generally around 100800; 3 months in fortress mode time), the creature will seek an [[sleep|unconscious]] victim to leech off of.  Blood-sucking causes the counter to decrease, and will continue until either the victim is dead or the counter reaches 0. Note that this counter isn't removed when 0 is reached.

When playing as a bloodsucker in [[adventure mode]], the following bloodthirst indicators are displayed when this counter reaches the specified values:
* 172800 (1 day in adventure mode time) = {{DFtext|Thirsty|4:0}}
* 1209600 (1 week) = {{DFtext|Thirsty!|4:1}}
* 2419200 (2 weeks) = {{DFtext|Thirsty!|5:1}}
Various penalties are applied as bloodthirst increases; see the [[vampire]] article for more information.
|-| {{text anchor|DRINKING_BLOOD}}| This appears to be created and set to a fixed value of 20 whilst the creature is sucking blood, and begins to decrease by 1 each [[time|tick]] once blood-sucking ceases (as described [[Syndrome#TIME_SINCE_SUCKED_BLOOD|above]]) until it reaches 0, at which point the counter is removed.

==Inorganic syndromes and you!==
It's perfectly possible - and quite simple - to add a nasty syndrome to a type of rock or metal - you simply add the syndrome tokens to the material definition in the same manner that you would add them to a creature material definition.  The only catch is that since your hapless dwarves will only normally encounter the material in metal, gem or boulder form, a bit of creativity must be used to actually get them inside your citizens - that is, you need to make them 'explosively boil' as soon as they're mined or produced.  This has the sad side effect of destroying the actual item - sorry, no highly radioactive uranium this release.  

The easiest way to accomplish this is to assign the material a low boiling point, usually just under room temperature, and make sure its temperature is fixed to a point above it.
  [MELTING_POINT:NONE]
  [BOILING_POINT:10000]
  [MAT_FIXED_TEMP:10001]
  [SPEC_HEAT:1]
Now, as soon as this substance hits the open air - by being mined, smelted or reaction-produced at a custom workshop - it will EXPLOSIVELY BOIL, flooding a small area with delicious syndrome-rich gas.  Creatures who inhale the gas will be immediately hit with the [[Syndrome#SYN_INHALED|SYN_INHALED]] syndrome you thoughtfully attached to the material definition earlier! Note that creatures do not need to inhale every tick, so there is a chance that the gas will dissipate before it can infect any particular creature.

There are a number of other tokens you can use to control the colour and naming conventions of your syndrome material, referred to as [[material definition token]]s.

==Spreading diseases==
It's fully possible to make a nasty disease capable of spreading itself from an infected dwarf to others, though it requires some skill in modding [[interaction token|interactions]] as well. Here is an example of a plague-inflicting interaction:

  [INTERACTION:PLAGUE]
  	[I_TARGET:A:CREATURE]
  		[IT_LOCATION:CONTEXT_CREATURE]
  		[IT_FORBIDDEN:NOT_LIVING]
  		[IT_AFFECTED_CLASS:GENERAL_POISON]
  		[IT_MANUAL_INPUT:creatures]
  	[I_EFFECT:ADD_SYNDROME]
  		[IE_TARGET:A]
  		[IE_IMMEDIATE]
  		[SYNDROME]
  			[SYN_NAME:the plague]
  			[SYN_AFFECTED_CLASS:GENERAL_POISON]
  			[CE_FEVER:SEV:250:PROB:100:START:250:PEAK:1500:END:25000]
  			[CE_BLISTERS:SEV:325:PROB:100:BP:BY_CATEGORY:ALL:SKIN:START:250:PEAK:1500:END:25000]
  			[CE_NECROSIS:SEV:300:PROB:100:BP:BY_CATEGORY:ALL:ALL:VASCULAR_ONLY:START:22500:PEAK:23750:END:25000]
  			[CE_CAN_DO_INTERACTION:START:1500:END:25000]
  				[CDI:ADV_NAME:Spread the plague]
  				[CDI:INTERACTION:PLAGUE]
  				[CDI:TARGET:A:LINE_OF_SIGHT]
  				[CDI:TARGET_RANGE:A:10]
  				[CDI:WAIT_PERIOD:30]

As you can see, the syndrome here inflicts blisters, fever and, after roughly a month, necrosis of the whole body - that's when the infected creatures will start dying out. But before that happens, CE_CAN_DO_INTERACTION makes them capable of spreading the plague further.

You also need a disease vector that will bring the plague straight to your fort. (hint: use [[large rat|various]] [[rat man|species]] [[giant rat|of rats]] - they're perfect for that). The following code, added to a creature's raws, ensures the creature will infect anybody it encounters:

  [CAN_DO_INTERACTION:PLAGUE]
  	[CDI:ADV_NAME:Spread the plague]
  	[CDI:TARGET:A:LINE_OF_SIGHT]
  	[CDI:TARGET_RANGE:A:10]
  	[CDI:WAIT_PERIOD:30]

As soon as the said creature is startled by your dwarves, the [[fun]] will begin.

It is also possible to use a creature's established methods of attack for use in disease-spreading.

Let's use the borrowed example of the plague above. This time, the plague will spread through biting, using the following syndrome code:

  [INTERACTION:PLAGUE]
  	[I_TARGET:A:CREATURE]
  		[IT_LOCATION:CONTEXT_CREATURE]
  		[IT_FORBIDDEN:NOT_LIVING]
  		[IT_AFFECTED_CLASS:GENERAL_POISON]
  		[IT_MANUAL_INPUT:creatures]
  	[I_EFFECT:ADD_SYNDROME]
  		[IE_TARGET:A]
  		[IE_IMMEDIATE]
  		[SYNDROME]
  			[SYN_NAME:the plague]
  			[SYN_AFFECTED_CLASS:GENERAL_POISON]
  			[CE_FEVER:SEV:250:PROB:100:START:250:PEAK:1500:END:25000]
  			[CE_BLISTERS:SEV:325:PROB:100:BP:BY_CATEGORY:ALL:SKIN:START:250:PEAK:1500:END:25000]
  			[CE_NECROSIS:SEV:300:PROB:100:BP:BY_CATEGORY:ALL:ALL:VASCULAR_ONLY:START:22500:PEAK:23750:END:25000]
  			[CE_SPECIAL_ATTACK_INTERACTION:INTERACTION:PLAGUE:BP:BY_CATEGORY:TOOTH:START:0:ABRUPT]


The line [CE_SPECIAL_ATTACK_INTERACTION:INTERACTION:BITE_PLAGUE:BP:BY_CATEGORY:MOUTH:BP:BY_CATEGORY:TOOTH:START:0:ABRUPT] allows any infected creature with an attack using mouth or tooth category body parts to immediately spread the disease using said attack. The victim of the attack may then spread the disease if they are able to attack with the needed body part/parts.

==Multi-caste/multi-creature body transformations==
This is a way to get around the {{text anchor|looping problem}} when using ANY or ALL castes for [[Syndrome#CE_BODY_TRANSFORMATION|CE_BODY_TRANSFORMATION]] and not being limited to a single creature for transformations. It's an incredibly simple solution as you can see in this example code:
{{code|code=
[SYNDROME]
	[SYN_NAME:draconic curse]
	[SYN_CLASS:DRACONIC_CURSE]
	[CE_BODY_TRANSFORMATION:PROB:25:START:0]
			[CE:CREATURE:HYDRA:MALE]
	[CE_BODY_TRANSFORMATION:PROB:33:START:0]
			[CE:CREATURE:DRAGON:MALE]
	[CE_BODY_TRANSFORMATION:PROB:50:START:0]
			[CE:CREATURE:HYDRA:FEMALE]
	[CE_BODY_TRANSFORMATION:PROB:100:START:0]
			[CE:CREATURE:DRAGON:FEMALE]}}
This code will transform a creature into either a female/male [[hydra]] or a female/male [[dragon]]. 

For every caste/creature you want a ''victim'' to transform into, you add a [CE_BODY_TRANSFORMATION] token with a [PROB] token attached to it. For each of the transformations, the PROB is set to ``100 / number_of_remaining_transformations`` (or different numbers if you want uneven odds), with the final transformation having a PROB of 100 to ensure there is always at least one transformation chosen. A creature can only have one active transformation at a time, so if any of the lower PROB transformations occurs then the PROB 100 transformation can not happen.

If you instead want a ''sequence'' of transformations to take place then you need make sure that one transformation ends on the same tick that the next one begins:
{{code|code=
[SYNDROME]
	[SYN_NAME:draconic sequence curse]
	[SYN_CLASS:DRACONIC_SEQUENCE_CURSE]
	[CE_BODY_TRANSFORMATION:PROB:100:START:0:END:10]
			[CE:CREATURE:HYDRA:MALE]
	[CE_BODY_TRANSFORMATION:PROB:100:START:10:END:20]
			[CE:CREATURE:DRAGON:MALE]
	[CE_BODY_TRANSFORMATION:PROB:100:START:20:END:30]
			[CE:CREATURE:HYDRA:FEMALE]
	[CE_BODY_TRANSFORMATION:PROB:100:START:30:END:40]
			[CE:CREATURE:DRAGON:FEMALE]}}
