'''Spider monkey men''' are an [[animal people]] variant of the rare [[spider monkey]], living in [[tropical]] [[broadleaf forest]]s, similarly to their precedents. They spawn in groups of 1-5 individuals and are generally content to keep to themselves. In terms of size, they are a little over half the weight of the average [[dwarf]].

Like other savage animal people, they can join [[civilization]]s, become [[historical figure]]s, appear as [[visitor]]s and be playable in [[adventurer mode]].

Some dwarves [[Preferences|like]] spider monkey men for their ''long arms'' and their ''prehensile tails''.

{{D for Dwarf}}
Despite some claiming otherwise, no spider monkey men have been known to possess abilities reminiscent of actual spiders, nor have any human children ever been known to transform into one.
