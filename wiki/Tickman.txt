'''Tick men''' are humanoid versions of the common [[tick]] and a [[Creature|species]] of [[animal people]], found in most [[savage]] [[biome]]s in small clusters of 1-3 individuals. They are only half the size of an adult [[dwarf]] and as such, are unlikely to be a threat to even an unarmed civilian. Like their vermin counterparts, tick men drain blood during bite attacks, which may lead to interesting scenarios if one attempts to bite a [[vampire]]. All tick men are born with Legendary [[skill]] in [[Climber|climbing]].

Like other savage animal people, tick men may occasionally join [[civilization]]s, becoming full-fledged citizens who may appear in your fortress as [[visitor]]s or be playable in [[adventurer mode]].

Some dwarves [[Preferences|like]] tick men for their ''ability to expand''.
