A '''wood furnace''' is a specialized form of [[furnace]] designed to burn fresh [[wood]]. Unlike the other non-[[magma]] furnaces, a wood furnace does not require fuel to operate.

==Uses==
Any dwarf with the [[wood burner]] [[labor]] enabled can burn a single log in order to produce either [[ash]] or [[charcoal]]. While it's hardly efficient, charcoal serves as the most ubiquitous form of [[fuel]] available to run a [[metal industry]] on. Ash sees use in multiple industries, such as [[glazing]] [[earthenware]] items, advanced [[glassmaking]], [[farm plot|crop fertilization]], and [[soap]] production.

==Construction==
Wood furnaces can be built from any [[fire-safe]] material. The overall value of the wood furnace building helps determine the strength of the good thought dwarves receive when admiring it. This value is determined by both the value of the material used in its construction, as well as the quality of the builder's efforts. {{Verify|is this still true in v50, now that architecture is gone?}}

==Minimalist start==
For players trying to maximize the value of their embark points, you may wish to avoid bringing finished [[battle axe]]s or [[pick]]s, choosing instead to bring metal ore, an anvil and fuel with you, so you can forge them yourself. Including a wood furnace can be extremely useful here, allowing you to turn logs into fuel much more cheaply than bringing coke, but you will need to bring a [[fire-safe]] stone for the [[furnaces]] and the [[Metalsmith's forge]].
