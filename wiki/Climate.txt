{{av}}'''Climate''' in ''Dwarf Fortress'' is a [[temperature]] rating used as a tool to define the [[weather]] patterns of a region. Most importantly, this will determine how the weather patterns of an area will affect above ground water sources. Overview of the temperature of an area is important for the lives of your dwarves and animals, as too-cold or too-hot temperatures will discourage or kill organic beings. Climate is a temperature rating only; actual ground cover is called a [[Biome|biome]].

''Note: If temperature is turned off, none of the mentioned effects will occur.''

== Climate Types ==
{| class=wikitable | rowspan=4 style="width:5px; background-color:black; text-align:center;"| <span style="color:{{fgcolor|4:1}}; font-family:Courier New;">Scorching</span>|-
! Peak Summer Temperature:| 122°F (50°C) and above (corresponding to a worldgen temperature of 120+?)|-
! Availability of water:| Any existing [[murky pool]] will dry up immediately. [[River]]s are unaffected.|-
! When embarking in this region:| If no river or [[ocean]] is available, it is hard to survive in this climate. Your only chance is to find a cave with water.
In extremely hot regions (above {{ct|10078}} (or 104 in the worldgen max temperature setting?)), [[dwarves]] and livestock may die from the heat (specifically, the fat in their bodies will ''melt'', causing them to bleed to death) if they remain outdoors for extended periods of time.
|-| rowspan=4 style="background-color:black; text-align:center;"| <span style="color:{{fgcolor|4:1}}; font-family:Courier New;">Hot</span>|-
! Peak Summer Temperature| 107-121°F (41-49°C) (100-118 in worldgen?)|-
! Availability of water| In dry biomes, [[murky pool]]s may evaporate during dry [[season]]s (usually [[summer]]) but can be refilled by [[rain]].
[[River]]s are unaffected.|-
! When embarking in this region| If you lack a [[river]], be sure to dig out a [[reservoir|cistern]] before summer is upon you.
|-| rowspan=4 style="background-color:black; text-align:center;"| <span style="color:{{fgcolor|6:1}}; font-family:Courier New;">Warm</span>|-
! Peak Summer Temperature| 82-106°F (28-41°C) (67-98 in worldgen?)|-
! Availability of water| Any water source can be used during the whole year. This makes it the easiest climate to embark on. Very rarely, especially when very close to the edge of a temperate biome, one can have an extremely brief period of water freezing, usually only lasting a few days, thus providing no danger of death by thirst.|-
! When embarking in this region| Keep in mind that murky pools can still dry up from repeated usage, especially with large populations. Try to find an alternate water source if the region is dry.
|-| rowspan=4 style="background-color:black; text-align:center;"| <span style="color:{{fgcolor|2:0}}; font-family:Courier New;">Temperate</span>|-
! Peak Summer Temperature| 47-82°F (8-27°C) (20-66 in worldgen?)|-
! Availability of water| Surface [[pool]]s and rivers may freeze for part of the year.  The length of the freeze varies: pools and rivers may thaw sometime in [[spring]], remaining liquid until [[winter]]; or they may already be liquid at the beginning of spring, and freeze for only a month or so in winter.|-
! When embarking in this region| If you lack a [[river]], you can dig out a [[reservoir|cistern]] in the non-freezing seasons. You can also use a source of heat (such as [[magma]]) to obtain liquid [[water]]. If the ground is covered in snow when you arrive, be sure to scout out the surface pools so that none of your dwarves find themselves [[Swimming|suddenly submerged]] when the pools thaw later in the spring.
|-| rowspan=4 style="background-color:black; text-align:center;"| <span style="color:{{fgcolor|1:1}}; font-family:Courier New;">Cold</span>|-
! Peak Summer Temperature| 33-46°F (1-8°C)  (2-18 in worldgen?)|-
! Availability of water| Surface pools and rivers are usually frozen, but can thaw for a few months each year.|-
! When embarking in this region| The same measures as in temperate biomes can be taken.
|-| rowspan=4 style="background-color:black; text-align:center;"| <span style="color:{{fgcolor|3:1}}; font-family:Courier New;">Freezing</span>|-
! Peak Summer Temperature:| 32°F (0°C) or less (0 or below in worldgen)|-
! Availability of water:| Freshwater surface pools and rivers remain frozen throughout the year.|-
! When embarking in this region:| You must use a source of heat ([[magma]]) to obtain liquid [[water]]. Glacial ice can also be melted. Another option is an underground source of water. ''See [[Freezing]] for more details.''

In extremely cold regions (below {{ct|9964}}, -48 in the worldgen scale), [[dwarves]] and livestock may succumb to frostbite if they remain outdoors for extended periods of time. [[trade goods|Goods]] left outdoors may experience [[wear]] at an accelerated rate. [[Embark]] goods should be stored below ground as soon as possible, and [[trade depot]]s should be built below ground.|}
