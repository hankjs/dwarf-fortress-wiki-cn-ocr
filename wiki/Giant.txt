'''Giants''' are massive [[fanciful]] [[creature]]s resembling oversized [[human]]s, and the largest of all [[semi-megabeast]]s. They inhabit [[Lair#Burrow|burrows]] and will attack fortresses once a certain amount of [[wealth]] is accumulated. Female giants are known as ''giantesses''.

When assaulting a fort, giants will [[Building destroyer|destroy building]]s and pummel any [[dwarf]] civilian unlucky enough to get in their path into mush. However, they are less of a threat than the likes of an [[ettin]] or a [[minotaur]], due to lacking their immunity to stunning, and proficiency with [[weapon]]s, respectively. Giants are intelligent creatures but do not naturally possess [[skills]], and also only learn them at half the rate of a civilized creature (unlike any of their semi-megabeast cousins), meaning their only real weapon is generally brute strength. That being said, giants are still the largest of their semi-megabeast kin and should be dispatched accordingly.

Despite their huge size, giants are as vulnerable to a [[cage]] [[trap]] as any other creature. Since they are intelligent, dwarves will not [[Animal trainer|train]] or [[butcher]] them, limiting their use to [[live training]] or decorating the fort by placing them somewhere to your liking.

Beware of giants and other [[semi-megabeast]]s who ''have'' managed to substantially increase their skills, which, by the way, is something no [[megabeast]] is able to do.

Some dwarves [[Preferences|like]] giants for their ''height''.

{{D for Dwarf}}
''Dwarf Fortress'' giants do not herd mammoths, nor do they make mammoth [[cheese]]. They also lack the ability to smash their foes a million feet into the air, nor are their toes (always) easy for the taking once they die. Contrary to popular belief, giants do not live at the top of beanstalks.
