'''Bobcats''' are small feline [[creature]]s found in a variety of [[biome]]s. Extremely uncommon to encounter, they spawn individually, and no more than a measly 3 of them will exist in one map before being considered locally [[extinct]]. While carnivorous, they're only a little larger than common [[cat]]s and will rarely, if ever pose a threat to any adult [[dwarf]]. Bobcat kittens take 3 years to reach adulthood, a strange characteristic for an animal so small.

Bobcats can be captured in [[cage]] [[trap]]s and [[Animal trainer|trained]] into [[pet]]s. They can be further turned into war or hunting beasts, but the fact they're under half the size of a [[dog]] simply makes them too small to be of any effect. Products made from bobcat parts are worth twice as much as those made from common animals, though as noted, unless the player purposely breeds them, they'll run out of bobcats to use extremely quickly.

Some dwarves [[Preferences|like]] bobcats for their ''short tails''.
