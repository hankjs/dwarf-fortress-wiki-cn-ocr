''Dwarf Fortress'' started as a pretty complex game back in the days when it was 2D and barely had a quarter of the features it has now. It's easy to get overwhelmed when you first fire it up. Don't worry though, following a tutorial is a very easy way to learn the basics of the game in an afternoon.

Don't worry if you don't understand why you do things on your first run, even after reading the tutorial's explanation. If one particular thing bugs you, try starting a new fort and skipping it, then seeing what goes wrong! Especially in the current version, trial and error is great way of having lots of [[fun]].

== Installing and Running the Game ==

If you have not installed the game yet, see [[Installation]].

== Learning Fortress Mode ==

Most of the tutorials were written for the older (40d) version of ''Dwarf Fortress'', but nonetheless, they are still helpful. If you get stuck within a specific aspect of the game, then [[Special:Search|search]] the wiki and don't hesitate to ask questions in the [http://www.bay12forums.com/smf/index.php?board=7.0 forum].

The following tutorials will walk you through world generation, embarking with your 7 dwarves, game basics, and building a full-fledged fortress.

==Adventurer Mode==
{{main|Adventurer mode}}
Adventure mode tutorials are less common than for fortress mode. Also, some of the adventure mode wiki content is in sections on related pages, rather than on adventure mode-specific pages; the [[Adventurer mode|main page]] provides an overview with links to the sections or pages with more information.
