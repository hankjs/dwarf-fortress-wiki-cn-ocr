'''Creeping eyes''' are small, four-armed [[evil]] [[creature|monsters]] that can be found in the deepest [[caverns]] in large packs. They have no attacks whatsoever, apart from the standard [[push]] attack, but they are so small they will rarely ever hurt a [[dwarf]].

[[Trap design|Drowning chambers]] do not work on creeping eyes, as they have {{token|NOBREATHE|c}}. The same 5 z-level pit trap, capable of killing dozens of [[blind cave ogre]]s with assembly-line efficiency, doesn't even damage these hardy creatures. Your best bet is your [[military]], even though creeping eyes have a lot of excess targetable body parts and only one weak point: the heart. 

Creeping eyes possess a [[pet]] value of 50, but lack the necessary tokens to be [[animal trainer|trainable]]. All creeping eyes possess Legendary [[skill]] in [[climber|climbing]] and are biologically immortal, only dying from violence or disease. When encountered in [[adventurer mode]], they will glow in the dark. They can't be spawned in the [[object testing arena]].

Some dwarves [[Preference|like]] creeping eyes for their ''unnerving stare''.

{{D for dwarf}}
Interestingly, despite feeding on evil alone creeping eyes have intestines, implying that evil can be metabolized. Because of this, it is widely believed that bars of [[soap]] derived from the evil-saturated fat of creeping eyes is a powerful dwarven aphrodisiac (beard strengthener).
