'''Carambola''' (also called starfruit) is one of the many genera of trees found above ground. Like the vast majority of above ground trees, carambola [[wood]] is brown and produces brown products.

Carambola trees bear carambola [[fruit]] that can be harvested by setting up a gathering [[zone]]. They can be eaten raw, cooked, or brewed into [[alcohol|carambola wine]].

Some [[Dwarf|dwarves]] [[Preferences|like]] carambola trees for their ''fruit''.
