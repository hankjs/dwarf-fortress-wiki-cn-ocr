[[File:love_preview.png|right]][[Dwarves]] have '''relationships''' amongst each other. These can be seen in detail by going to the dwarf's [[profile]], and pressing {{k|r}} to take you to their relationships screen. Relationships are usually formed by spending time with another dwarf.  Often, the strongest relationships are between dwarves from the same [[migrant]] wave, despite time spent with dwarves from other waves. Relationships are important because their presence or absence has an important effect on the dwarf in question. Note that when it comes to familial relationships, the dwarves in question do not have to be in your fortress.    

Making and talking to friends gives happy [[thought]]s, while death - of a [[pet]], friend, parent, [[children|child]] or [[marriage|spouse]] - gives unhappy ones. Dwarves in a network of friends and family are happier than otherwise, but are more likely to make [[children]], and will be much harder-hit when a familiar dwarf dies in an [[ambush]] or whatnot. Getting [[ghost|haunted]] by a familiar dwarf produces a strong negative thought as well.

(Note that the relationships screen is mouse-enabled.)

== Types ==
The following is a list of known relationships, listed in the order they appear on the screen (and thus, their importance):
* Kin relationships
**'''Spouse''' - [[Marriage|Married]] dwarves are spouses of one another, and will share a [[bed]]. Heterosexual couples will produce children (the happier the couple, the more [[Marriage|often?]]).
**'''Lover''' - Lovers are basically dwarven pairs; unmarried, but getting there. Dwarves may have multiple lovers. Dwarves who are lovers and marriage-compatible (as per their {{token|ORIENTATION|c}} token) and that spend enough time chatting may marry, at which point they will begin using the same bed, and start producing children if belonging to opposite genders.
**'''Child''' - Any [[child]]ren that dwarven parents have are the objects of their attention - this includes grown adults, minors, and babies.  Children are described by their sex and birth order.  The relationship is described as eldest son, second eldest son, eldest daughter, and so on.  The child might not necessarily be in the fortress. Even if born as twins, one will be older and one will be younger. 
**'''Parent''' - If the dwarf has known parents, they will appear here.
**'''Grandparent''' - Like known parents. They're separated into "paternal" and "maternal". (In listing order, may be mixed with siblings)
**'''Sibling''' - If the dwarf in question has siblings, they will appear here. Like children, they do not necessarily have to be in the fortress.  The relationships are described as older brother, younger brother, older sister, and younger sister (creatures with one or more genderless castes, such as [[Ant man]], also may have older/younger siblings). If dwarves share only one parent, they are described as above, but with half- (half-brother, half-sister etc). Even if born as twins, one will count as older than another. 
**'''Aunt/Uncle''' - If the dwarf has known aunts or uncles, they will appear here. Often these don't live in the same fortress.
**'''Niece/Nephew''' - If the dwarf has known nieces or nephews, they will appear here. Again, nieces and nephews often don't live in the same fortress.
**'''Cousin''' - If the dwarf has known cousins, they will appear here. Cousins, much like some of the above categories, often don't live in the fortress. 
* Spiritual relationships
**'''Deity''' - Ye olde dwarven [[deity|god]]s are the most important non-familial relationships for a dwarf.  A dwarf can worship multiple gods, and on rare occasions will not worship any (atheism). Dwarves can have different levels of worship ("ardent", "faithful", "casual", and "dubious"). Note that cursed creatures are ''always'' dubious worshippers of their deities, making this relationship an important sign of a [[vampire]]. A [[temple]] may be designated as a [[location]] from a [[meeting area]]. Worshiping at a temple reduces [[stress]] by a large amount, but not being able to worship causes further stress to develop.
**'''Object of Worship''' - Dwarves tend to worship [[megabeast]]s that have attacked a settlement, most likely out of fear. This relationship is, for now, only aesthetic, and does not change the behavior of the dwarf or the megabeast if the worshipper meets the worshipped.
**'''Force''' - An [[elf]] may worship a [[force|force of nature]], which works the same as worship of a deity.
* Professional relationships
**'''Apprentice''' - [[Scholar]]s, [[performer]]s, and [[necromancer]]s can take apprentices, who they will teach what they know. Apprentices sometimes don't live in the fortress. One master can have many apprentices.
**'''Master''' - Master to an apprentice. Sometimes migrants and visitors have masters that don't live in the fortress.
**'''Former Master''' - A creature can have more than one former master.
**'''Former Apprentice''' - A creature that once learned from this one.
* Animal relationships
**'''[[Pet]]''' - The dwarf's [[animal]] companion, who they have adopted (or in the case of [[cat]]s, the dwarf was adopted by them). If the pet is a [[grazer]], the owner will periodically feed them, allowing them to roam free without the need of a [[pasture]]. Dwarves can have multiple pets. In [[Legends mode]] pets have a link to their '''owner''', but if certain viewing utilities are used, the relationship list of the pet will have no link to the owner ("Thoughts and preferences" will still have the name of the owner).
**'''Bonded animal''' - [[Animal trainer]]s typically form bonds with the animals they work with over time. The death of a bonded animal causes a bad thought to the trainer.
* Non-kin personal relationships
**'''Kindred spirit''' - A step above close friend, a step below lover.
**'''Companion''' - may be found on adventurers, if you retired them in your retired fortress and then unretire that fortress.
**'''Close friend''' - A close friend, yet neither a kindred spirit nor a lover.
**'''Friend''' - Dwarves that idle near other dwarves and/or have high [[social skill]]s tend to develop [[friend]]s. Making a friend takes some effort on the part of the dwarf, and happens most often within individual waves. [[Personality|Personalities]] play a part as well. Making friends causes a happy thought, as can be expected, and the death of friends causes unhappy ones. Lovers develop from a dwarf's pool of friends.
**'''Grudge''' - [[Grudge]]s are the opposite of friendships, and tend to develop between dwarves of conflicting personality traits. Sometimes, it is possible to have your starting dwarves form grudges even before they arrive at the new fortress location. Making a grudge causes an unhappy thought, but ironically, the death of a grudgee actually causes a bad thought as well.
**'''Friendly Terms''' - More than an acquaintance, less than a friend.{{verify}}
**'''Long-term Acquaintance''' - Long-term acquaintances are dwarves that have had at least 30 conversations with each other, but aren't friends. At [[embark]], the seven starting dwarves will each be either long-term acquaintances or be friends (friends, good friends or kindred spirits) with each other (or in very rare cases have a grudge). Long-term Acquaintance relationships currently do not form between dwarves in fortress mode.
**'''Passing Acquaintance''' - Passing acquaintances are dwarves that are familiar with one another, but just barely. As long term acquaintances do not produce a bad thought, passing ones do not either. If an acquaintance does not make contact with the dwarf over a time, they will be forgotten, absent from the relationships screen.

==Non-kin relationships of citizens created in fortress mode==
The non-kin relationships (and not only passing acquaintance relationships) between dwarves in fortress mode can currently deteriorate over time, if there is no contact between the two dwarves, between the first (tick of the first) day of Granite and the last (tick of the last) day of Obsidian of a year, the non-kin relationship (at least below lover) is removed with the start of the new year. The relationships between the seven starting dwarves are not affected by this (and presumably also non-kin relationships, which are non-passing acquaintance relationships generated during worldgen, are not affected). But for all other non-kin relationships (below lover) it is possible. EG: two dwarves, who had been kindred spirits, will no longer acknowledge the existence of the other dwarf (with the beginning of a year), if there has been no (social) contact between the two dwarves in the past calendar year. 

The same mechanic is used to remove caravan traders (and presumably other guests/visitors) from the relationships of the dwarf citizens.

For the seven starting dwarves, on the other hand, the non-kin relationships can only increase (at least if they do not have a grudge) and a long-term acquaintance can become a friend, good friend or kindred spirit (or even more) over time. 

It is currently not clear, as to why non-kin relationships between the seven starting dwarves are handled differently in comparison to newly created non-kin relationships generated during fortress mode.

==Other familial relationships==
Dwarves can have '''Uncles''', '''Aunts''', '''Nieces''', '''Nephews''' and '''Cousins''' listed as relationships. They do not appear to take special interest in the wellbeing of such relations. Migrants with long lists of such "extended family" are typically well-connected historical personalities, but expansive relative lists of this type also commonly appear when children in a fort manage to grow up to adulthood, marry and have children of their own. 
As historical personages of special importance, [[monarch]]s frequently immigrate with a large number of distant relatives listed.

==Types of friendships==

In world generation, characters make friendships due to worldgen events, and those friendships may carry over to fortress mode when some of them [[migrate]]. Those are:

* Childhood friendships
* Bonding over [[scholar]]ly interests 
* Bonding over art at performances
* Friends from athletic competitions
* War buddies

==Types of grudges==

Like friendships, grudges can also happen during worldgen, and usually pave the way to more general corruption from [[villain]]s. These can spawn from:

* Business rivalries
* Sport competitions
* Abusive rulers
* Religious grievances...Sometimes very specific grudges can happen, such as a [[mummy]] forming one against a [[tomb]] thief.

==Relationship variables==

On top of the existing relationships, there are variables that govern the attitude between two characters. This usually comes up during corruption attempts by [[villain]]s in worldgen (e.g. intimidation is more successful if the target fears the villain already, and flattery works better if the target trusts them) and is especially relevant during interrogations in both fortress and adventure mode. Those variables are:

* Loyalty
* Trust/distrust
* Fear
* Love/hate
* Respect

==Night troll relationships==

After abducting someone, a [[night troll]] makes its victim into a '''prisoner''' and becomes an '''imprisoner'''; that relationship may be seen in legends mode, and (if using DFHack) in the thoughts and preferences screen. Then the prisoner and imprisoner become just ordinary spouses, if during worldgen, otherwise (at least in fortmode) the night troll can't convert the prisoner into a proper spouse caste, and so the prisoner is stuck forever.{{verify}}

==Growing relationships==
Over time, dwarves who spend time idling near each other will begin to form friendships and grudges. This happens through 'chats' and the 'socialize' activity.

Two dwarves who are standing on the same or adjacent tiles, may decide to chat if they are idle. Dwarves who are busy eating, drinking, or doing any job, will not chat with one another. This has the amusingly realistic effect that two dwarves who work side by side for years may barely know each other, or even not at all.

As two dwarves accumulate these chats, they will form opinions of each other, based on a 'compatibility' score. Dwarves who like similar things (such as [[elephant]]s), have the same skills (such as two miners), or who have similar personalities can form friendships (if their personality facets permit it). These begin as passing acquaintances, who will then become friends (if the two aren't too incompatible) or form grudges (if the dwarves are too incompatible). Currently, only vastly different [[personality|personalities]] (such as a confident, selfless dwarf vs. a nervous but arrogant one) cause this, as differences in likes or skills don't hurt a dwarf's opinion of another. Changes in a dwarf's skill set can thus cause their opinions of another dwarf to change, potentially removing old grudges. Dwarves who don't chat will lose acquaintances (and friends) over time.

Some personality facets (like love_propensity, emotionally_obsessive and gregariousness) seem to play a big role in how fast (or slow) friendships are formed and could also possibly mean that some dwarves will not ever consider anyone a kindred spirit (unless the dwarfs personality facets change through core memories), regardless of how long (and often) they chat with each other.

Dwarves who are compatible enough, and chat enough, can become lovers (if their personality facets permit it). In order to be eligible for this, a dwarf has to be an adult, not have a too-large age difference (which is currently max(10,min(age_1,age_2)/2), be orientation-compatible, and not be too closely related to their new friend. Lovers who continue to have enough opportunities to chat, and are willing to commit as per their [[orientation]] preferences will eventually get married (if their personality facets permit it).

[[Social skill]]s such as [[broker skills|conversationalist]], [[intimidator]], [[pacifier]], [[comedian]], [[negotiator]], [[flatterer]], [[consoler]], [[persuader]], or [[judge of intent]] play no roles in relationships.

It is possible for two dwarves to have different opinions about each other - for example, Urist can treat Bomrek as a long-term acquainted buddy, while Bomrek counts Urist as a barely recognised person.

===Mechanics===
# Relations are formed the first time a unit is idle or socializing next to another unit*
# When a relationship rank hits 15, a friendship or grudge is formed, depending on compatibility.
# When the rank is around 40, if the units are friends and are romantically inclined, they become lovers. A range of 31-42 has been observed, probably influenced by one or more personality traits.
# When the rank hits 50, and the units are lovers, they can get married.
# Talking to grudges can really spike a unit's stress level (700+ per day), depending on personality.
# Socializing units can increase rank with busy adjacent units if they don't move (tested with pumpstacks, libraries, and temples).


&nbsp;* - It doesn't look like units begin socializing with same-tile or diagonally adjacent units. Only N,S,E,W adjacent units can start socialization, but, once started, socializing dwarves will include same-tile and diagonal neighbors.
