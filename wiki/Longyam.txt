'''Long yams''' are an [[aboveground]] [[crop|garden plant]]. They can be planted in all seasons and are edible raw or [[cooking|cooked]]. 

Long yams are the only type of yam that can be eaten raw. However, because they cannot be brewed or otherwise processed, waiting for your dwarves to eat them is the only way to get seeds, making them a difficult crop to plan around.

Some [[Dwarf|dwarves]] [[preferences|like]] long yam plants for their ''tubers''.
