'''Amphibious''' creatures (those with the {{token|AMPHIBIOUS}} [[token]]) can move and breathe underwater and on dry land, and can path into your fortress down any unshielded waterworks. They can spawn on flooded map edges, and, in the case of large predators like [[cave crocodile]]s, may prove quite dangerous to [[fishing|fisherdwarfs]]. Amphibious creatures that also have the {{token|MOUNT}} or {{token|MOUNT_EXOTIC}} token can be ridden by (air-breathing) [[siege]]rs into combat, which causes some hilarity when entire [[squad]]s of [[goblin]]s perish because their [[alligator]]s dove into your [[moat]].
