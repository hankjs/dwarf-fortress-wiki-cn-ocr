Would you like your fortress located in a forested mineral-rich region of this world where you can play through a short tutorial? 
Quick start and short tutorial?
Deal with challenges as they arise, and you might one day find that your humble settlement has grown to become a Mountainhome, the center of your civilization.
As you dig deeper and more citizens take up residence in your outpost, your doings will attract attention, both wanted and unwanted. 
Once this process is complete, you can prepare a group and send them out to seek wealth deep in the mountains. 
You'll begin by creating your world and watching the region's history unfold. 
Prepare to guide your stout charges to fortune in a world fraught with many perils.

After you embark, help is available by pressing the help button in the top right corner, including all of the tutorials.
Some locations are challenging even for experienced players, and it will be a very short game indeed if you don't know how to deal with them!

If you have some [C:6:0:1]Wood[C:7:0:0] stockpiled, you'll be able to place a [C:6:0:0]Carpenter's Workshop[C:7:0:0].  
Most [C:6:0:0]Workshops[C:7:0:0] require building material, such as [C:6:0:1]Wood[C:7:0:0] or [C:6:0:1]Boulders[C:7:0:0].  
[C:6:0:0]Workshops[C:7:0:0] are one of many buildings you can place with the highlighted [C:5:0:1]Build[C:7:0:0] button.  Click it now.
Now that you have the building materials it's time to start building.

If all of your [C:6:0:0]Stockpiles[C:7:0:0] are full, go ahead and place another one.
You can right click to close [C:5:0:1]Woodcutting[C:7:0:0] mode.  Right clicking closes most menus.
If the fallen logs are accessible, everyone will help store them in the [C:6:0:0]Stockpile[C:7:0:0].  
Now we just need to wait for the woodcutter to chop down the tree.  
Make sure your woodcutter can walk to the designated location.
When you are ready, open the [C:5:0:1]Woodcutting[C:7:0:0] menu and designate the trunk of a tree on the surface.  
[C:2:0:0]Haulers[C:7:0:0] will also drop [C:6:0:1]Wood[C:7:0:0] in your [C:6:0:0]All Stockpile[C:7:0:0] unless you turn it off in the [C:5:0:1]Custom Stockpile Menu[C:7:0:0].
Before you start chopping down trees you may want to create a dedicated [C:6:0:0]Wood Stockpile[C:7:0:0].  
First you need building materials, like [C:6:0:1]Wood[C:7:0:0] or [C:6:0:1]Boulders[C:7:0:0].

You can also access information from the [C:5:0:1]Citizens[C:7:0:0] button.

Use the [C:5:0:1]Build[C:7:0:0] menu to place it in a room underground, just like the [C:6:0:0]Workshop[C:7:0:0].  Dig a new room first if you like.  
Now that you have a [C:6:0:1]Bed[C:7:0:0] you can place in it the fortress.  
Chop down more trees if necessary.  Unpause and wait for the [C:6:0:1]Bed[C:7:0:0] to be completed.
[C:6:0:1]Furniture[C:7:0:0] created at the [C:6:0:0]Carpenter's Workshop[C:7:0:0] usually takes one [C:6:0:1]Wood[C:7:0:0] to build.  Add a task and make a [C:6:0:1]Bed[C:7:0:0].  
Most objects that are placed, like [C:6:0:1]Doors[C:7:0:0] and [C:6:0:1]Furniture[C:7:0:0], must first be built in a [C:6:0:0]Workshop[C:7:0:0].  
Your industrious citizens will perform any task added to the [C:6:0:0]Workshop[C:7:0:0].  
Once the worker is done, click on the building to select it.
When unpaused, a worker should now build the [C:6:0:0]Workshop[C:7:0:0].
[C:6:0:1]Crafts[C:7:0:0] are an easy way to make a lot of trade goods quickly. 
You need something of value to trade. 
To trade with the autumn caravan, you must build a [C:6:0:0]Trade Depot[C:7:0:0] from the [C:5:0:1]Build[C:7:0:0] menu.
You may need supplies before the coming of winter.

Later you may try the [C:5:0:1]Burrows[C:7:0:0] menu to create a safe place for your civilians to hide when real trouble comes.
To make sure they spend their free time down there you will need to use the [C:5:0:1]Zones[C:7:0:0] menu to create a [C:3:0:0]Meeting Area[C:7:0:0]. 
By now you should have a room underground where your residents can hide from the creatures above.

If you dig down enough layers you will find a near infinite amount of [C:6:0:1]Boulders[C:7:0:0] of various 
An obvious material to use to make the crafts is rock.

The main way is by brewing alcohol. 
There are two ways to make drinks for your residents.

This isn't rich soil, but will suffice for now.  Dig deeper to find better soil. 
With a subterranean soil floor exposed, you can place an underground [C:6:0:0]Farmplot[C:7:0:0]. 
Make sure to leave the ceiling above intact so the underground soil doesn't receive any sunlight.
The highest mountain elevations do not have soil. 
The underground rectangle must be near the surface, where there is soil (loam, clay, or sand.) One level down should suffice, before you hit rock. 
Using [C:5:0:1]Mining[C:7:0:0] orders, you'll need to carve out a rectangular area underground for your [C:6:0:0]Farmplot[C:7:0:0]. 
The [C:6:0:0]Wagon[C:7:0:0] comes with some [C:6:0:1]Seeds[C:7:0:0], but as you might expect, these crops must be grown underground!
There's some food on the embark [C:6:0:0]Wagon[C:7:0:0], and you can trade for food, but you can also grow your own.

Do this by selecting [C:5:0:1]Workshops[C:7:0:0] -> [C:5:0:1]Farming[C:7:0:0] -> [C:5:0:1]Fishery[C:7:0:0].
Remember, your workers do not eat raw fish!  You must build a [C:6:0:0]Fishery[C:7:0:0] to prepare them. 
You can optionally choose to designate a [C:3:0:0]Fishing[C:7:0:0] zone if you don't want your workers going far afield.
fishing labor assigned will begin fishing automatically.
If there is a river or pond nearby you may consider fishing.  If the water isn't frozen, a worker with the

[C:6:0:1]Fertilizer[C:7:0:0] is not needed to farm.
[C:6:0:1]Potash[C:7:0:0] is the fertilizer of choice, and it can be created in the [C:6:0:0]Ashery[C:7:0:0], using [C:6:0:1]Ash[C:7:0:0] from [C:6:0:1]Wood[C:7:0:0] burned in a [C:6:0:0]Wood Furnace[C:7:0:0].  A [C:3:0:0]Water Source[C:7:0:0] zone and a [C:6:0:1]Bucket[C:7:0:0] are also required. 
These effects are more pronounced deep underground where you can locate the cavern biome and its rich soil.
[C:6:0:1]Fertilizer[C:7:0:0] and skilled [C:2:0:0]Planters[C:7:0:0] have a direct impact on crop yield. 
If you'd like to focus a few of your citizens on farming, which gives skill benefits, you can assign them to the [C:2:0:0]Planters[C:7:0:0] work detail from the [C:5:0:1]Labor[C:7:0:0] menu. 
Now your [C:2:0:0]Planters[C:7:0:0], those that can access both the [C:6:0:0]Farmplot[C:7:0:0] and the [C:6:0:1]Spawn[C:7:0:0], will plant the field, and after a period of growth, they'll be harvested. 
Note that you can obtain aboveground [C:6:0:1]Seeds[C:7:0:0] from trade or by eating gathered [C:6:0:1]Plants[C:7:0:0], but aboveground farming exposes your [C:2:0:0]Planters[C:7:0:0] to dangers and the elements.
[C:6:0:1]Plump Helmets[C:7:0:0] are edible and the default [C:6:0:0]Wagon[C:7:0:0] comes with [C:6:0:1]Plump Helmet Spawn[C:7:0:0], which are their "seeds".
Click on the [C:6:0:0]Farmplot[C:7:0:0] you placed to pull up the [C:5:0:1]Farming[C:7:0:0] menu.
You need to select the crops to be grown each season. 
[C:3:0:0]Zones[C:7:0:0] are placed much like [C:6:0:0]Stockpiles[C:7:0:0]. 
There are several kinds of [C:3:0:0]Zones[C:7:0:0], which you can see in the panel on the left.
[C:3:0:0]Zones[C:7:0:0] are areas you designate where your citizens will work, socialize, rest, or perform specific duties.

To keep them alive use the [C:3:0:0]Pen/Pasture[C:7:0:0] zone from the [C:5:0:1]Zones[C:7:0:0] menu to select a section of grass and click the 
Note that some [C:2:0:0]Livestock[C:7:0:0] must eat vegetation to survive. 
There you can select which [C:2:0:0]Animals[C:7:0:0] to slaughter.  You may need to minimize the tutorial to see the [C:5:0:1]Slaughter[C:7:0:0] buttons.
Once the shop is built, open the [C:5:0:1]Creatures[C:7:0:0] info menu.  From there select the [C:5:0:1]Pets/Livestock[C:7:0:0] tab. 
Do this by selecting the building in [C:5:0:1]Workshops[C:7:0:0] -> [C:5:0:1]Farming[C:7:0:0] -> [C:5:0:1]Butcher[C:7:0:0]. 
To slaughter an [C:2:0:0]Animal[C:7:0:0] you must first build a [C:6:0:0]Butcher's Shop[C:7:0:0]. 
[C:6:0:1]Meat[C:7:0:0] from [C:2:0:0]Livestock[C:7:0:0] you slaughter is a source of food.

When a route has a steep descent, consider using powered [C:6:0:0]Rollers[C:7:0:0], extra curves, track "stops" between [C:6:0:0]Stops[C:7:0:0] with various friction settings, or a worker to guide the vehicle.
[C:6:0:1]Minecarts[C:7:0:0] that move too quickly around corners will spill their contents. 
Only one condition needs to be satisfied for the [C:6:0:1]Minecart[C:7:0:0] to move to the next [C:6:0:0]Track Stop[C:7:0:0].
Each [C:6:0:0]Track Stop[C:7:0:0] must be linked to a [C:6:0:0]Stockpile[C:7:0:0] for [C:6:0:1]Items[C:7:0:0] to be put on or removed from the [C:6:0:1]Minecart[C:7:0:0].
One [C:6:0:1]Minecart[C:7:0:0] can be assigned to each route, and workers will move the vehicle from [C:6:0:0]Track Stop[C:7:0:0] to [C:6:0:0]Track Stop[C:7:0:0] according to conditions you specify.
[C:6:0:1]Minecarts[C:7:0:0] and [C:6:0:0]Tracks[C:7:0:0] are a convenient way to move a lot of objects around the fortress quickly, though they take a little effort to prepare. 
Minecart routes
It can be useful to assign all of your civilians to a safe emergency [C:1:0:0]Burrow[C:7:0:0] which you activate in case of intruders.
[C:1:0:0]Burrows[C:7:0:0] can be suspended and unsuspended freely.  When a [C:1:0:0]Burrow[C:7:0:0] is suspended, assigned citizens will ignore it.
Workers will try to limit their tasks to the confines of the [C:1:0:0]Burrow[C:7:0:0], but they will sometimes form paths which pass through other areas.
[C:1:0:0]Burrows[C:7:0:0] are work and living areas where citizens can be assigned. 
Just make sure you have the correct [C:6:0:0]Furniture[C:7:0:0] placed in the rooms with [C:6:0:0]Doors[C:7:0:0] or vertical entries separating each room before you begin.
Certain [C:3:0:0]Zones[C:7:0:0] like [C:3:0:0]Bedrooms[C:7:0:0] can be placed several at a time. 
Unlike [C:6:0:0]Stockpiles[C:7:0:0], multiple [C:3:0:0]Zones[C:7:0:0] can overlap.
Nobles and certain administrators require rooms, and some may also make demands.
Once they are assigned, you can create work orders, run a [C:1:0:1]Hospital[C:7:0:0], and count and appraise your hoard.
Certain important functions in your fortress can only be performed by assigned administrators, such as the [C:5:0:0]Manager[C:7:0:0] and [C:5:0:0]Bookkeeper[C:7:0:0]. 
These can also be assigned from the squad menu.
Once the first leader is assigned, subsequent [C:5:0:0]Captain[C:7:0:0] positions will appear. 
[C:5:0:0]Militia Commanders[C:7:0:0] are assigned here. 
Here you can view your nobles, as well as assign your administrators, military leaders, and other officials.
Nobles and administrators
If a task does not have a default work detail, you can create a custom work detail.  Once you assign citizens to the task, you can then set [C:5:0:1]"Only selected do this"[C:7:0:0] if you want to restrict it.
Tasks are restricted by setting their work detail to [C:5:0:1]"Only selected do this"[C:7:0:0].
Citizens are restricted by using their [C:5:0:1]Specialization[C:7:0:0] button. 
Generally, almost every task will be available for every citizen, but you can both restrict both citizens and tasks. 
Work details are one way you can control which workers do which tasks, and they are the only way to assign certain tasks like mining, woodcutting, hunting, and fishing. 
If you don't have a [C:5:0:0]Bookkeeper[C:7:0:0], or they don't have an [C:3:0:0]Office[C:7:0:0] to work in, numbers may be approximate.
Click on category headings to collapse and expand them. 
Here you can see every [C:6:0:1]Item[C:7:0:0] in the fortress. 
You have no idea what's lurking out there.
It is recommended that you prepare a squad and get them training as soon as you can. 
Wildlife and even your own citizens can still be dangerous at times.
Although this location is relatively safe, it is recommended that you prepare a squad and get them training at some point. 
Here you can create squads, fill their positions, assign equipment and schedules, and give specific orders.
This is the squad menu. 
Squads
Officers may opt for physical punishment if they cannot carry out custodial sentences.
It is recommended to place a certain number of [C:6:0:0]Cages[C:7:0:0] and [C:6:0:0]Chains[C:7:0:0] and assign them to a [C:3:0:0]Dungeon[C:7:0:0] zone. 
This is particularly important for schemes where the witnesses might not have the full story.
You can also interrogate suspects. 
All available witness information is presented for each case. 
It's up to you to choose whom to convict. 
Certain crimes are indicative of larger problems, so you should pay attention to them, and affected victims and family members get upset if crime is ignored.
If you have a law enforcement administrator like a [C:5:0:0]Sheriff[C:7:0:0] or [C:5:0:0]Captain of the Guard[C:7:0:0], witnesses of crimes will make reports, which find their way here.

The [C:6:0:0]Carpenter's Workshop[C:7:0:0] is the best place to make lightweight [C:6:0:1]Bins[C:7:0:0] and [C:6:0:1]Barrels[C:7:0:0], but they can also be made at 
(and some other things like [C:6:0:1]Sand[C:7:0:0]).  [C:6:0:1]Bins[C:7:0:0] hold just about everything else except [C:6:0:1]Furniture[C:7:0:0], [C:6:0:1]Wood[C:7:0:0] and [C:6:0:1]Boulders[C:7:0:0]. 
[C:6:0:1]Barrels[C:7:0:0], and [C:6:0:1]Bags[C:7:0:0].  [C:6:0:1]Barrels[C:7:0:0] are used to store [C:6:0:1]Food[C:7:0:0].  [C:6:0:1]Bags[C:7:0:0] are used to store [C:6:0:1]Seeds[C:7:0:0] 
If you find that your stockpiles are filling up too fast, you can create room by building [C:6:0:1]Bins[C:7:0:0], 
The system is reasonably powerful and you can eventually automate almost all of your production if you wish.
You can also create work orders at specific [C:6:0:0]Workshops[C:7:0:0] from their building sheet. 
You can limit work orders to a number of [C:6:0:0]Workshops[C:7:0:0]. 
For instance, you can create an order to [C:3:0:1]Make Wooden Bins[C:7:0:0] if you are out of empty ones, to [C:3:0:1]Brew Drinks[C:7:0:0] if you are running low, or to [C:3:0:1]Make Five Statues[C:7:0:0] every month.
These work orders are set to complete a certain number of [C:3:0:1]Tasks[C:7:0:0] and can be given start conditions.
Work orders are used to automate [C:3:0:1]Tasks[C:7:0:0] in [C:6:0:0]Workshops[C:7:0:0]. 
Raids are created by clicking on any site not belonging to your civilization.
You can also cause trouble if you'd like to raid your neighbors.

While it is possible to trade for [C:6:0:1]Clothing[C:7:0:0], [C:6:0:1]Cloth[C:7:0:0], or [C:6:0:1]Leather[C:7:0:0], you can also farm [C:6:0:1]Pigtails[C:7:0:0], 
Eventually the [C:6:0:1]Clothing[C:7:0:0] that your residents start with will rot away. 
Repeat this pattern until you get below the aquifer.
You can then build [C:6:0:0]Walls[C:7:0:0] around the stairs until the leaking water is blocked off. 
One way is to simply re-designate the damp stone for mining in order to build a 3x3 room around the stairs. 
Aquifers can block the downward progress of your fortress, but it is possible to bypass them.

There are five types of [C:1:0:1]Locations[C:7:0:0], which we'll go over in turn.
[C:3:0:0]Zones[C:7:0:0] can be assigned to special [C:1:0:1]Locations[C:7:0:0]. Usually one [C:3:0:0]Meeting Area[C:7:0:0] is sufficient, but [C:1:0:1]Locations[C:7:0:0] can span several [C:3:0:0]Zones[C:7:0:0]. 
[C:3:0:0]Meeting Areas[C:7:0:0] are [C:3:0:0]Zones[C:7:0:0] where your citizens gather when not working or taking care of their needs. 
[C:6:0:1]Skins[C:7:0:0] are tanned at the [C:6:0:0]Tanner's Shop[C:7:0:0], and made into [C:6:0:1]Clothing[C:7:0:0] at the [C:6:0:0]Leather Works[C:7:0:0].

You can also set whether a party member will be controlled manually during tactical mode, or whether they'll be controlled by the computer.

You can climb trees.  First you must establish a hold with a free grasp.  Then you can continue to move up into the air, while maintaining a hold on an adjacent tile.  
This is the hold and climb menu.
Continue moving in the same direction to build up speed.  If you or your mount are moving quickly, your attacks gain velocity.  
If a gait has two numbers, the first number is the starting speed for the gait, and the second is the maximum speed.  
Moving quickly costs energy.  You'll begin to move slowly or even collapse if you sprint for too long.  
This is the movement options menu.  Here you can choose your gait and see your current stealth profile.  
If you are carrying too much, you'll see an encumbrance indicator above the inventory button.  Encumbrance can cause you to move very slowly and should be avoided if possible.  
Inventory items are all worn, held, in containers, or otherwise related to specific body parts.  There is no abstract inventory space.  
Here you can interact with the objects you are carrying.  Items can be dropped, worn, eaten, thrown, named, etc.  The icon tooltips describe your options for each item.

This is the butchering and crafting menu.
Compositions take more time, and you'll pass through a period of time similar to sleeping, resting, and traveling.  
Performance occur over a period of time related to the specific art form or piece.  You can interrupt the performance as it unfolds, commit to finishing it and wait for its completion, or continue in steps.

This is the performance menu.  Here you can initiate a poetry recital, tell a story, dance, sing, or play a musical instrument.

There are many conversation options.  Important ones to note at first are inquiring about troubles, which might set you on the road to adventure, 
When speaking to somebody, you'll choose what to say, and then time will pass while you are speaking and waiting for a reply.  
Conversations occur over time, like movements and attacks.  
This is the conversation menu.
Talk
The hold menu also allows you to lead and mount pets.  You can claim stray animals as pets here too.  To name your new pets, use the talk menu.  
You can jump while climbing, and you can also release your hold.  In these ways, you might reach areas you can't otherwise reach.  
Some surfaces like walls can be also climbed, but these require climbing skill to hold reliably.  
Wrestle
For this reason, it's important to obtain better equipment when you can.  
Skill and item quality can help with this, but sometimes it's just not possible to damage a target material with a weaker material.  
Once a strike hits, the materials and velocity are used to determine the damage.  
However, skill is the most important determiner of hits versus misses.  
There is a random element to outcomes and some body parts will be easier or harder to hit from moment to moment.  
Attacks target specific body parts and have various modifiers.  You will select these in the subsequent menus.  
This is the attack menu.  Here you can strike creatures with an item or body part, or you can initiate a dodge or parry movement.  
If you obtain any magical powers during your adventure, you will find them in this menu.  
Some abilities, like the flight of winged creatures, can just be used during regular movement without needing this menu. 
Any ability you possess that doesn't fit elsewhere will appear here.  For instance, many creatures can spit or pet animals.  Others can breathe fire.  
This is the abilities menu.
Crafting in the base game is limited to constructing a stone axe necessary to fell trees.  You can pick up few rocks and a tree branch to get started.  
Butchering requires a sharp-edged weapon or tool, as well as a butcherable carcass.  Butchering is an excellent source of meat.  The other products cannot currently be used.  
You can stop traveling using the stop travel button below or by pressing .
You are also still subject to attack or ambush, though you can see certain groups on the map and may be able to avoid them.  
Here you can travel great distances without having to move in the local mode.  You still become thirsty, hungry, and drowsy while traveling.  
This is travel mode.

Be warned that shooting a projectile currently has a long recovery time, so you may be subject to attack after you fire.  
] from play.
You can initiate throwing from the inventory menu, or by pressing 
This is the projectile aiming menu.  You can shoot projectiles with a launcher like a bow or crossbow, and you can throw almost any object that you are carrying in a grasp.  
Unless you are very skilled, you should not attempt to wrestle larger creatures, and you should try to avoid being grabbed by them.  
Relative body size is the most important determiner of wrestling outcomes.  A character's wrestling skill is also important.  
You can grab creatures with your grasps and limbs, and both the target and attacking part determine which wrestling moves are available.  
Wrestling involves specific attacking body parts and specific target body parts.  
This is the wrestling menu.  Here you can grab creatures and then execute a variety of wrestling moves.  You can also initiate defensive actions here.  
It's also generally wise to try to sleep in friendly places, but you might need to obtain permission. 
If you have multiple party members, your chances of being ambushed will be greatly reduced.  
This is the sleep menu.  Here you can sleep to overcome drowsiness or wait to pass time.

Not enough memory or resources.
Reached maximum audible playback count for this sound's soundgroup.
Tried to call a command on a 2d sound when the command was meant for 3d sound.

Couldn't connect to the specified host.
Tried to use a feature that requires hardware support.
The specified URL couldn't be resolved.
A socket error occurred.  This is a catch-all for socket-related errors not listed elsewhere.
Operation could not be performed because specified sound/DSP connection is not ready.
Operation on a non-blocking socket could not complete immediately.
Error creating hardware sound buffer.
Error initializing output device, but more specifically, the output device is already in use and cannot be reused.
Soundcard does not support the specified format.
A call to a standard soundcard driver failed, which could possibly mean a bug in the driver or resources were missing or exhausted.
The output device has no drivers installed.  If pre-init, FMOD_OUTPUT_NOSOUND is selected as the output mode.  If post-init, the function just fails.
Error initializing output device.
A requested output, dsp unit type or codec was not available.
An unspecified error has been returned from a plugin.
A plugin was built with an unsupported SDK version.
A resource that the plugin requires cannot be allocated or found. (ie the DLS file for MIDI playback)
Reverb properties cannot be set on this channel because a parent channelgroup owns the reverb connection.
An error occurred trying to initialize the recording device.
The error occurred because the sound referenced contains subsounds when it shouldn't have, or it doesn't contain subsounds when it should have.  The operation may also not be able to be performed on a parent sound.
Specified instance in FMOD_REVERB_PROPERTIES couldn't be set. Most likely because it is an invalid instance number or the reverb doesn't exist.
Shared subsounds cannot be replaced or moved from their parent stream, such as when the parent stream is an FSB file.
This subsound is already being used by another sound, you cannot have more than one parent to a sound.  Null out the other parent's entry first.
The sound created exceeds the allowable input channel count.  This can be increased using the 'maxinputchannels' parameter in System::setSoftwareFormat.
The specified tag could not be found or there are no tags.
Something in FMOD hasn't been implemented when it should be! contact support!
The retrieved string is too long to fit in the supplied buffer and has been truncated.
DMA Failure.  See debug output for more information.
The specified channel has been reused to play another sound.
DSP return code from a DSP process query callback.  Tells mixer not to call the process callback and therefore not consume CPU.  Use this to optimize the DSP graph.
DSP connection error.  Connection possibly caused a cyclic dependency or connected dsps with incompatible buffer counts.
DSP is already in the mixer's DSP network. It must be removed before being reinserted or released.
DSP Format error.  A DSP unit may have attempted to connect to this network with the wrong format, or a matrix may have been set with the wrong size if the target unit has a specified channel map.
DSP operation error.  Cannot perform operation on this DSP as it is reserved by the system.
DSP connection error.  Couldn't find the DSP unit specified.
DSP operation cannot be performed on a DSP of this type.
DSP return code from a DSP process query callback.  Tells mixer silence would be produced from read, so go idle and not consume CPU.  Use this to optimize the DSP graph.
Couldn't perform seek operation.  This is a limitation of the medium (ie netstreams) or the file format.

Everything is so much easier when you just tell the truth.
There is no value in telling the truth thoughtlessly.  Consider the circumstances and say what is best.
Is there ever a time when honesty by itself overrides other considerations?  Say what is right, not what is true.
Don't think about the truth, whatever that is.  Just say what needs to be said.
It is abhorrent to seek power over other people.
The struggle for power must be balanced by other considerations.
You should always tell the truth.
There is nothing so important that it is worth telling a lie.
Strive for power.
Power over others is the only true measure of worth.
You can be powerful or powerless.  The choice is yours, until somebody makes it for you.
There's nothing admirable about bullying others.
Be careful of your so-called friends.
Friends are future enemies.  I don't see the difference.  People do as they must.
Building friendships is a waste.  There is no bond that can withstand distance or a change of circumstance.
Friends are nice, but you should keep your priorities straight.
Don't be afraid to do anything to get ahead in this world.
Life isn't fair, and sometimes you have to do what you have to do, but working toward a balance isn't a bad thing.
Please maintain your dignity.
What do you care how I speak or how I live?
Who are these mealy-mouthed cowards trying to impress?
They are so full of all those big words.
There is a time for artful speech, and a time for blunt speech as well.
Always deal fairly.
There's no value in all of this scheming I see these days.
Be shrewd, but do not lose yourself in guile.
I do admire a clever turn of phrase.
I can appreciate the right turn of phrase.
There are times when it is alright not to tell the whole truth.
It is best not to complicate your life with lies, sure, but the truth also has its problems.
Sometimes the blunt truth just does more damage.  Think about how the situation will unfold before you speak.
I do admire a clever trap.
You must never forget true loyalty.  Repay it in full.
How can society function without loyalty?  We must be able to have faith in each other.
One must always be loyal to their cause and the ones they serve.
Don't serve anyone blindly.  You'll only get into trouble.
No law can do justice to the complexity of life.
Some laws are just, while others were made to be broken.
Rules are there to be bent, but they shouldn't be flouted thoughtlessly.
I consider laws to be more of a suggestion than anything.
I don't know 
One should always respect the law.
Society flourishes when law breakers are punished.
Nothing gives them the right to establish these laws.
a very loyal soldier
.  What happened to bring us to this?
 my neighbor.
You can't always rely on your family, but it's good to know somebody is there.
There's nothing like a good friend.
Surround yourself with friends you can trust and you will be unstoppable.
When all other bonds wither, friendship will remain.
I was always irritated by family.
We cannot choose our families, but we can choose to avoid them.
I hold the relationships I've forged myself over family ties I had no part in creating.
Family is complicated and those ties be both a boon and a curse.  Sometimes both at once!
Consider your loyalties carefully, adhere to them while they last, and abandon them when you must.
How great it is to be surrounded by family!
You can always rely on your family when everything else falls away.
Family is the true bond that keeps society thriving.
The whole idea of loyalty is pointless.  Acting purely out of loyalty implies acting against one's own best interest.
Never lose yourself in loyalty.  You know what is best for yourself.
Loyalty has value, but you should always keep the broader picture in mind.
You should only maintain loyalty so long as something more important is not at stake.
Why this obsession with weapons and battle?  I don't understand some people.
The world isn't always safe.  I can see the value in martial training, the beauty even, but it shouldn't be exalted.
We should all be so lucky as to truly master a skill.
The amount of practice that goes into mastering a skill is so impressive.
An artisan, their materials and the tools to shape them!
Masterwork?  Why should I care?
A tool should get the job done, but one shouldn't obsess over the details.
A skilled warrior is a beautiful sight to behold.
It's great when we all get a chance to be merry together.
Bah!  I hope you aren't celebrating something.
Merriment is worthless.
I can take or leave merrymaking myself, but I don't begrudge people their enjoyment.
We should all be as one.  Why all the struggling?
We grow through debate and struggle, even chaos and discord.
Some discord is a healthy part of society, but we must also try to live together.
Be merry!
Hard work is great.  Finding a way to work half as hard is even better.
We must be ready to sacrifice when the time comes.
Why harm yourself for anybody else's benefit?
Some self-sacrifice is worthy, but do not forget yourself in devotion to the well-being of others.
You shouldn't whittle your life away on working.
Hard work is bested by luck, connections and wealth every time.
An earnest effort at any required tasks.  That's all that's needed.
I only work so hard, but sometimes you have to do what you have to do.
In life, you should work hard.  Then work harder.
Hard work is the true sign of character.
The best way to get what you want out of life is to work for it.
It's foolish to work hard for anything.
Everyone should broaden their horizons.  Any work beyond learning the basics is just a waste.
All of that practice is misspent effort.
I think people should hone their skills, but it's possible to take it too far and lose sight of the breadth of life.
There's more to life than becoming great at just one thing, but being good at several isn't bad!
It's better to work alone when possible, I think.  Cooperation breeds weakness.
You should think carefully before embarking on a joint enterprise, though there is some value in working together.
I treasure my freedom.
Nobody is free, and it is pointless to act as if you are.
What's so special about art?
Art?  More like wasted opportunity.
Art is complicated.  I know what I like, but some I can do without.
We should all work together.
We need to move beyond traditions.
Some traditions are worth keeping, but we should consider their overall value.
Art is life.
The creative impulse is so valuable.
I can see a place for maintaining decorum, but it's exhausting to live that way.
Some things should never change.
It's admirable when the traditions are upheld.
We need to find a better way than those of before.
People should be able to control themselves, but it's fine to follow impulses that aren't too harmful.
The mind thinks best when the world is at rest.
Give me the bustle and noise over all that quiet!
I like a balance of tranquility and commotion myself.
Why would I waste time thinking about myself?
Some time spent in reflection is admirable, but you must not forget to live your life.
I think self-control is key.  Master yourself.
Why deny yourself your heart's desire?
The quest for knowledge never ends.
All of that so-called knowledge doesn't mean a thing.
Knowledge can be useful, but it can also be pointless or even dangerous.
It is important to discover yourself.
Personal freedom must be tempered by other considerations.
One should not complain or betray any feeling.
Do not hide yourself behind an unfeeling mask.
There are times when it is best to keep your feelings to yourself, but I wouldn't want to force it.
People can be so angry, and I just don't understand it.
W... worried?  Do I look worried?
There's nothing to be upset about.
I'm feeling randy today!
Is there something to be happy about?
It really gets me down sometimes.
How can people be so glum?
I have trouble controlling my temper.
How can someone be so consumed by hate?
I get so jealous sometimes.
I don't understand how somebody can become so obsessed by what somebody else has.
Be happy!
the theme of 
It's a great day to fall in love all over again.
People do get so carried away sometimes, but not I.
Sometimes I just don't like somebody.
Maybe I give up too early sometimes.
I don't always do things in the most efficient way.
We must be careful not to waste.
I don't mind stirring things up.
I am not governed by urges.
There's nothing like a good brawl.
Why must they be so violent?
Get me going and I won't stop for anything.
Why are they so fixated on these baubles?
I could really use a drink.
So I overindulge sometimes.
Sometimes I think I need a drink, but I can control myself.
I just don't understand these flames of passion people go on about.
I don't handle pressure well.
I'm at my best under pressure.
Yes, I want more.  Is that so bad?
All of this buying and selling isn't honest work.
There's something to be said for trade as a necessity, but there are better things in life to do with one's time.
There's nothing like a great romance!
These people carrying on about romance should be more practical.
There's work to be done!
Time spent in leisure is such a waste.
There's some value in leisure, but one also has to engage with other aspects of life.
Trade is the life-blood of a thriving society.
Anybody that sticks to something a moment longer than they have to is an idiot.
It's good to keep pushing forward, but sometimes you just have to know when it's time to stop.
Wouldn't it be grand to just take my life off and do nothing for the rest of my days?
It's best to slow down and just relax.
It's a competitive world, and you'd be a fool to think otherwise.
All of this striving against one another is so foolish.
There is value in a good rivalry, but such danger as well.
Keep going and never quit.

Let there be peace throughout the world.
How I long for the beautiful spectacle of war!
War is sometimes necessary, but peace must be valued as well, when we can have it.
Uhh...
You shouldn't get too carried away with romance, but it's fine in moderation.
It's wonderful to be out exploring the wilds!
I could do without all of those creatures and that tangled greenery.
Nature can be enjoyed and used for myriad purposes, but there must always be respect and even fear of its power.
I don't really get attached to people.
I go with the flow sometimes.
Don't bother trying to play on my emotions.
I'm happy to help.
Try to keep an open mind.
Everybody has their own way of life.
I don't understand why they have to be that way.
Friendship is forever.
I could tell you all about it!
If you have a task, do it properly.
It's not perfect, but it's good enough.  Why fret about it?
I'm not going to change my mind.
I don't really want to know.
I wonder what they think.
Who cares what they think?
I don't feel like telling you about it.
I try not to interrupt.
There's so much to be done!
What's the rush?
I need some more excitement in my life.
My trust is earned, and not by many.
It's such a joy to be with people.
I prefer to be by myself.
People should listen to what I have to say.
One must always carefully consider the correct course of action.
Everything just so in its proper place!
It's my mess.
People are basically trustworthy.
Why should I help?
Do your duty.
I don't like being obligated to anybody.
Oh, I don't usually think much.
Some people are so wrapped up in themselves.
My goals are important to me.
I don't feel like I need to chase anything.
One should always return a favor.
Bravery is not a strength of mine.
We will be successful.
I don't think I'm cut out for this.
I look splendid today.
What's this about proper living?
I was never one to follow advice.
I'm not much of a decision maker.
Have no fear.
It's so great when everybody just gets along.
You're so perceptive!
You don't care, so don't ask.
I try to live and behave properly.
Huh?  What was that?
I'm feeling optimistic about the future.
It won't turn out well.
I'm curious.  Tell me everything!
Oh, I'm nothing special.
There's no room for mercy in this world.
Show some mercy now and again.
I'm concentrating on something.
That isn't funny.
Don't get on my bad side.
You shouldn't waste your life on revenge.
I am a very, very important person.
It's not a gift if you expect something in return.
I like to dress well.
I wouldn't feel comfortable getting all dressed up.
Did you hear the one about the 
What's that?!
The horror consumes me!
I cannot be overwhelmed by grief!
Fantastic!
What is the meaning of it all?!
I can't believe how great I feel!
That's incredibly suspicious!
What's going on?!
Such sweet bliss!
Every last one of you will pay with your lives!
Ahhhhhhh!  No!
Eek!
The pain!
How incredibly satisfying!
Oh joyous occasion!
The love overwhelms me!
Such adoration I feel!
How affectionate I am!
How agitating!
This is so aggravating!
I will take revenge!
I must press on!
I am in complete accord with this!
How admirable!
That was very satisfying!
I am so happy!
I feel such love!
How blissful!
I am so enraged!
Yes!  It is done.
I must not succumb to fear!
I feel such unbearable sadness...
I feel angry all the time.
I'm feeling really worn down.
It's all starting to get me down.
I've been feeling anxious.
I'm feel like I'm about to snap.
I just don't care anymore...
I feel so tired of everything.
I can't take much more of this!
A great piece of art is one that moves me.
I guess I just don't appreciate art.
I cannot stand the world any longer...
Everything is all piling up at once!
I'd just as soon not have anything too exciting happen today.
Do you have dreams?  Tell me a story!
Try to focus on the practical side of the matter.
I encountered a fascinating conundrum recently.
Ah...  uh...
The horror...
Rawr!!!
Waaaaa...
I feel 
just fine

I get fed up sometimes.
I've been under some pressure.
I'm doing 
Such freedom I feel!
Such a fright!
How frustrating!
Glee!
So exasperating!
How exhilarating!
You will know my ferocity!
I'm feeling so fond!
How embarrassing!
I feel such empathy!
I feel so empty inside...
How enjoyable!
I am very, very displeased.
What shall I do?  This is a disaster!
I can't wait to get to it!
Such elation I feel!
How incredibly interesting!
How irritating!
I feel so isolated!
Such a jolly time!
I am filled with such hope!
There is no hope!
The humiliation!
Such an offense!
Not that it's your business!  Harumph!
The guilt is almost unbearable!
Such happiness!
I am consumed by hatred.
The gloom blankets me...
How glum I am...
I am so grateful!
It makes me so grouchy!
I'm so anxious!
I could not care less.
I am very aroused!
Astonishing!
It's annoying.
I'm annoyed.
That's annoying.
So annoying!
Ha ha!  So amusing!
I am so angry!
The anguish is overwhelming...
How annoying!
The agony is too much!
I feel so alienated...
Wow!  That's amazing!
I am so torn over this...
How disgusting!
How naive I was...  this strikes me to the core.
I feel such an intense dislike...
Everything is coming apart!
I feel so dejected...
How very delightful!
I despair at this!
My disappointment is palpable!
I care so much!
I'm so incredibly confused...
I can't describe the contempt I feel...
I am so content about this.
I really need to get away from this.
I'm awe-struck!
I'm terribly bitter about this...
This is so boring!
I feel so good!
Such gaiety!
This is so exciting!
That's suspicious!
I know it will come to pass!
I am wracked by doubts!
Let's go!
This cannot possibly end well...
I am filled with such wrath!
Nothing shall stand in my way!
What am I even doing here?
I feel so defeated...
I feel so uneasy!
Such unhappiness!
The wonder!
I'm so worried!
How blissful I am.
I will have my revenge.
I am not scared!
I accept this.
I cannot give in to sadness.
I am very satisfied.
This is a joyous time.
This is love.
This is great!
I am about to lose it!
Begone fear!
That's alarming!
Most shocking!
This is truly horrifying.
I am almost overcome by grief.
My patience is as the still waters.
I burn with such passion!
How pleasurable!
I am so proud!
Such nostalgia!
My optimism is unshakeable!
This is such an outrage!
I'm panicking!  I'm panicking!
I'm overcome by lust!
Such misery!
The mortification overwhelms me!
I am so nervous!
How jovial I feel!
Such jubilation I feel!
I crawl with such unbearable loathing!
I'm so terribly lonely!
I am so ashamed!
I feel such sympathy!
The tenderness I feel!
It's so thrilling!
I have been so wronged!
Why does it keep happening to me?  Why me?!
I live to serve...  my dear master...
I can't take it!
I feel such remorse!
I repent!  I repent!
I am overcome by such resentment...
I feel so restless!
Such total rapture!
Such rejection!  I cannot stand it.
Such a relief!
I have so many regrets...
I'm very fond.
I feel so free.
That was so frightful.
This is very frustrating.
I really enjoyed that!
I'm quite exasperated.
That was very exhilarating!
I'm feeling so ferocious!
I'm so elated.
This is so embarrassing...
I'm very empathetic.
I feel such emptiness.
It has all gone wrong!
This is quite displeasing.
I'm so distressed about this!
I'm very eager to get started.
I am very insulted.
It's very interesting.
I'm very irritated by this.
I feel very isolated.
The hate burns within me.
I am very hopeful.
I feel hopeless.
This is so humiliating.
It makes me very grouchy.
Harumph!
I feel so guilty.
I am so happy.
I'm so gleeful.
It makes me so gloomy.
I feel so glum.
I'm very grateful.
That's very annoying.
It makes me very anxious.
It would be hard to care less.
I'm aroused!
I have strong feelings of ambivalence.
That's very amusing.
I'm very angry.
I feel so anguished...
I'm very aggravated.
The agony I feel...
I feel alienated.
I admire this.
I adore this.
I'm feeling affectionate.
This is driving me to agitation.
I am very disappointed.
So disgusting...
I've become so disillusioned.  What now?
I really don't like this.
I'm very content.
I'm feeling very dejected.
This is delightful!
I feel such despair...
It's really boring.
I really care.
I'm so confused.
Contemptible!
It's quite astonishing.
I'm very averse to this.
Awe-inspiring...
It makes me very bitter.
I really don't see this working out.
I'm feeling great!
The gaiety I'm feeling!
This is really exciting!
I've been defeated.
Things are going to happen.
I'm very doubtful.
I feel enthusiastic!
I'm very worried.
I am wrathful.
I shall accomplish much!
What is the meaning of life...
This is quite a thrill!
I feel very uneasy.
I'm very unhappy.
I am filled with wonder.
Is this love?
This could be bliss.
This might require an answer.
I feel no terror.
This doesn't scare me.
I feel somewhat sad.
That was satisfying.
This is nice.
I must let grief pass me by.
I feel like a victor.
I'm a little angry.
It has come to pass.
How suspicious...
That was alarming.
I will master myself.
This cannot horrify me.
I'm really starting to panic.
I'm very patient.
I feel such passion.
I'm very pleased.
I'm very nervous.

I feel so much loathing...
This leaves me so shaken.
I feel such shame.
I'm very sympathetic.
I feel such tenderness.

I must repent.
I'm very resentful.
I am very proud.
I am so spiritually moved!

I take offense.
It's interesting.
It's irritating.
I feel isolated.
I feel hate.
I have hope.
I cannot find hope.
This is humiliating.
I'm a little grouchy.
Harumph.
I feel guilty.
I'm happy.
There's some glee here!
I'm a little gloomy.
I'm glum.
I'm grateful.
I'm anguished.
I'm anxious.
Who cares?
Arousing...
That is amazing.
I'm ambivalent.
Amusing.
That makes me angry.
This is agitating.
This is aggravating.
This is agonizing.
I feel somewhat alienated.
I can accept this.
I find this somewhat admirable.

That's disgusting.
This makes me question it all.
I dislike this.
I'm content.
I'm dejected.
I feel some delight.
I feel despair.
It's boring.
I care.
This is confusing.
I feel only contempt.
It's astonishing, really.
I'd like to get away from it.
It fills one with awe.
It makes me bitter.
I feel pretty good.
This is gaiety.
I'm excited.
Takes all kinds these days.
It could happen!
I have my doubts.
Let's do this.
Things usually don't work out
It's worrisome.
The wrath rises within me...
I am ready for this.
I'm beat.
Thrilling.
I'm uneasy.
I'm unhappy.
It's wondrous.
I do not see the bliss in this.
There is no need to feel vengeful.
I laugh in the face of death!
I do not accept this.
I am not feeling sad right now.
That was not satisfying.
I suppose this would be a joyous occasion.
There is no love.
There is no need for celebration.
I have no feelings of rage.
I guess it could be considered grimly satisfying.
This does not scare me.
What is it this time...
That did not shock me.
I am not upset by this.
Grief?  I feel nothing.
I feel a little panic.
I'm patient.
I feel passion.
It pleases me.
I'm nervous.
I feel nostalgia.
I'm optimistic.
It is an outrage.
I'm lonely.

Why me?
I will serve.
I feel regret.
I feel remorse.
I repent of my deeds.
I feel resentful.
I'm proud.
My spirit moves.
I feel rejected.
I'm relieved.
I am not fond of this.
I don't feel free.
I guess that could have given me a fright.
This isn't frustrating.
I'm not enjoying this.
This isn't exasperating.
I am not exhilarated.
I should be feeling ferocious right now.
I'm not elated.
This isn't embarrassing.
I don't feel very empathetic.
What's inside me isn't emptiness exactly...
I'm not dismayed.
I feel no displeasure.
This isn't distressing.
I am not eager.
That doesn't insult me.
No, I'm not interested.
This isn't irritating.
I don't feel isolated.

I don't feel guilty about it.
I am not happy.
I'm not gleeful.
I'm not feeling gloomy.
I don't feel glum.
I'm not feeling very grateful.
No, that's not annoying.
I'm not anxious.
If I thought about it more, I guess I'd be apathetic.
That is not in the least bit arousing.
I guess I should be feeling ambivalent right now.
That was not amusing.
I'm not angry.
This is nothing.
I'm not feeling aggravated.
I can take this.
I guess that would be alienating.
That wasn't amazing.
There's not much to admire here.
I suppose I should be feel adoration.
I'm not feeling very affectionate.
I don't feel agitated.
I'm not disappointed.
It'll take more than that to disgust me.
This won't make me lose faith.
I don't dislike that.
I am not contented.
There's nothing to be dejected about.
I am not filled with delight.
I will not despair.
It isn't boring.
I don't care.
This isn't confusing.
I don't feel contempt.
Astonished?  No.
I'm not averse to it.
I am not held in awe.
That's nothing to be bitter about.
There's no reason to be pessimistic.
I should be feeling great.
There is no gaiety.
This doesn't excite me.
This isn't a defeat.
I'm not expecting anything.
I have no doubts.
I'm just not enthusiastic.
I'm not worried.
Wrath has not risen within me.
I have no zeal for this.
I could be questioning my life right now.
There was no thrill in it.
I'm not uneasy.
That doesn't make me unhappy.
There is no sense of wonder.
I found myself dead.

Apocalypse!  We are being judged by the gods!
[C:VAR:MEETING:ACTOR][VAR:NATIVENAME:MEETING:ACTOR]:  I am your liaison from the Mountainhomes.  Let's discuss your situation.
elves_firstcontact1
[C:VAR:MEETING:ACTOR][VAR:NATIVENAME:MEETING:ACTOR]:  Farewell, [VAR:NATIVENAME:MEETING:NOBLE].  I look forward to our meeting next year.  Our fortunes rise and fall together.
dwarf_liaison1
[C:VAR:MEETING:ACTOR][VAR:NATIVENAME:MEETING:ACTOR]:  What a pleasant surprise!  Not a single tree here weeps from the abuses meted out with such ease by your people.  Joy!  The dwarves have turned a page, not that we would make paper.  A travesty!  Perhaps it is better said that the dwarves have turned over a new leaf, and the springtime for our two races has only just begun.
elves_standard_bye
[C:VAR:MEETING:ACTOR][VAR:NATIVENAME:MEETING:ACTOR]:  You have disrespected the trees in this area, but this is what we have come to expect from your stunted kind.  Further abuse cannot be tolerated.  Let this be a warning to you.
