'''Bushtits''' are a type of [[above ground]] [[vermin]] who inhabit [[temperate]] [[forest]]s. They may be captured in [[animal trap]]s and turned into [[pet]]s. All bushtits possess Legendary [[skill]] in [[Climber|climbing]].

Some dwarves [[Preferences|like]] bushtits for their ''small size'' and their ''twittering groups''.
