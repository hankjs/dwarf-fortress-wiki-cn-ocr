'''Giant rats''' are [[creature]]s found at the first two layers of the [[caverns]] and the largest counterpart of the common [[rat]], being 8 times bigger than a [[large rat]] and 3 times bigger than a [[dwarf]]. These oversized rodents will come to your fortress and attempt to [[Steals food|steal your food]] and [[Steals drink|drink your alcohol]], and so should be kept away from your [[food]] [[stockpile]]s. All giant rats are born with Legendary [[skill]] in [[Climber|climbing]], and their infants are called ''giant rat pups''.

While large and unusual in size, giant rats are benign and will not start fights on their own. However, due to their thieving disposition, dwarves will react aggressively to their presence and often attack them on sight. Caution should be taken if a giant rat enters a populated area, as they can cause significant damage in the event that they fight back. Giant rats are exotic [[mount]]s and may be ridden by [[goblin]]s during [[siege]]s.

Due to their thieving behavior, giant rats are easily lured into [[trap]]s by using food stockpiles as bait. If captured in [[cage]]s, they can be [[Animal trainer|trained]] into valuable [[pet]]s (being as valuable as above-ground [[savage]] giants). However, due to their short lifespan, giant rats make poor long-term companions to dwarves and are better off being sold away or [[butcher]]ed for a nice amount of returns. Products made from giant rat parts are worth twice more than those made from common domestic animals. 

Some dwarves [[Preferences|like]] giant rats for their ''strength''.

<!-- Reference: short video made by Jerma985 Featuring a song sung by rats including “a giant rat that makes all of da rules”-->
Notable among giant creatures, singular Giant Rats may join groups of regular rats. Such Giant Rats become the leaders of their groups, dictating all of the rules.

Despite some humans thinking they don't exist, Giant Rats undoubtedly do. They however aren't restricted to [[magma]] swamps.
