[[File:item_quality_preview.png|right]]'''Quality''' is - by definition - the standard of something as measured against other things of a similar kind; the degree of excellence of something. Within the world(s) of ''Dwarf Fortress'', the primary factors of the quality of something are determined by the skill of the creator, as well as the materials used to make it. Quality also determines an object's financial value, and can strongly dictate someone's reception of said object when using it.

The value of some goods can be further improved by other means. For example, some goods can be encrusted with [[gem]]s, and [[clay]] goods can be glazed with [[ash]].

== Quality grades ==
All crafted items (e.g. [[furniture]], [[armor]], [[clothing|clothes]] and [[Kitchen#Types_of_meals|prepared meals]], but not [[drink]]s) have quality levels. If the quality of their craftsdwarfship is above-standard, the item name is bracketed by special symbols that reflect that quality (see table below). [[Coin]]s are an unusual case; the image on the coin may have a quality level, but this does not affect the value of the coin, and the coin's quality level is not shown by special characters. 

Item quality depends on the [[skill]] and [[attributes]] of the crafter. Past a certain high skill level a dwarf will almost always make at least ≡exceptional≡ quality items. ☼Masterworks☼ are capped to a maximum 1/3 (33.3%) chance.

For named weapons that are not artifacts, see [[Weapon#Attachment|here]].

: '''Note:''' Items may also be surrounded by braces {}, which indicates the item is [[forbidden]], or parentheses (), which indicates the item came from off-site (i.e. it arrived as [[Goblinite]], was purchased in a trade, or was part of the original [[Embark#Supplies|embark supplies]]). See [[Item designations]] for a summary.

Images on floors or walls that are engraved by an [[engraver]] have quality levels, which can be seen by examining the engraving. Note that engraving values are calculated differently than crafted items (they still use pre-v50 values), and while a wall will appear to be engraved on all four sides, the only rooms that benefit from a wall engraving are those containing the square the engraver was standing on at the time of engraving. Keep this in mind if you want to improve a specific room or improve multiple rooms!

Raw materials used for crafting items (e.g. [[stone]]s, [[log]]s, [[bar]]s, [[thread]], [[dye]], [[food]]) have no quality levels, with the exception of [[cloth]] (see next). [[Block]]s, an intermediary building material, also lack quality levels, as do smoothed [[floor]] tiles, [[wall]]s, and carved [[fortification]]s.

==== Decorations and dyeing ====
Almost all [[decoration]]s have quality levels, too. An item of any quality (except [[artifact]]-level) can have a decoration of any quality. (Artifacts can't be decorated manually, but have inherent decorations depending on the materials used to make them.) The quality level of a decoration is shown by the same signs ('''-''', '''+''', '''*''', '''≡''', or '''☼''') just outside the double angle-brackets («,»). Thus, a *«+steel battle axe+»* is a +finely-crafted steel battle axe+ with *superior decorations* on it, while a «☼steel battle axe☼» is a ☼masterfully crafted steel battle axe☼ with «decorations» of standard (low) quality (i.e. no visible symbol). Each decoration imparts its flat bonus and multiplier, so high-quality decorations can quickly create extremely-valuable items, even if those items were low-quality to begin with.

Dyeing is considered a (type of) decoration with quality levels, as are [[glaze]]s, the latter having the additional effect of making an [[earthenware]] [[jug]] or [[pot]] waterproof and capable of holding liquid. For example, some [[rope reed]] thread may be +finely dyed+ with emerald dye. Dye can be applied to either thread or cloth, but not other, finished goods made of cloth. If thread is dyed, and then woven into cloth, the new cloth will retain both the dye and whatever quality level it had. The same is true for cloth made into clothes and other goods. However, unlike other improvements, their quality levels will be displayed on the base item itself, but only if there are no other visible improvements - for example, a piece of superior rope reed cloth with exceptional dimple dye will appear as ≡rope reed cloth≡, and a finely-crafted sock made from superior cave spider silk will appear as a *cave spider silk sock* (but will become a *«+cave spider silk cloth+»* once a low-quality ''visible'' decoration is added). The same thing happens with ingredients on prepared meals - a well-prepared mule tallow roast containing superiorly-minced ingredients will show up as a *mule tallow roast*.

==== Masterpiece ====
Rarely, a dwarf will produce an item that excels beyond normal expectations; this item is "masterfully crafted", and commonly referred to as a masterwork, or a masterpiece item. Masterpiece items are noticeably more valuable than any other quality, and masterpiece weapons boast an [[edge]] the equal of [[artifact]] equivalents in their sharpness. Aside from [[artifact]]s, masterworks are the optimal a fortress can achieve, and many mature fortresses can boast of masterwork items for every useful feature, in [[bedroom]]s, in their [[dining hall]]s, for their [[military]] weapons and armor, everywhere that "better" is helpful.  And special rules apply to them.

Destroying a ☼masterwork☼ item (e.g. by melting) may cause the dwarf who made it to get unhappy [[thought]]s. Allowing an engraved image on the floor to get [[water|wet]] (and thus [[mud]]dy) will allow vegetation to grow on it and destroy the image, and cause an unhappy thought if the image was masterwork.  The same is true for mining through a wall with a masterwork image on it. An unhappy thought can also happen if a [[thief]] steals a masterwork item. It also happens in the unusual case where a creature was shot with a masterwork crossbow bolt and the bolt gets stuck in the creature when they leave the map.{{verify|check to see if this was fixed in v50}} Eating a masterwork prepared meal will not cause an unhappy thought, similarly to dismantling a masterwork building. Having a masterwork building destroyed by a [[cave-in]] or [[building destroyer]], however, will.

If a dwarf has created many masterpieces in their lifetime, the loss of a single item will affect them proportionally less. This is especially fortunate, for example, in the case of masterpiece crossbow [[Bolt#Masterwork_bolts|crossbow bolts]] (which are made in multiples), but it applies to any- and everything else as well.

==== Adventure mode ====
In [[Adventure mode]], the quality of upper body clothes can be seen in portraits of some individuals, such as the created characters, the graphics reflecting the quality of the worn item. Before starting a game in Adventure mode, the player can choose any quality of wearable item (i.e. [[armor]]) for themselves, at the cost of points. In these character portraits, the quality of clothes and armor can be easily seen, as the piece of clothing will appear to be more lavishly decorated the higher the quality is. This can be seen in the example image below:

[[File:clothing_quality_preview.png|thumb|708px|center|From left to right, the quality levels of the human's coat (upper) and the dwarf's armor (lower) are standard, -well-crafted-, +finely-crafted+, *superior quality*, =exceptional=, ☼masterful☼ and artifact.]]

The player has the choice of choosing the quality of some clothing and weapons by clicking [[File:quality_increase_button.png|16px]] and [[File:quality_decrease_button.png|16px]], with higher qualities costing more points. Note that some articles of clothing will not show a unique graphic for every level of quality. A player can never choose "artifact" quality from the start.

== Quality levels of imported goods ==
The vast majority of goods brought by caravans, immigrants, visitors, and invaders are superior-quality or less. Exceptional or masterwork-quality items are extremely rare. As a result, you can eventually make better-quality goods yourself, provided your dwarves are trained in the appropriate skill. This is important to keep in mind for your military, since the quality level of [[weapon]]s and [[armor]] can make a big difference in combat performance.

There are goods that you can't produce, that foreign civilizations can. Typically, these include uninteresting [[clothing]] items like skirts, or useless [[tool]]s like pestles, but also include some exotic weapons like [[whip]]s and [[dagger]]s. If you want to use those weapons, you have to settle for whatever is available, so it can take some time to find one made with decent quality and made from a good metal like [[iron]].

== Quality levels in stockpile settings ==
[[Stockpile]]s can be set to accept only goods of certain quality levels. However, the ''Core quality'' and the ''Total quality'' which can be set in a stockpile's settings are in a difficult relation to the crafting and decoration quality.

=== Core Quality ===
''Core quality'' means the quality of the ''craftsdwarfship of the item''. A masterfully crafted armor (made from qualityless metal bars) has masterful core quality. A finely-crafted dress (made from an exceptional pig tail fiber cloth) has fine core quality (because the craftsdwarfship ''of the item'' is fine).

=== Total Quality ===
''Total quality'' means the highest quality level between the craftsdwarfship of the item and the craftsdwarfship of its components (or decorations). The finely-crafted dress from our previous example has a fine core quality, but its total quality is exceptional because its component — a pig tail fiber cloth — is of exceptional quality. Likewise, a superior quality steel gauntlet, masterfully studded with copper is of masterful total quality (and superior core quality).

A more complex example: A rope reed fiber sock is superiorly decorated with pond turtle shell. Is masterfully crafted from a rope reed fiber cloth which was finely dyed with redroot dye. Core quality: masterful, Total quality: masterful. (Remember, for total quality, the best of either the item's quality, the quality of its components, or the quality of its decorations is chosen.)

==Admiring furniture==
Quality has an impact on the amount of [[thought|happiness]] a dwarf gets from admiring furniture only to the extent that it contributes to the furniture's [[value]]. That is, if there's a no-quality statue and a masterwork statue which have exactly the same monetary value, they'll each give the same amount of happiness when admired (assuming Urist has no [[Preferences|preference]] for the material of either statue). Furniture quality has no influence on how often a piece of furniture is admired.

==Changes to artifact weapons==
Toady gave us a [http://www.bay12forums.com/smf/index.php?topic=30026.msg1012311#msg1012311 quote] on weapon and armor quality, giving the game qualities of an "artifact" in v0.31:
<div style="width: 50em; padding: 0.5em; margin-bottom: 1em; border: 1px solid #ccc; background: #eee;">
#Additional value multiplier of 10 over masterwork, so a total multiplier of 120. 
#Cannot be owned (can be equipped, you might have to do it explicitly though).
#Armor deflection roll has ×3 roll modifier instead of the masterwork's ×2.
#Same for melee attack and archery rolls.
#It looks like the artifact edges are the maximum edge for the material, which is also what a masterwork gets, so beyond a masterwork you'd just be getting the hit roll modifier. *
#Things like artifact bone spears will likely be crap against steel, yeah. We don't have actual magical artifacts yet, and that's what would be required.
</div>
