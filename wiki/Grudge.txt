A '''grudge''' is a type of [[relationship]] a [[dwarf]] can have with another dwarf. The opposite of friendships, they tend to develop between dwarves of conflicting personality traits - sometimes, it is possible to have your starting dwarves form grudges even ''before'' they arrive at the new fortress location! Making a grudge causes an unhappy thought, but ironically, the death of a grudgee actually causes a bad thought as well.

==Mechanics==

It is currently unknown how a grudge is formed, but a dwarf that talks to another that they have a grudge with will generate an unhappy thought ("He was forced to talk to somebody annoying lately."). This is more likely to happen if you only have one [[meeting area]] or many jobless dwarves.

A grudge is more likely to form between dwarves with opposite ideals and/or personalities. An example would be between dwarf Mistem Okoluzul who formed a grudge with dwarf Adilina Kubukthiz. In examining their respective "Thoughts and Preferences" screens, we find an obvious clash:

'''- Adilina Kubukthiz:''' "''She is candid and sincere in dealings with others. She finds helping others very rewarding.''"<br>
'''- Mistem Okoluzul:''' "''He is often sad and dejected. He does not go out of his way to help others.''"

A personality clash is not necessarily a requirement to the forming of a grudge. Likewise, grudges are not always going to be mutual.{{cite forum|58158}}

Dwarves are well known for keeping grudges towards anyone who slights them, and keep note of their many grudges in a great [[book]] maintained by the [[monarch]]. [[Goblin]]s are by far the biggest offenders, and their names are listed in the great book many times. Once, a [[human]] [[noble]] hired dwarves to construct his [[castle]], but underpaid them by two [[Currency|dwarfbucks]], a slight which could not be ignored! And so they drowned the whole castle in [[magma]].
