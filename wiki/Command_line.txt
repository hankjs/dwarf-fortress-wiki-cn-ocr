The ''command line'' is used for quick [[advanced world generation]] from [[world_gen.txt|prefs/world_gen.txt]] through the [[wikipedia:cmd.exe|Windows command prompt]] or a [[wikipedia:Unix shell|Linux terminal window]].

Here is the text from "command line.txt":

Dwarf Fortress Command Line Options


Dwarf Fortress currently offers one command line option, a world generator, suggested by genmac.  You can use it as follows:

FORMAT:	"Dwarf Fortress.exe" -gen <id number> <seed> <world gen param title>
EXAMPLE:	"Dwarf Fortress.exe" -gen 1 3498 "MEDIUM ISLAND"
EXAMPLE:	"Dwarf Fortress.exe" -gen 2 RANDOM CUSTOM6

This will open a silent, introless dwarf fortress, generate a world with the given id number and seed, export the region files and a picture, and finally quit.  The window remains open so you can see what's going on.  You can still abort world generation while it is running.  If you attempt to create a world number that already exists, it will abort immediately.
</pre>

On Linux, make sure to rename the '''df''' shell script to something else before putting it in your path, since a '''df''' command already exists and replacing it with the ''Dwarf Fortress'' launcher script could mess up your system.

===Mods===
After the first gen, a default '''Dwarf Fortress/gen_modlist.txt''' will be created with an ordered list of vanilla mods ID, which will be used in all future gens.

===Example===
To generate '''32767''' maps on Windows create a file "generate.bat" in the game folder with this content and run.
