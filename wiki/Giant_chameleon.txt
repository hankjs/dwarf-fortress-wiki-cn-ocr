'''Giant chameleons''' are the [[giant animal]] versions of the [[chameleon]], found in a variety of [[savage]] biomes including [[desert]]s and [[tropical]] [[forest]]s. They are 1340 times larger than their [[vermin]] equivalents, or over 3 times the size of the average [[dwarf]]. Giant chameleons spawn one at a time, wandering through the biome and generally minding their own business. Due to their size, they can easily kill a civilian if provoked, but they should prove no big threat to a [[crossbow]]-wielding [[hunter]] or a [[military]] squad. All giant chameleons possess Legendary [[skill]] in [[Climber|climbing]].

Giant chameleons are tied with [[giant iguana]]s as the second best [[egg]]-layers of all giant creatures (losing only to the [[giant saltwater crocodile]]), a trait carried over from their vermin counterparts. They lay 40 to 50 eggs at a time, which makes them one of the best creatures for [[egg production]] in the game. They also possess the standard high [[pet]] value of all giant creatures, which makes them valuable pets.

Unlike most reptiles, which hatch as tiny compared to their adult forms, giant chameleons hatch as fully-grown adults. If you can acquire a breeding pair, then a single clutch of eggs can produce over 800 meat, making them ideal for the [[meat industry]] or unleashing scaly hordes upon [[goblin]] intruders, assuming the fortress survives the ensuing [[Catsplosion#Iguanasplosion|iguanasplosion]].

Some dwarves [[Preferences|like]] giant chameleons for their ''ability to change color'' and their ''eyes''.
