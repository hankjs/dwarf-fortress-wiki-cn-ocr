'''Mandrills''' are uncommon [[Creature|animals]] exclusively found in [[tropical]] moist broadleaf [[forest]]s, where they appear in loose groups of 5 to 10 mayhem-minded individuals. While famed in previous versions of the game for their great aggression (being particularly prominent in the story of [[Bloodline:Boatmurdered|Boatmurdered]]), mandrills in the current version typically won't go out of their way to attack [[Dwarf|dwarves]] and while they'll fight back if confronted, they're only a third of a dwarf's size and as such, even an unarmed peasant should be able to dispose of them, albeit after receiving some nasty bites and scratches. While not aggressive, mandrills are [[Thief|thieves]] and will eagerly steal both your [[Steals food|food]] and [[Steals items|items]] if given the chance, and as such should be left far away from your [[stockpile]]s. All mandrills are born with Legendary [[skill]] in [[Climber|climbing]].

Mandrills can be captured in [[cage]] [[trap]]s and [[Animal trainer|trained]] into exotic [[pet]]s. Due to their thieving disposition, food stockpiles surrounded by traps can be used as bait for them, and many can potentially be captured in a single spawn wave. They can receive further training and become war or hunting beasts, however due to being the second smallest war/hunting trainable creature in the game (losing only to the [[bobcat]]), they'll only truly be effective in large numbers. If [[butcher]]ed for a [[meat industry]], mandrills give a decent amount of returns. 

Despite their description, mandrill faces and rumps have the same color as the rest of their skin, never being blue. There exists a note from the developers in the raws to remind themselves to add these face colors.

Some dwarves [[Preferences|like]] mandrills for their ''colorful faces''.
