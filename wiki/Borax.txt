'''Borax''' is an unremarkable white stone which can be found in large quantities within [[rock salt]] and in small quantities within [[gypsum]].

Unlike in real life, Borax '''CANNOT''' be used as [[flux]] in game.

==Real life==
In real-life, borax is used as powder to either protect wood or is used as a [[flux]] while forging iron among many other uses (borax is a great aid for hot-forging two metals, for example it is needed to forge "damascus steel").

{{D for Dwarf}}

Some dwarves claim that borax "speaks for the stones".
