'''Pipes''', or '''pipe sections''', are used as components in the construction of [[screw pump|screw pumps]]. You can't build pipes by themselves in the current version, nor connect them to form a conduit - to move [[water]] or [[magma]] from one place to another, see [[aqueduct]].

Pipe sections can be manufactured from [[wood]] at a [[carpenter's workshop]], from [[metal]] at a [[metalsmith's forge]], or from [[glass]] at a [[glass furnace]]. A glass pipe section is listed as a "'''tube'''".  In workshops and [[stockpile]]s, pipes/tubes are listed under [[furniture]].

It takes 1 [[wood]] log or 3 [[metal]] bars or 1 [[sand]] to create a pipe section.
