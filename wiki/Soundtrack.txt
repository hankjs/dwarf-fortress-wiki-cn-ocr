The '''soundtrack''' for ''Dwarf Fortress'' [[premium version|Premium]] spans two albums, as well as a series of interludes.

==Development==
The Classic soundtrack for ''Dwarf Fortress'' was composed and played by the game's co-creator [[Toady One]]. The soundtrack consists of two flamenco-inspired[https://www.polygon.com/2014/7/24/5931277/download-the-dwarf-fortress-soundtrack-and-rock-out-in-ascii] compositions. Tabs for both compositions can be found in [[DF2014:Soundtrack]].

In 2022, the first ''Dwarf Fortress'' Premium edition OST was released. The main [[Bay 12 Games#Audio|composers and performers]] are Omar Dabbous, Simon Swerwer, and Águeda Macias. Swerwer has previously released original ''Dwarf Fortress''-inspired albums for [[SoundSense]]. With the launch of [[Release information/51.01|51.01]] in 2024, a new [[Adventurer mode]]-centered album was released.

A number of songs include lyrics in the [[Dwarven language]], such as Drink & Industry, Bruising The Fat ''(Shar Ikal)'', and Sisters of War, among others.

The Premium OST is dynamic, and the songs that play during games will depend on game context.
