'''Stoneworker''' is a category profession. Stoneworkers work with [[stone]] to produce [[furniture]], [[block|blocks]], and other goods. They can also work to [[smoothing|smooth]] rough stone and [[engraving|engrave]] images on it, to increase the [[stocks|value]] of the fortress.

An adult dwarf whose best skill is either [[engraver]] or [[mason]], and who has accumulated enough experience in the other skill (exactly how much is not clear), will be known as a stoneworker. Otherwise, the dwarf will be known by his or her higher skill. Graphically, stoneworkers will wear all white clothes.

The four Stoneworker skills are:

{{Skill Box|Stoneworker|7:1|7:1|
* [[Mason]]
* [[Stone carver]]
* [[Stonecutter]]
* [[Engraver]]}}
