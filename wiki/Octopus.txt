'''Octopuses''' (the correct in-game term) are a species of marine [[creature]] who may be found in any [[ocean]] [[biome]]. Only as large as a [[cat]], they are a negligible presence to [[dwarves]] and provide few returns when [[butcher]]ed. Unlike [[squid]]s, octopuses aren't [[vermin]] and can't be fished by [[Fisherdwarf|fisherdwarves]], but can be caught with the use of a [[drowning chamber]]. They possess [[copper]]-based blue [[blood]] instead of a usual dark red.

The most notable ability of the octopus is being able to squirt ink when threatened (or when controlled in the [[object testing arena|arena]] by clicking "Assume Control"). This has the effect of ''hiding'' the octopus from view (due to its [[interaction token]]), as well as preventing it from being viewed (clicked on) or listed in the {{menu icon|u}} units menu. Octopus ink turns water a dark grey, similar to other [[contaminant]]s. When controlling another creature in [[adventurer mode]], the {{dftext|You've spotted an octopus!|red}} message will appear, while in [[fortress mode]] you'll see {{dftext|An octopus has sprung from ambush!|red}} instead. Due to their tiny size, however, you shouldn't have to worry about it.

Some dwarves [[Preferences|like]] octopuses for their ''many arms'' and their ''intelligence''.
