'''Giant cougars''' are much [[Giant animal|larger]] versions of their [[cougar|smaller]] counterparts. They are roughly 10 times the size of a dwarf and standard cougar. Much like their standard-sized, smaller cousins, they also spawn in [[shrub]]- and woodlands, are solitary and rarely attack your dwarves. They can appear as exotic mounts in [[siege]]s. Despite being giant, the amount of [[meat]] they produce when is only slightly higher than their smaller counterparts when [[butcher|butchered]].

Some dwarves [[like]] giant cougars for their ''cunning''.
