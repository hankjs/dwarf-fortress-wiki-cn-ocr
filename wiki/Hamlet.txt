'''Hamlets''' ([[File:icon_site_village.png]]) are small [[site]]s built by [[human]]s, forming the rural areas of human civilizations. Populations in hamlets are low, and peak near one hundred residents, in contrast to [[town]]s; thus, hamlets are comparable to dwarven [[hillock]]s.

On the world map, {{Tile|æ|2:0}} and {{Tile|Æ|2:0}} indicate hamlets in [[hills]], while {{Tile|<nowiki>=</nowiki>|2:0}} and {{Tile|≡|2:0}} indicate hamlets in flat plains. {{Tile|Æ|1:0}}, {{Tile|Æ|1:1}} and {{Tile|Æ|3:1}} indicate hamlets situated on [[river]]s or streams. {{Tile|Æ|6:0}} are hamlets that have been abandoned or [[ruin|ruined]], though they don't display as this if they are on a river or stream.

Hamlets are composed of a [[mead hall]], a [[well]], groups of houses, and occasional small [[shrine]]s, all surrounded by immense fields of local [[crop]]s, meadows, and [[pasture]]s, with dirt [[road]]s running through the entire area. The mead hall houses the local governing body including the lord, other [[noble|nobility]], and [[hearthperson]]s, and is found near the edge of the hamlet. The well and houses are found near the center, usually by the side of a road. The houses often are inhabited by commoners, and may have a table and a cabinet containing leather clothing, but not beds. Bags containing the local crop plants may also be found in houses.

Adventurers may ask the inhabitants of buildings for permission to stay the night, and can lower and raise the bucket at a well with {{k|u}} to get water. [[Stray]] tamed animals can often be found wandering throughout the hamlet, that can be claimed as [[pet]]s, pack animals, or [[mount]]s, depending on the type of animal (or the larger ones can be killed and [[butcher]]ed for [[meat]] and [[bone]]s). Many of the plants in the surrounding fields can be {{k|g}}athered from, though not everything gathered will be edible, depending on the [[season]] and the adventurer's dietary needs.

In the rare case that a human civilization is [[civilization#Struggling|nearing death]] and all towns have been destroyed, a hamlet may become the seat of power, and the mead hall will be additionally used as the throne of the law-maker.
