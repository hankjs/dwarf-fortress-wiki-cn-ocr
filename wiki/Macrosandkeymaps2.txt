Playing ''Dwarf Fortress'' means lots of clicking and/or typing. The game has an internal macro/keymap system. Using it or any external program can save you a great deal of time when dumping, rewalling, designating, and so forth. In game settings you could toggle "Keyboard cursor enabled" to yes for macro mining designation. Unfortunately macros can only do keyboard inputs, meaning that with the v50 mouse/UI overhaul macros are far more limited than they used to be. Allegedly there are plans to reintroduce more keyboard controls, but that is not yet implemented. 

'''Remember that many of the features and techniques listed on this page have yet to be tested in v50 versions.''' 

== DF macros ==
=== Creating macros ===
The [[controls]] for creating macros within DF are as follows:

*{{k|Ctrl}}+{{k|r}} = record (the REC will be shown at top left of screen and {{k|Ctrl}}+{{k|r}} again to finish recording) 
*{{k|Ctrl}}+{{k|s}} = save (name the macro then {{k|Enter}})
*{{k|Ctrl}}+{{k|l}} = load 
*{{k|Ctrl}}+{{k|u}}+number = set to repeat [number] of times (maximum of 99) - Note that this seems to be broken as of v50.05
*{{k|Ctrl}}+{{k|p}} = play (the PLAY will be shown at top left of screen, repeat when hold, repeating macro will stop after the mouse cursor leaves the game screen)

To create a macro, press {{k|Ctrl}}+{{k|r}} to begin recording your actions.  When you have recorded all the actions that you want, stop recording by hitting {{k|Ctrl}}+{{k|r}} again and save ({{k|Ctrl}}+{{k|s}}) the macro.  The macro is then added to your macro list.  To load a macro from the list just press {{k|Ctrl}}+{{k|l}}. If you just recorded the macro, it is loaded even without saving. You can then play the macro by pressing {{k|Ctrl}}+{{k|p}} whenever you want.  You can also set a macro to repeat by pressing {{k|Ctrl}}+{{k|u}}, typing a two digit number, and then pressing {{k|Ctrl}}+{{k|p}} to begin the playback session.  Moving your mouse from the playing window, or otherwise losing focus on Dwarf Fortress, is an annoying way <s>a good way</s> to interrupt a macro session from continuing (also the only known method).

The macros are stored in the <code>[[Game folder|<Dwarf Fortress>]]/prefs/macros/</code> folder. The macros are saved in .mak format. The first line of the macro file must match the filename, or the file will not be recognized as a valid macro. Even a recorded file for a simple macro - for example to create a 3 tiles wide ramp - may already consist of up to 50 commands listed. This is because every possible [[Key_bindings|binding of the key pressed]] is included in the macro and put in a block (and {{k|r}} for ramp has many by default).
<pre>
pressing_enter_recorded
		SELECT
		CLOSE_MEGA_ANNOUNCEMENT
		WORLD_PARAM_ENTER_VALUE
		SETUPGAME_SAVE_PROFILE_GO
		D_BURROWS_DEFINE
		D_MILITARY_ALERTS_SET
	End of group
		CUSTOM_CTRL_R
	End of group
End of macro
</pre>
For this example the recording was started, enter was pressed and the recording was stopped. When using this macro every underlying command in the file will be called, if possible. If you are in the designation menu, it will react as a select, the other commands will be ignored. If you are in the burrow menu, it will work like pressing enter there. The macro alway ends with a block containing the end of its recording. But executing macros seems to ignore this command. If you have changed your key bindings you'll get another result, because the underlying commands are recorded, not the keys pressed.<br />
When creating or editing your own macros it is a good idea to use only those commands you really want.
<pre>
ramping_created
		DESIGNATE_RAMP
	End of group
		CURSOR_DOWN_Z
	End of group
		SELECT
	End of group
		CURSOR_RIGHT
	End of group
		CURSOR_RIGHT
	End of group
		SELECT
	End of group
		CURSOR_LEFT
	End of group
		CURSOR_LEFT
	End of group
		CURSOR_UP
	End of group
End of macro
</pre>
This selfmade example will designate a 3 tiles wide ramp one z-level below and place the cursor to make the next execution of the macro continue the way down. The first line has to be the name of the file. You can see that there are grouping tags for every single keypress. These are important for a working macro.<br />
It is unknown if there is the possibility of creating loops/iterations, other programming features or comments.<br />

Removing macros in-game can be done by pressing {{k|Esc}} and then selecting Keybindings > Macros. Press {{k|Backspace}} on the macros you want to delete, then press {{k|Esc}} and select "Save and Exit". This will also delete the corresponding macro file permanently. Otherwise, you can delete the corresponding .mak file from the init/macros/ folder, although that will only take effect the next time DF is run.

Changing macros while the game is running uses a counter-intuitive process.  After editing the macro file, create a backup of it and remove the macro as described earlier. However, before saving the changes, place the backup file on the init/macros/ folder. Then save the changes and reload the macro with {{k|Ctrl}}+{{k|l}}.

Adding macros is also possible, resorting to the macro changing process. A "dummy" macro would be recorded and saved, then deleted. The macro that would be added would replace the dummy file.

=== Tuning macros ===
The fewer commands a macro consists of, the faster it runs. This means the first way to speed them up is to avoid unnecessary steps by optimizing the "path" of your designations.

The second and most effective way to increase speed is to remove all unnecessary commands DF recorded. The macros you save are found in the <code>prefs/macros</code> folder (see [[game folders and files]] for where that can be) and edited with any basic text editing program. The extra commands are ignored by the game but they still take time to be processed. To move a cursor 3 (up/down) or 4 (right/left) commands are recorded, most other keys are bound to more commands. Pressing {{k|d}} for example records more than 30 commands.

For example the code below is a simple macro that selects the digging designation, moves one square to the right, and then designates that tile to be dug.
<pre>

Here is the same code but optimized through removal of all the excess commands. Each macro also contains an addition CUSTOM_CTRL_R command at the end that may be removed as well.

The third way to increase the speed of macros is to change [[Settings#Input_timings|settings]] in the game or in the <code>[[init.txt]]</code> file, there you need to find the following lines: 
<pre>
[KEY_REPEAT_ACCEL_LIMIT:8]
[KEY_REPEAT_ACCEL_START:10]
[MACRO_MS:15]
</pre>

* The <code>MACRO_MS</code> setting is the number of milliseconds between macro instructions (the default, 15, allows 1000/15 instructions per second, or about 66). Decreasing this makes macros run '''faster''', although decreasing it too far can make the game unresponsive while the macro is running, or skip macro commands.
* The <code>KEY_REPEAT_ACCEL_START</code> and <code>KEY_REPEAT_ACCEL_LIMIT</code> settings are only related to macros while recording them.

== External utilities ==

=== [http://joelpt.net/quickfort/ QuickFort] ===
A spreadsheet-driven construction tool for Dwarf Fortress. Converts CSV files containing a "graphical" (or at least two-dimensional) representation of what you want to build into efficient DF macros. Comes with a number of scripts to get you started, some of them quite complex.

=== AutoHotKey ===
AutoHotKey is a powerful easy-to-use scripting language that can simulate keystrokes. (among other functions)

To started:
#  Go to the [http://www.autohotkey.com/ AutoHotKey website] and download AutoHotKey.  Installation is simple and the program uses very little system resources.
#  Read through their [http://www.autohotkey.com/docs/Tutorial.htm quick-start guide] and start write your macro scripts (file type .ahk), which may contain any number of commands.  You activate scripts by double-clicking .ahk files or by assigning hotkeys to your macros.  Both of these can be done at any time - even right in the middle of a game.  AutoHotKey also allows for automated activation of scripts.

=== Fluxbox + xvkbd ===
For linux, it's a quite cool solution. It's possible to create macros with outside tools, like fluxbox (linux window manager) + xvkbd (linux virtual keyboard for kiosks, with some macro capabilities). See the documentation [[Fluxbox_macros|here]]. 

Pros:
*Faster execution
*Easier script writing
*Portable code
Cons:
*Sometime needs timing
*Need xvkbd (Linux at least)
*Need some special key reservation

== Useful Macro Ideas ==

The following are macro ideas that other players have found useful, and may make management of your fort easier. For most macros it's highly recommended to '''pause the game''' before hitting the play button to avoid your dwarves causing unexpected behavior, i.e. a dwarf giving birth or anything else that auto-zooms to a different location.

=== Large Bedrooms ===

Bedrooms, especially larger ones or large blocks of identical ones, involve a lot of designations and build orders. These macros are designed to streamline the process. For all of these mass-building macros you may wish to temporarily forbid any of your artifact or masterwork furniture, to avoid giving overly-valuable items to your dwarf peasantry.

==== Placing Beds and Furnitures ====

Before placing any beds or furnitures it has some problems as the keyboard cursor will back to the middle tile of the screen the every time designate the construction. 

So you've recorded a macro to dig out a series of bedrooms, and now you have to fill them. Bring up the {{k|b}}uild menu, select {{k|f}} urniture {{k|b}}ed, Select "use closest material" and "keep building after placement", and go the first position you want to place a bed in.

Start a new macro ({{k|Ctrl}}+{{k|r}}) and place the bed (selecting the first bed from the list), then move to the next bedroom in sequence. Repeat this until you reach the end of the row. If you are placing beds into multiple long rows of bedrooms, move the cursor to the first bed in the next row to make things faster. Use {{k|w}}/{{k|a}}/{{k|s}}/{{k|d}} to make the macro loop froward it will move 11 tiles away from start from the macro you record. Turn off macro recording ({{k|Ctrl}}+{{k|r}}), but don't exit the build menu. 
You can then save your macro if you wish, though it's not necessary.

Play the macro ({{k|Ctrl}}+{{k|p}}), and you have just laid out another row. Repeat until you have enough bedrooms or you run out of beds.

=== Mass Trap Builder ===

It's basically just the same as building items in bedrooms, but for traps. Useful for populating entire hallways with weapon or stone-fall traps.

=== Custom Uniforms ===

Since custom uniforms are not saved from one fortress to another, it can be tedious to remake them after each new embark. Instead, you can record a few macros to create each of your custom uniforms (Axedwarves with full armor, Wrestlers with light armor, Archers, Civilians, etc.) It is recommended to start recording each macro from the main window, before entering the (m)ilitary screen, and to avoid naming the uniform as part of the macro.  Because of the way the uniform menu is set up, you should also be careful not to move the cursor back into the uniform list during the recording of your macro, or problems may arise. As always, pause the game before you start recording or playback.

=== Digging in Odd Directions/Shapes ===

While it is very simple and fast to designate mining in any of the 6 possible linear directions (North, East, South, West, Up, and Down) in very long sections, specialized mining, such as diagonal hallways, circular rooms, etc., are more difficult.  It may be worth, for example, recording 4 macros that dig a short section of 3-tile wide hallway in non-standard directions (NE, NW, SW, and SE).  This way, when you want a hallway dug at a 45 degree angle you just load the appropriate macro and keep playing it until the hallway is the desired length.

=== Downshafts ===

Simple up/down stairs are easy to do, but if your standard fort layout includes stairs with empty spaces around them, like so...
<pre>
       (rooms)

        %%..%%
        %....%
(more   ..XX.. (still
 rooms) ..XX..  more
        %....%  rooms)
        %%..%%

       (etc...)
</pre>
...it can be cumbersome to designate all of that for multiple Z-levels at once. Instead, create a macro from one reference point (say, the top-left staircase of the 2x2 shaft or some such) and hit record, then designate the staircase area as you see fit. Move the cursor back to your reference point and move down one Z-level, then stop recording. You can now load it up and play it wherever you need it.

For added awesomeness, trim out the extra commands in a text editor as described above. Then highlight the whole macro and copy/paste it into a new file, copying the commands 5 times or as many as you want. Then save the new macro as a separate file (be sure to rename it at the top of the macro text as well). In this way you can have easy-to-use macros for digging your own standard stairwell. Separate macros for 1 level, 5 levels, and 20 levels seem to work well.

== Troubleshooting Scripts ==
Users may experience some issues in getting external scripts to work, particularly when using looping scripts when experiencing low frame-rates.
* If experiencing low frame-rates, try adding delays ("Sleep 100" to pause for 100 milliseconds for example) within macros to allow the interface to keep up. If there are nested loops, sometimes adding a pause at the end of an inner loop is all that is needed to flush the keyboard buffer.
* Another way to add delay during and after each simulated key press is to put <B>SetKeyDelay, 40, 40</B> at the start of the macro.
* Make sure that Dwarf Fortress maintains focus. IM windows are the enemy! Who needs friends anyhow? You've got Dwarf Fortress.
* This may go without saying, but most macros assume standard key-mappings. If you're using non-standard ones, you may have to edit the macro to get it to work.
* Visiting liaisons can bring up screens that eat keystrokes, throwing a long-looping script out-of-phase with where it expects the game to be.  Wait for the farewell screen before running a long script, or just pause the game beforehand.
* The <B>SendPlay</B> function supports keys that the <B>Send</B> function does not, for example {{key|Shift-Enter}}.  According to the AutoHotKey documentation, <B>SendPlay</B> may also be better at preventing dropped keystrokes.

=== General Fortress Mode Hotkeys Script ===
An attempt at speeding up various designations. Includes an up/down stair builder, a fast move up/down, and some select-and-advance keys. Please see [[user:DDR#Dwarf_Fortress_General_AHK_Script]].
