'''Kiwi men''' are [[animal people]] variants of the common [[kiwi]], who inhabit [[savage]] [[temperate]] [[shrubland]]s and [[forest]]s. They spawn in groups of anywhere between 5-10 individuals and are generally content to keep to themselves. In terms of size, they are a little over half the weight of the average [[dwarf]].

Like other savage animal people, kiwi men can join [[civilization]]s, become [[historical figure]]s, appear as [[visitor]]s and be playable in [[adventurer mode]].

Some dwarves [[Preferences|like]] kiwi men for their ''long beaks''.

<!-- Reference: "Kiwi" as a nickname for residents of New Zealand -->
Despite common belief, there appears to be no major connection between the location of kiwi men and their proximity to countries far east of badland continents.
