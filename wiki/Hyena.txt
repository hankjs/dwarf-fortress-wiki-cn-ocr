'''Hyenas''' are rare carnivorous [[Creature|animals]] who inhabit [[tropical]] flatlands, where they appear in packs of 5-15 individuals. As heavy as a [[dwarf]], these predators' high numbers make them a threat to a lone individual if they're unlucky enough to be caught in their path, especially in [[adventurer mode]], though their very low frequency rate means they may not even be encountered at all. They possess thick fur which provides them with increased insulation compared to most other animals. A newborn hyena is called a ''cub''.

Hyenas can be captured in [[cage]] [[trap]]s and trained into low-value exotic [[pet]]s, and fully tame individuals may be brought in [[Elf|elven]] [[caravan]]s. They give a decent amount of returns if [[butcher]]ed, but their rarity makes them poor targets for a [[meat industry]]. Products made from hyena parts are [[Item value|worth]] twice more than those made from more common animals.

Some dwarves [[Preferences|like]] hyenas for their ''distinctive laugh'' and their ''coordinated hunting''.
