'''Stairs''' allow [[creatures]] to travel across z-levels. They can be dug out or constructed. They need to be connected to other stairs of the appropriate type to function. Up stairs need to be built below down stairs. Up/down stairs function as both up and down stairs at once.

Caravan [[wagon]]s can't travel across stairs -- you need [[ramp]]s for those to be able to reach your [[trade depot]].

Stairs do not block creature nor fluid movement. Falling creatures have a chance to stop falling on each level of stairs{{v|53.07}}, but may get seriously hurt if they fall several z-levels. [[Floor hatch]]es can stop both falling creatures and liquid. They can also be locked to keep those pesky [[crundle]]s from interrupting everything your dwarves could possibly do.

Down stairs reveal a tile directly beneath them. If it's [[water|wet]] or [[magma|warm]], any further [[mining]] designation on this tile will be automatically removed, but can then be manually replaced. (i.e. the game gives you a warning when that tile is first revealed, then assumes you know what you're doing. Don't prove the game [[flood|wrong]].)

As with all [[construction]]s, stairs can only be [[Construction removal|removed]] by dwarves ordered to do so or via [[cave-in]]s. Dug-out stairs can melt if made from [[ice]], but are otherwise just as resistant to damage - they can be removed by channeling the stair tile.

Stairs are fully capable of holding any amount of weight above them. An up stair or up/down stair will stop tiles falling during a [[cave-in]]; a down stair will not. However, when any stair tile is collapsed by a cave-in, the stairs disappear entirely.

== Planning stairs ==

Stairs can be created in two different ways, or a combination of them: 
* You can use the digging orders menu {{Menu icon|m}} and select stair mining ({{k|t}}) to carve them out of a wall of unmined material (see [[digging]]).
* You can use the build menu {{Menu icon|b}} and hit {{k|n}} to construct them in an open tile ({{k|t}}) using material you have already gathered.

Stairs have been overhauled in v50; you can no longer designate up, down, or up/down stairwells to be carved. Instead, you select the tiles your stairwell will span, a selection at least 2 z-levels tall, and your dwarves will designate an interpretation of how the selected tiles should be filled with stair elements. They may not always agree with your intention, so you may wish to verify what actually got designated, particularly if the stairs will pass through previously modified rock. Designating an extra z-level on top and immediately removing the down-stair designation from it will let you carve up/down stairs that can be extended upwards at a later time.

You can't carve up stairs on a square that has already been dug out; you have to carve one out of an existing wall, or {{k|b}}uild (construct) the up-stair instead.

Stairs cannot be constructed upwards if the destination z-level is inaccessible; you can't begin construction on an up-stair if you don't already have a clear path above you. This includes if the destination tile of the up-stair is another up-stair, meaning that a stairwell through existing floors must be constructed from the top down or have alternative access to the higher z-levels. Careless renovation of stairwells can result in inaccessible upper floors.

Some conflicts exist between ''constructed'' stairs and ''carved'' stairs. Up-stairs can be always constructed on top of any down-stairs, leading to a tile with up-down stairs, provided there's clearance on the z-level above you. You '''cannot''' ''carve'' down-stairs into a ''constructed'' up-stairs; you will have to (temporarily) deconstruct the up-stair you built if you want to carve downwards at that spot. You can, however, carve down-stairs into ''carved'' up-stairs. Constructing a floor on a tile with carved up-down stairs will destroy all the stairs and leave you with just a constructed floor (and a stranded dwarf unless there is another path back up). To plug the floor hole of a carved up-down stair, you need to construct both a floor and a new up-stair, requiring two stones or blocks, as well as access to the tile from the side.

Stairs can not be created through existing [[Stockpile|stockpiles]] (as they are considered a [[Building|building]]), however stockpiles ''can'' be designated over stairs (and items will be stored there). In order to dig or construct stairs through a stockpile you must first remove that part of the stockpile by erasing the section where you would like stairs to be, then you can construct the stairs, and then, if you wish, you can replace the stockpile.  Stairs can, however, be constructed through a [[Zone|zone]] so long as all other conditions are met.
