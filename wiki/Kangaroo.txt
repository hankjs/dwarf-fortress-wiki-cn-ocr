'''Kangaroos''' are a species of [[creature]] found in [[temperate]] and [[desert]] [[biome]]s, spawning in groups of 2–4 individuals. While bigger than a [[dwarf]], these animals are benign and do little but meander around aimlessly, fleeing from dwarves who provoke them, and only rarely defending themselves with punches, potent kicks and bites. Males of the species are called ''kangaroo bucks'', females are called ''kangaroo does'' and babies are called ''kangaroo joeys''.

Kangaroos can be captured in [[cage]] [[trap]]s and [[Animal trainer|trained]] into [[pet]]s. They are [[grazer]]s; and therefore require a [[pasture]] to survive after being trained, but are distinct for being one of the only exotic sources of [[milk]] and [[cheese]] (the other being the [[tapir]]). They provide a good amount of returns when [[butcher]]ed, being large enough to produce [[prepared organs]] when adults. They reach their full size at 2 years of age, and therefore should be butchered at that point, if so wished, for maximum returns.

Some dwarves [[Preferences|like]] kangaroos for their ''pouches'' and their ''great leaps''.

Contrary to claims by [[human]] [[scholar]]s, newborn kangaroos are not born without legs, nor are they smaller than [[rat]]s.
