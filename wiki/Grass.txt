'''Grass''' is a type of [[plant]] found in any biome that supports vegetation and is necessary to feed [[grazer|grazing]] animals. Grass can grow on most [[above ground]] [[soil]] and tends to spread quickly, as can be observed by building a large [[dirt road]] in an outdoor area. As dwarves and other [[creatures]] walk over it, they have a chance (determined by the value of the {{token|GRASSTRAMPLE|Creature}} token) of eroding it down to the base soil, on which trees and plants cannot grow. 

(e.g.: Elves have grasstrample 0. Dwarves have default grasstrample, which is 5. Dragons have grasstrample 50. Ergo, a mess of dwarves milling about your entrance will wear away all the grass, eventually, while a dragon does it with every step.) Grass erosion is also affected by grazing animals and fire.

[[Cave moss|Moss]], [[Floor fungus|fungi]], and [[Underlichen|lichen]], tiles similar to grass, appear in [[subterranean]] biomes; they will grow on underground soil and [[mud|muddy]] floors after a [[cavern]] has been breached. Livestock feed on them like they do on normal grass.

== Grazing ==

[[Livestock]] require a steady diet of grass in order to avoid starvation.  As they eat, the grass is eroded as though it were trampled, gradually denuding and depopulating their [[pasture]] if it isn't large enough. As there are at most 4 bunches of grass per tile, grass that is consumed in the process of an animal's grazing means that the base layer of soil is revealed until the grass grows back. There is currently no known way of determining how many of the maximum 4 bunches of grass are present in any one tile.

== Sand and clay ==

Grass growing on a soil [[floor]] of [[sand]] or [[clay]] will prevent the raw material from being [[Activity zone#Sand_Collection|collected]] for the [[glass industry|glass]] or [[ceramic industry|ceramic]] industries.  If grass has grown on a collection [[activity zone]], you can easily clear it by designating a dirt [[road]] ({{menu icon|b|n|O}}) on top of it.  A floor [[grate]] or paved road ({{menu icon|b|n|o}})can be placed over a collection activity zone to prevent grass from growing, while still allowing the raw material to be collected.

== Fire ==

Grass can also be destroyed by [[fire]] and [[magma]]. Creatures such as [[fire imp]]s can shoot fireballs when attacking, and these can set the grass on fire. If grass ignites, the fire will slowly spread to all connected grass, generating [[smoke]] as it burns. Fire turns grass into ashes, but not [[Ash|usable ashes]]. Anything that is flammable and stands on burning grass (if you look at it, you will see "A fire") has a chance to catch fire each turn. Note that fire breath will also set grass on fire, as well as instantly turning it into ashes. Grassy [[ramp|slope]]s will not catch on fire, thus preventing the fire from spreading across [[z-level]]s solely via grass. Burning trees, however, can allow fire to make the jump between z-levels.

== Variation ==

During a dry season, grass tiles on the screen change into dry grass tiles, but the effect is purely cosmetic. 

In [[good]] biomes, you may find grass made up of [[bubble bulb|bubbles]] and [[downy grass|feathers]] acting just like regular grass for the [[livestock]] that eat it.

In [[evil]] biomes, you may find grass made up of [[wormy tendril]]s and [[staring eyeball]]s. Like their good counterparts, they feed [[livestock]] normally. Wormy tendrils tend to wiggle constantly and staring eyeballs will blink from time to time. In evil biomes that are also undead areas, much of the grass (sometimes even evil grass) is dead, like the trees. Animals will not eat the dead grass. Assign a larger area for pastures so grazers can eat the patchy still-living grass.

Some grasses have flowers that bloom in spring. These are [[baby toes succulent]], [[cloudberry]], [[cottongrass]], [[marsh thistle]], [[meadowsweet]], [[mountain avens]], [[pebble plant]], and [[rush]].

== Relationship to real-world grasses ==

All "grass" types in the game, apart from the four special types found in evil and good biomes, are actual plants in the real world. The vast majority of them are also true grasses (this includes bamboo) or at least close relatives - rushes, sedges and [[cattail]]. The vegetation of some extreme biomes uses non-grass plants: mountain avens, mountain heather and [[cloudberry]] in mountains, [[baby toes succulent]] and [[pebble plant]] in deserts. Other notable exceptions are the [[marsh thistle]], [[knotgrass]] and [[meadowsweet]].
