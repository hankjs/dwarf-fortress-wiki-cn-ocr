'''Pump operator''' is the skill related to the '''pump operating''' [[labor]]. Pump operators use [[screw pump]]s to pump liquids manually. In order to use the pump, simply click the pump and select the checkbox to "Start pump manually". When you want the pumping stopped, simply untick the checkbox.

This is useful for starting a [[Water wheel#Perpetual motion|perpetual motion]] power plant, or to move liquid on short notice and with little investment in machinery. However, it's not a good idea to put fortress-critical pumps on manual labor, as pump operation requires continuous dwarven labor.
