'''Mountain goats''' are wild [[Creature|animals]] who may be found inhabiting [[mountain]]s. They appear in groups of 1-4 individuals and meander around the area, minding their own business. They are benign and will normally flee from [[Dwarf|dwarves]], but may rarely defend themselves with bites and kicks. A baby mountain goat is called a ''mountain goat kid''.

Mountain goats may be captured in [[cage]] [[trap]]s and [[Animal trainer|trained]] into [[pet]]s. In terms of [[size]] and value, mountain goats are identical to common [[goat]]s and as such perform the same way in a [[meat industry]], though unlike their domesticated cousins, they don't produce [[milk]]. Like domestic goats, a trained mountain goat will require a [[pasture]] to survive.

Some dwarves [[Preferences|like]] mountain goats for their ''beards'', their ''long horns'' and their ''surefootedness''.
==In real life==
Despite the name (and similarity in ''Dwarf Fortress''), mountain goats are not true goats (members of the genus [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Capra_(genus) ''Capra'']). Instead, they are a more distant relative on par with the [[sheep]] and the [[muskox]].
