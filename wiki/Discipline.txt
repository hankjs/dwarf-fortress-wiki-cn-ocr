'''Discipline''' is a [[skill]] that is highly relevant to [[military]] dwarves, and somewhat less important for civilians. A dwarf with high discipline is less likely to retreat in battle, cancel a job when witnessing death, or collapse/pass out from over-exertion. This makes it very useful for long, drawn-out fights, where exhaustion may be a factor and many dwarves may die; without discipline, even a dwarf with legendary weapon skills will panic and run before they are even able to do anything to the enemies trying to kill them, or might fall over and be killed just from sheer numbers. It is also helpful for keeping your medic from panicking when you're having a bit too much [[fun]] and they lose a patient with others waiting to be tended to.

Active military [[training]] raises the discipline skill (rather quickly, in fact), so giving your dwarves a few months of basic military training is helpful before throwing them onto the battlefield.

Being exposed to things such as dead bodies, being rained on, and cancelling jobs due to being "horrified" also contributes to the raising of the discipline skill.

Somewhat contrary to what one may expect, creatures with a naturally-high tolerance for mental stress and horror will actually have some difficulty training their discipline through exposure and live training, as they will not spend as much time being horrified by what is happening.
