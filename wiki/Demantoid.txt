'''Demantoid''' is a relatively-rare semi-precious [[gem]] found only in [[chromite]], which itself is only found in [[olivine]].

==In the real world==
'''Demantoids''' are effectively a variant of garnet, with the green and yellow colours a result of chromium and ferric iron (iron in the 3+ oxidation state).
