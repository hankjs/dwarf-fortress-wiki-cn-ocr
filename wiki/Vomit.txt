[[File:vomit_tiles_v50.png|right]]
Under certain conditions, [[creature]]s (such as your [[dwarf|dwarves]]) will '''vomit''', creating a [[contaminant|puddle of vomit]]. This may occur from an injury to an organ (usually the stomach, pancreas, and such), or from [[cave adaptation]]. Vomiting does not seem to create an unhappy thought ("nauseated by the sun" is from cave adaptation). Eating too much in [[adventurer mode]] will cause an adventurer to vomit. After vomiting once, a creature will begin to retch, bringing up nothing. The retching will continue in place of vomiting until the creature eats again. For example, dwarves that have been stationed for too long without food or water will occasionally eat vomit, causing an unhappy thought.

[[Titan]]s, [[forgotten beast]]s, and [[demon]]s are occasionally made of vomit, though, unless paired with a dangerous attack, these creatures are relatively weak due to liquids like vomit being extremely fragile to damage.
