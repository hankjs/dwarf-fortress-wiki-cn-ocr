'''Giant orcas''' are [[Giant animal|big]] – [[list of creatures by adult size#end of list|really big]]. Of ''all'' the creatures in ''Dwarf Fortress'', only the [[giant sperm whale]] is larger. A single specimen can feed a fortress for years and keep [[bone carver]]s very busy, but giant orcas appear in groups of 3-'''9'''. If that massive bounty isn't enough to motivate your dwarves to leave dry land, you're in luck: giant orcas are also prone to [[beaching]] themselves on shore, leaving a corpse ripe for [[butcher]]ing. Giant orcas can prove very valuable to any fort on a [[savage]] [[ocean]]. Dwarves in a [[terrifying]] biome should fear them as well – [[zombie]] orcas may crawl up on dry land.

Some dwarves [[preference|like]] giant orcas for their ''coloration'' and ''great jumps'', though one imagines that they admire both from quite a distance.
