Dwarves with the '''lever operation''' [[labor]] enabled (default) will pull [[lever]]s with a {{k|P}}ull job queued. Limiting this labor to only dwarves that will be near the lever (such as in a [[Burrow]]) is important to avoid having the job assigned to a dwarf hundreds of squares from the lever in a crisis.
