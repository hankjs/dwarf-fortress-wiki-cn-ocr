'''Capybaras''' are [[amphibious]] [[creature]]s who can be found in [[wetland]]s, appearing in groups of anywhere between 5-10 individuals. Smaller than [[Dwarf|dwarves]], they aren't entirely benign but will rarely pose a threat to civilians, preferring to avoid confrontation if possible (however they will attack pet dogs and the like, and even can gain a name from their kills out in your pastures). They hold the distinction of being one of the few creatures who emit [[noise]]s in [[adventurer mode]] (alongside the [[kakapo]]), with the game describing their whistling, barks, clicks, grunts and purrs as you approach them. A newborn capybara is called a ''pup''.

Capybaras can be captured in [[cage]] [[trap]]s and [[Animal trainer|tamed]] into [[pet]]s. Given their large cluster numbers, capturing a large number of them is relatively easy, and they provide a good amount of returns when [[butcher]]ed, making them acceptable targets for a [[meat industry]]. Note that tamed capybaras are [[grazer]]s, and therefore require a [[pasture]] to survive. Products made from capybara parts are worth [[Multiply value|twice]] more than those made out of common domestic animals.

Some dwarves [[preference|like]] capybaras for their ''enormous rodentness'', their ''graceful swimming'', or their ''resonant barking''.
