'''Clothier''' is the skill associated with the '''clothesmaking''' [[labor]]. Clothiers make [[cloth|plant fiber]], [[yarn]], and [[silk]] clothing items at the [[clothier's shop]], and can sew plant fiber images and silk images onto items.

Clothier [[skill|skill level]] is used to determine the [[quality]] of the created [[finished goods|good]]. The quality of the [[cloth]] and [[dye]] used adds to the value of the final product. Graphically, they wear blue tunics with green underclothing, gloves and shoes.

Clothiers also make plant fiber and silk crafts at the [[craftsdwarf's workshop]].

== Bugs ==
Due to a bug with hospital stockpiles{{Bug|771}}, partially used thread and cloth may be cycled into other stockpiles, and are not usable by clothiers or dyers.

Clothiers may cancel making clothes if there is only one left of one kind of cloth of the type (plant fiber/yarn/silk) they are told to use, even if more of another kind of that same type of cloth is available (e.g. 1 [[rope reed]] cloth and 16 [[pig tail]] cloth). {{Bug|5842}} The workaround is to forbid that single roll of cloth until you have more than one of it.
