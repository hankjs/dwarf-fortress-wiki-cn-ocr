'''Giant damselflies''' are much [[giant animal|larger]] versions of the standard [[damselfly]] [[vermin]]. They can be encountered in [[savage]] [[lake]]s, however they won't be useful for anything other than immediate [[butcher]]ing, as they have a maximum lifespan of one year, like other giant insects. As they are not actually {{token|BENIGN|c}}, wild ones might often annoyingly interrupt your [[dwarf|dwarves]] when spotted.

Some dwarves [[Preferences|like]] giant damselflies for their ''coloration''.
