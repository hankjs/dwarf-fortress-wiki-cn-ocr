'''Sea lampreys''' are a species of [[Creature|fish]] found in any non-[[tropical]] body of [[water]], excluding [[pool]]s. As big as a [[kobold]], they provide a fair amount of returns when [[butcher]]ed. As non-[[vermin]] fish, sea lampreys can't be fished by [[Fisherdwarf|fisherdwarves]], but can be caught with the use of a [[drowning chamber]]. Infant sea lampreys are called ''larval sea lampreys''. These should not be confused with the [[brook lamprey]], a harmless [[vermin]] fish.

Some dwarves [[Preferences|like]] sea lampreys for their ''suckers''.

It also happens to have the {{token|LARGE_PREDATOR|c}} tag, despite being half the size of a [[carp]].

Despite being called a sea lamprey, they seem to fare perfectly fine in any body of water. 

'''Be afraid.'''
