'''Flying squirrels''' are a type of [[above ground]] [[vermin]] found in any [[temperate]] [[forest]], and can be captured by [[trapper]]s and turned into [[pet]]s. They are born with Legendary [[skill]] in [[Climber|climbing]].

Some dwarves [[Preferences|like]] flying squirrels for their ''gliding'' and their ''large eyes''.
