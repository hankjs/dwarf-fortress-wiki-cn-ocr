'''Giant sponges''' are larger versions of [[sponge]]s, being found in savage rivers, lakes and oceans.

Physically, giant sponges are blobs made of "sponge" tissue. Their lack of articulations or body parts means they can only be killed through thorough pulping, but due to the sponge's weak material properties (even weaker than flesh), doing so with blunt weapons is not too difficult. However, their large size means they can shatter bones, articulations, bruise organs or even kill a dwarf via headshot using their default [[push]] attack. They may also themselves pulp body parts beyond recognition, as the push attack is also a blunt attack. How a giant sponge's soft structural tissue can break a dwarven skull is a [[physics|mystery for the ages]].

If some hapless [[dwarf]] appears near their water, giant sponges may feel suddenly threatened and charge (!) the hapless dwarf and engage in combat - the only occasion when they move at all.  They may also become enraged or unconscious or feel pain, as utterly improbable as that sounds.

''"Without a nervous system, the only thing it can feel is ANGER."

According to its raws, the giant sponge can not only be tamed but even ''ridden as a war beast'' by invaders. No reports of goblins or elves riding giant sponges has been documented, but maybe its strictly aquatic lifestyle prevents it from being chosen.

Some dwarves [[Preferences|like]] giant sponges for their ''squishy texture''.

== History ==

Before pulping was introduced in [[df2014:Release_information|v0.40]], giant sponges were virtually unkillable ([[atom smasher|atom smashing]] and [[cave-in]]s still worked). Due to this, they were widely considered the aquatic [[v0.34:king_of_beasts|king of beasts]].

== Bugs ==

*Rangers and Hunters may try to hunt giant sponges, wasting bolts that become lost in the water or lodged in the sponge itself. This may also lead to near-endless "Urist McHunterpants, Ranger cancels Hunt: Could Not Find Path" messages.
