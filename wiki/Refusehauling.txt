'''Refuse Hauling''' is a [[labor]] which has no associated [[skill]]. A dwarf with refuse hauling enabled will haul items of [[refuse]] to refuse [[stockpile]]s. Refuse hauling is also used to haul items marked for [[dump]]ing to a [[garbage dump]] zone.

All refuse hauling jobs are controlled by the "refuse collection" options in the [[standing orders]] menu.
