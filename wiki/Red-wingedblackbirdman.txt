'''Red-winged blackbird men''' are [[animal people]] variants of the common [[red-winged blackbird]] who inhabit [[savage]] [[temperate]] [[wetland]]s. They spawn in groups of anywhere between 5-10 individuals and are generally content to keep to themselves. In terms of size, they are a little over half the weight of the average [[dwarf]]. All red-winged blackbird men are born with Legendary [[skill]] in [[Climber|climbing]].

Like other savage animal people, red-winged blackbird men can join [[civilization]]s, become [[historical figure]]s, appear as [[visitor]]s and be playable in [[adventurer mode]].

Some dwarves [[Preferences|like]] red-winged blackbird men for their ''coloration''.
