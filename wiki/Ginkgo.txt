'''Ginkgo''' is one of the many ''genera'' of [[tree]]s found [[above ground]]. Like the vast majority of above ground trees, ginkgo [[wood]] is brown and produces brown products. 

Ginkgo trees frequently have 2-tile-wide trunks.  Ginkgo seeds can be harvested by setting up a plant gathering [[zone]], and can be eaten or cooked. Ginkgo leaves can be processed in a [[dyer's shop]] into lemon [[dye]].

Some [[Dwarf|dwarves]] [[Preferences|like]] ginkgo trees for their ''seeds''.
