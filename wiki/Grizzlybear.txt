'''Grizzly bears''' are large, tough mammalian [[Creature|carnivores]] that inhabit [[temperate]] [[forest]]s and [[taiga]]s. They may be drawn to your fortress in search of [[food]]; they will locate and [[Thief|consume]] any food and [[drink]] that your [[dwarves]] have carelessly left lying around. This can be particularly [[fun]] for new fortresses without a seasoned [[military]], when their entire food and alcohol supply is destroyed in moments, and don't expect an unarmed and unarmored dwarf to win against a creature that's more than three times their size. Grizzly bears are very rare; such that only two to three of them will exist in a single region before they are considered locally [[extinct]]. They'll also not spawn during the winter, mimicking real-life hibernation.

However, the above tactic makes them pretty easy to trap in a [[cage]] [[trap]]. Make a small food/booze [[stockpile]] and surround it with cage traps on all sides. Grizzly bears will be attracted to the food and booze, and become trapped in the cage trap. They can then be [[animal trainer|trained]] into valuable exotic [[pet]]s. Trained grizzly bears can be further turned into war and hunting beasts, being a popular choice for war animals since they are large and strong enough to do some serious damage. They are also frequently available from [[elf|elven]] [[caravan]]s, as elves tend to live in temperate forests. Should you [[butcher]] them, products made from their parts are 3 times more valuable than those made from common domestic animals.

Much larger and stronger than your regular [[dog]], war grizzlies can make fast work of an [[ambush]] if they aren't outnumbered. Their powerful jaws can puncture straight through common [[iron]] [[armor|mail]], making a nice snack out of unprepared foes. Having a couple of Elite [[Crossbowman|Marksdwarves]] with 10 bears assigned is a splendid idea, as the bears will act as a biting meat shield, while your [[crossbow]]dwarves take care of the tougher enemies the bears can't handle. Grizzly bears are exotic [[mount]]s and are sometimes spotted being ridden by [[human]]s during [[siege]]s.

Some dwarves [[Preferences|like]] grizzly bears for their ''strength''.

{{D for Dwarf}}

In world gen, a green grizzly bear with mental problems will form a relationship with a porcupine.  But this always ends in [[fun]] for the porcupine.  They choose red porcupines more over regular ones.
