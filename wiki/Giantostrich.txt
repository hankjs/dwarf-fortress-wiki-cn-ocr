'''Giant ostriches''' are [[giant animal]] variants of the [[ostrich]], found in [[savage]] [[desert]]s, [[tropical]] [[savanna]]s and tropical [[grassland]]s. Like the regular ostrich, these animals appear in small groups of up to ten individuals. Being benign creatures they will meander and generally keep to themselves. Giant ostriches are roughly the size of a [[water buffalo]], or 14 times larger than a [[dwarf]], and as such they are a force to be reckoned with against a poorly equipped militia if provoked. Males are called ''giant ostrich cocks'' and females are called ''giant ostrich hens''.

Giant ostriches can be captured in [[cage]] [[trap]]s and [[Animal trainer|trained]] into [[exotic pet|exotic]] [[pet]]s, possessing the unusually high value of 1000. Their large size translates into a good amount of products if they are [[butcher]]ed, and they lay a fairly high amount of [[egg]]s if placed in a [[nest box]]. Like all giant animals, they are considered [[exotic mount|exotic]] [[mount]]s.

Some dwarves [[Preference|like]] giant ostriches for their ''long necks'' and their ''giant eggs''.
