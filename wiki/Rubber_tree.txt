'''Rubber trees''' are a type of [[above ground]] [[tree]], found in [[tropical]] moist broadleaf [[forest|forests]]. Rubber [[carpenter|wood]] is brown (referred in the raws as "flax") and produces brown products. 

As of yet, latex cannot be extracted from rubber trees.

Some [[Dwarf|dwarves]] [[Preferences|like]] rubber trees for their ''branch shedding''.
