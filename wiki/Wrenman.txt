'''Wren men''' are humanoid versions of the common [[wren]] and a [[Creature|species]] of unremarkable [[animal people]], found in most [[savage]] [[biome]]s. They are only half the size of an adult [[dwarf]] and as such, are unlikely to be a threat to even an unarmed civilian, though their ability to fly may make them difficult to hit. Like other savage animal people, wren men may occasionally join [[civilization]]s, becoming full-fledged citizens who may appear in your fortress as [[visitor]]s, become [[historical figure]]s, or be playable in [[adventurer mode]].

Some dwarves [[Preferences|like]] wren men for their ''intricate songs''.
