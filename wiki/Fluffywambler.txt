'''Fluffy wamblers''' are humanoid [[vermin]] that can be found the world over in [[good]] regions. They can be captured by [[trapper]]s and turned into low-value [[pet]]s. They are tied with the [[fox squirrel]] as the largest of all vermin, being only a little smaller than a [[dwarf]] baby.

They possess a few unusual characteristics; their entire bodies are covered in white fur known as "fluff", while their equivalent of [[fat]] is called "pudge". Fluffy wamblers have no organs, bones or blood, with the entirety of their interior being composed of purple pudge. Despite this, they will sometimes attempt to eat [[food]] out of [[stockpile]]s, similarly to other vermin like [[rat]]s, and like them, it only takes a [[cat]] to solve the problem. Their raws note an immunity to [[Syndrome|fevers]], which vermin aren't known to be affected by to begin with. In [[adventurer mode]], fluffy wamblers can only be found during the day.

Some dwarves [[Preferences|like]] fluffy wamblers for their ''warm heart'', their ''gentle nature'' and their ''stumble bumbling''.

Fluffy wamblers are surprisingly dense when traveling at high velocities.  There was {{f|56935.0|at least one}} reported slaying of a [[bronze colossus]] using a thrown fluffy wambler as a [[weapon]]. News of this incident has served to increase the wambler's popular appeal. Despite their status as agricultural pests, it's rare to find a being that actually finds them offensive. They are widely held to be "adorable", and many dwarves consider them to be [[food|a delicacy]].

Wamblers are not wholly benign and may in fact display aggression when threatened, an act which is almost always futile, as they have power to harm only the feeblest of creatures. Civilizations that use "good" animals and animal materials (and have no qualms about killing animals) can make clothes out of wambler fluff, a prized, yet inexpensive, insulating fabric.

Wamblers maintain a body temperature slightly higher than that of dwarves. They appear to be immune to sickness and are not known to suffer infection of any kind. There is no specific term for any hypothetical wambler offspring; a live wambler birthing has never been seen. One case exists of a wambler possibly resurrecting itself deep underground. The corpse was carried many levels underground by a cat into an active mining area well away from any sort of entrance, then later the corpse was missing and a live wambler was wandering around down in the mining area 13 floors down underground. Up to that point, no other live wamblers had been seen anywhere within the tunnels.
