{{distinguish|Metalsmith's forge}}

The '''magma forge''' is a [[workshop]] used by [[dwarf|dwarves]] to turn [[metal|metal bars]] into useful objects such as [[weapon]]s, [[ammunition]], [[armor]], [[furniture]], [[coins]], [[trap component]]s, metal crafts and [[siege engine|ballista arrow heads]] without the need for [[fuel]] to heat the forge. For its counterpart that use fuel, see [[Metalsmith's forge]].

To build a magma forge, you must have [[magma-safe]] materials (non-magma-safe materials will not be shown on the material list), an [[anvil]], and a build site where at least one tile directly beneath one of its eight non-center tiles contains [[magma]] at a depth of 4/7 or greater.

Note that the anvil used to build a magma forge ''does'' need to be magma-safe—normally anvils can only be made from magma-safe materials, but [[strange mood]]s can create artifact anvils which cannot be used at a magma forge (or, in the case of metals like [[zinc]], at ''any'' forge).

Unlike previous versions, the Magma Forge no longer blocks open space into the molten rock below. If your dwarves (or any other creature) dodges into that open space they will be taking a magma bath.

While it is possible to construct a magma forge without open access to magma beneath any of its 9 squares, it will not operate (you will be unable to add tasks to the workshop). Note also that, like all workshops, ''the central tile must be built over solid ground'', as it is required for a dwarf to stand there to use the workshop, and therefore cannot be the square used to access magma (you will be blocked from building the workshop).

Creatures can climb up through the open tile that the building is built on, making them a potential entry point into your fortress. The magma forge in older versions had an [[impassable tile]] that could be used to prevent this, but it has been removed as of v50.

==Workshop labors and skills==
Several different types of items can be created at a metalsmith's forge; dwarves will need the correct type of [[labor]] enabled for each.  The labors used at a forge are:

*[[Weaponsmith]]ing – [[weapon]]s, [[trap]] components, [[bolt]]s, and [[ballista arrowhead]]s
*[[Armorsmith|Armoring]] (armorer) – [[armor]]
*[[Metal crafter|Metalcrafting]] – [[Restraint|chains]], musical [[instrument]] components, and everything in the "Other Objects" category ([[craft]]s, [[coins]], [[goblet]]s, [[stud]]ding, etc.), except anvils 
*[[Blacksmith|Blacksmithing]] – [[Anvil]]s, [[block]]s, and all [[furniture]] except chains.
*[[Trapper|Trapping]] – Animal Traps.
*[[Mechanic]]s – Mechanisms.

==Cost of items==

The cost of a weapon or piece of armor in metal bars can be calculated by dividing its material size by three and rounding down, with no item costing less than one metal bar. The exception to this is some types of finished goods, which are created in different multiples from a single metal bar, depending on the skill of the Metal crafter. The table on the [[Melt]] page lists the cost of common items and their yields when melted.

{{D for Dwarf}}
Notably, when testing weapons that were forged over magma, as opposed to weapons Forged in Fire, dwarves do not shout "It will kill" after slashing or bashing a nearby target.

==Strange mood==
Note that if the magma depth falls below 4/7, even for a moment, the forge will immediately cancel all of its jobs. If the forge has been claimed by a dwarf in a [[Strange mood]], this will result in instant [[insanity]], even if the forge returns to normal a moment later. For this reason it is advisable that you isolate the magma supply for your magma workshops from your other magma plumbing, and if possible use [[magma-safe]] floodgates or some other method to seal the magma into a separate channel solely for the use of the workshops. If a magma forge is in danger of losing power, it would be wise to forbid it before it is claimed and wait until it is powered up reliably. Once magma has been discovered, some moody dwarves will no longer be satisfied with a regular forge.
