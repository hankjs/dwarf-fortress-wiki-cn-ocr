Grossular is a mineral of the garnet group of chemical formula Ca<sub>3</sub>Al<sub>2</sub>Si<sub>3</sub>O<sub>12</sub>, making it the intersection between calcium garnets (ugrandites) and aluminum garnets (pyralspites). It is usually colored yellow to red by iron inclusions, but it may appear green from vanadium and chromium.
