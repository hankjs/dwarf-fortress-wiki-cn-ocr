'''Tunnel tubes''' are a type of [[underground]] [[tree]]. They are found in deep [[caverns]], and will grow on any [[mud|muddied]] [[rock]] or [[soil]] once found. When cut down, they yield violet logs suitable for producing colorful furniture. (Note that, in ASCII mode, [[rose gold]] is the same color, and can also be used to create furniture other than [[bed]]s, so if you are able to create it, breaching the second cavern layer may not be necessary.)

Some [[Dwarf|dwarves]] [[Preferences|like]] tunnel tubes for their ''curving trunk''.

Tunnel tubes, unlike certain [[adamantine|other]] tubes, are not known to be sources of [[Hidden Fun Stuff]]. There have yet to be recordings of woodcutters stumbling upon any orange-haired [[Sphere#Sphere tokens|nature-aligned]] creatures ruthlessly-protective of nature. For underground trees, the concept is silly anyway (despite what [[Elf|certain groups]] might say), since it doesn't take longer than 20 years and 10 months for an underground tree to fully grow.
