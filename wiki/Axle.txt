'''Axles''' are used to transmit [[power]] (as generated by a [[windmill]] or [[water wheel]]) over a distance. There are two types: vertical axles move power between [[z-level]]s, while horizontal axles move it north, south, east or west within a given level. Axles consume 1 unit of power per tile.

== Construction ==
Axles are constructed via the [[machine component]]s screen: ({{Menu icon|b|m|a|sep=-}}) for horizontal, ({{Menu icon|b|m|A|sep=-}}) for vertical; axles are never diagonal. Axles require the carpenter labor, and use logs, but the number of logs needed varies with the length and orientation of the axle. As they are made of wood, axles are NOT magma-proof, except for those made of [[nether-cap]]. 

<u>Vertical</u> axles require one log for every z-level. <u>Horizontal</u> axles require one log for 1-3 tiles length, two for 4-7, or three for 8-10.  When making a long chain of axles, building them in groups of 7 tiles long uses the least amount of logs, with an efficiency of 3.5 tiles per log.  If you are feeling lazy, building them in groups of 10 tiles is nearly as efficient: 3.33 tiles per log.*  Horizontal axles run East–West by default, but can be built oriented North–South.  

: (* Tile distances of 14, 21, 24, 28, 31, 34, 35, 38, 41, 42, 44, 45, 48, 49, 51, 52, 54, 55, 58, 59, 61-66, and 68+ will save you a log or more. Any other distance and the logs/tile used will be the same.)

Changing direction 90° requires a [[gear assembly]] at the corner between two perpendicular axles, whether the change is horizontal or vertical. The gear and the axles do not overlap into the same tile, but sit next to or on top of each other in adjacent tiles. Once they are adjacent, the [[power]] transfer is automatic; gear assemblies can be linked to a lever (or [[Pressure plate|other trigger]]) to stop the power transfer.

Floor tiles will obstruct the transfer of power over z-levels, so [[channel]]s need to be dug through every floor through which a vertical axle passes. (It is not possible to build a vertical axle through [[stairs]].) Be sure to build vertical axle stacks from the bottom z-level up. You cannot build the axle on open space (like directly below a [[windmill]]), but can build it on open space that has another axle, [[gear assembly]], or machine directly below.

Axles do not block unit movement and can be crossed by dwarves and minecarts without danger. But keep in mind that digging channels for a vertical axle usually results in a hole that cannot be crossed.
Also keep in mind that digging a deep vertical shaft for axles (for example, to bring power from a windmill on the surface to a [[roller]] in a deep underground mine shaft) has the danger of a dwarf falling down the pit, with predictable results.
