'''Tomatoes''' are an [[aboveground]] [[crop|garden vegetable]]. They can be planted in all seasons, the fruit is edible raw or [[cooking|cooked]], (seeds when cooked), and can also be [[brewing|brewed]] into [[alcohol|tomato wine]] or processed in a [[dyer's shop]] into amber [[dye]].

Some [[Dwarf|dwarves]] [[preferences|like]] tomato plants for their ''fruit''.

Note that this plant, along with buckwheat, is only found in worlds with poles and a Medium or Large size, since it's unique to the Tropical Dry Broadleaf forest biome which only generates under those conditions due to a bug.

Tomatoes are often employed by [[thrower|throwing]] them at [[performer|performers]] with low [[comedian]] skill who attempt to tell jokes.
