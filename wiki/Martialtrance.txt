[[Dwarves]] enter a '''martial trance''' when [[Combat|fighting]] multiple enemies at once. The trance offers a boost to the dwarf's abilities – a dwarf in a martial trance has a significantly increased chance of blocking or parrying an attack, and is more likely to hit their opponent. However, it does not give a direct damage bonus like '''enraged'''. The [[status icon]] for a dwarf in a trance is {{Tile|!|2:1}} which will flash over their [[Status icon|icon]]. A dwarf also appears to occasionally enter a trance even when not fighting, though this behavior is rare and may be a bug.

Dwarves are the only creatures which enter martial trances without [[modding]]. The RAW tag which determines this is {{token|TRANCES}}. A dwarven adventurer may also enter a martial trance in [[adventurer mode]]. Fresh recruits can, when pressed to fight, go into a martial trance as well.

This is also a great way to dispose of [[Bogeyman|bogeymen]] in adventurer mode, as you can dodge most of their attacks, and most of your attacks will land successfully, regardless of the difficulty of the shot.
