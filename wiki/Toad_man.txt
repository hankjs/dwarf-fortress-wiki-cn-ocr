'''Toad men''' are humanoid versions of the common [[toad]] and a [[Creature|species]] of unremarkable [[animal people]], spawning naturally in savage [[lake]]s.

They are a bit over half the size of [[dwarf|dwarves]] when adults and spawn in groups of 1-5 individuals, posing no threat to [[Dwarf|dwarves]] unless provoked.
Like other savage animal people, toad men can occasionally join [[civilization]]s, becoming full-fledged citizens who could appear in your fortress as [[visitor]]s, or [[historical figure]]s, or be playable in [[adventurer mode]].

Some dwarves [[Preferences|like]] toad men for their ''beauty''.

[[Main:Toady One|They]] are also known to spend their time programming obscure ASCII video games.

<!-- Reference: "Battletoads" video game -->
The absence of toad men has formed much speculation amongst civilizations. The most notable one involves a group of three intergalactic toad men who leap from planet to planet to defeat a "dark queen", whom had kidnapped all of the other toad men of the world.

<!-- Reference: Toad Man from Mega Man 4 -->
Toad men have also been reported to occupy dams, and these specific toad men seem to be followed around by rain. However, this does not make them harder to slay.

<!-- Reference: The Wind in the Willows -->
[[Embark|Embarking]] [[Dwarf|dwarves]] and [[Trade|merchant]] [[Caravan|caravans]] should beware, as toad men have been known to steal and crash unattended [[Wagon|wagons]].
