'''Giant weasels''' are [[giant animal| much larger]] versions of the common [[weasel]], found in most [[savage]] [[biome]]s. While the common animal is one of the smallest in the game, the giant variant is about three times bigger than a [[dwarf]], but they are generally harmless due to being benign. Like normal weasels, they are solitary, don't spawn during the winter and their young are called ''kits''.

Giants weasels may be captured in [[cage]] [[trap]]s and [[Animal trainer|trained]] into [[pet]]s. They're large enough to actually produce food when [[butcher]]ed, giving returns equivalent to a [[mule]] in quantity. Like their common counterparts, giant weasels are very short-lived, living no more than 2-3 years, making keeping them around for extended periods of time a questionable decision. Giant weasels are exotic [[mount]]s and may be witnessed being used by [[Elf|elves]] during [[siege]]s.

Some dwarves [[Preferences|like]] giant weasels for their ''long bodies'' and their ''short legs''.
