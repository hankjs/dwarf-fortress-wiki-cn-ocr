'''Giant adders''' are the [[giant animal]] variants of the common [[adder]], found in [[savage]] [[temperate]] regions. While the regular creature is the smallest non-[[vermin]] in the game, giant adders are roughly the size of a [[grizzly bear]] when fully grown, and are exponentially more threatening as a result. Giant adders retain the [[syndrome]] of their counterparts, causing immediate strong [[Symptom#Pain|pain]] followed by long-term nausea, blisters, and swelling, which, when combined with the larger size of the monster, may result in a bitten [[dwarf]] going unconscious in a matter of seconds if they do not just die outright.

Giant adders can be captured in [[cage]] [[trap]]s and [[Animal trainer|trained]] into [[pet]]s, possessing the default giant animal value. They are born adults and as such cannot be permanently tamed. Thanks to their great size, they provide a good amount of returns when [[butcher]]ed, and make decent [[egg]]-layers for [[egg production]]. Like all giant animals, they are considered exotic [[mount]]s.

Some dwarves [[Preferences|like]] giant adders for their ''warning hisses''.
