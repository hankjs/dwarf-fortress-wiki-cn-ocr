'''Beaching''' is a characteristically odd behavior carried out by [[creature]]s with a {{token|BEACH_FREQUENCY}} creature [[token]]. These [[aquatic]] animals will occasionally strand themselves on land, where they are immobile and unable to breathe. This is intended to model the poorly-explained real-life behavior of similar animals; see [[Wikipedia:cetacean stranding|cetacean stranding]] on Wikipedia for more information.
