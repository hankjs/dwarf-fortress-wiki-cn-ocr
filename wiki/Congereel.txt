'''Conger eels''' are a species of [[Creature|fish]] who can be found in [[temperate]] and [[arctic]] [[ocean]]s. Slightly smaller than a [[dwarf]], they provide a fair amount of returns when [[butcher]]ed. As non-[[vermin]] fish, conger eels can't be fished by [[Fisherdwarf|fisherdwarves]], but can be caught with the use of a [[drowning chamber]]. Infant conger eels are called ''conger eel fry''.

Some dwarves [[Preferences|like]] conger eels for their ''long bodies''.
