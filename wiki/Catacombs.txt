[[File:DevlogCatacombsLargeScale.png|thumb|250px|right|Largescale view of catacombs from Bay12 devlog.]]'''Catacombs''' are subterranean [[human]]-made [[structure]]s constructed to inter deceased members of their civilization. They are located in [[town]]s, accessible by traversing below [[temple]]s. Catacombs occasionally connect to [[tomb]]s, which specially hold the remains of dead rulers.

Rock passageways and chambers are littered with [[corpse|skeleton]]s. Some chambers contain multiple [[coffin]]s which house the corpses of historical figures, accompanied with grave [[slab]]s marked with information of the deceased. Loot, primarily [[clothing]], are scattered throughout the floor. [[Statue]]s can also be found. Knocking them down will not anger any gods; that must be done at the temple.

Various hostile and nefarious critters such as [[kobold]]s can be encountered in catacombs. [[Town#Criminal organizations|Criminal organizations]] may move their headquarters to catacombs.
