'''Ravens''' are small and very common [[Creature|birds]] who are found in almost all [[biome]]s in the game, where they appear in flocks of anywhere between 2-10 individuals. They are benign and do little but fly across the area aimlessly, rarely if ever paying mind to [[dwarves]] or other creatures, and even if they attack, they are unable to deal any significant damage to anything with so much as clothes on. Due to their {{token|NOT_BUTCHERABLE}} token, they are not [[butcher]]able if killed by a [[hunter]], but tame ones will yield a [[skull]] and occassional 2 [[meat]] when [[slaughter]]ed. All ravens are born with Legendary [[skill]] in [[Climber|climbing]].

Ravens can be captured in [[cage]] [[trap]]s and [[Animal trainer|trained]] into cheap [[pet]]s. They are useless for a [[meat industry]] due to giving nothing but a [[skull]] if trained and butchered, but can be a minor source of [[egg]]s (who are nonetheless surpassed by all domestic birds).

In reanimating [[evil]] [[biome]]s, undead raven swarms can absolutely live up to their grim reputation.  Necromancers or evil biome reanimating ravens, even without being "giant", are [http://www.bay12forums.com/smf/index.php?topic=108371.msg3235825#msg3235825 existential threats to a whole fortress], as are nearly any mid-to-large size flyer.

Some dwarves [[Preferences|like]] ravens for their ''intelligence''.

<!-- Reference: "The Raven", by Edgar Allan Poe -->
Ravens have a decent pet value, though they sometimes have the disconcerting habit of tapping on your [[bedroom|chamber]] [[door]]s.

Also, a high-ranking female [[Noble]] may require a tower full of ravens to keep as a symbol of her nobility. To satisfy her request, make sure you devoid the tower of any mean of escape, and only use the magnificent wild ravens (or even better, [[giant raven|giant wild ravens]]). [[Unfortunate accident|She will appreciate it]].

<!-- Reference: "Alice in Wonderland", by Lewis Carroll -->
Some [[Strange mood|moody]] [[clothier|hood makers]] have claimed that a raven is like a [[table|writing desk]], but whether or not that's true is a secret closely guarded by the clothier's [[guild]], who simply [[Insanity|smile]] when asked.
