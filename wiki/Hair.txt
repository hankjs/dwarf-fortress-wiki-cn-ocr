[[File:hair_sprite_preview.png|right]]'''Hair''' is a filament that grows out of a [[creature|creature's]] skin that can provide many functions. This can range from providing warmth to acting as feelers, expanding on the sensation of touch. It is handled in two different ways in the game, being attached to a creature, or being detached and made into a useful [[item]].

==Hair on living creatures==
Hair is part of the cosmetic layers that any creature can have. It can also have different colors, turning grey or white as creatures age.

==Hair as an item==
Hair is a byproduct of [[Butcher's shop|butchering]] some animals. It can be spun into [[thread]] at a [[farmer's workshop]]. Hair thread cannot be used to weave [[cloth]], but it can be [[dye]]d and used to [[Suturer|suture]] wounds in a [[hospital]] or bind [[book]]s in a [[craftsdwarf's workshop]].
