The '''oak''' is a type of [[above ground]] [[tree]] found in any [[temperate]] broadleaf [[forest]]. Like the overwhelming majority of overland trees, oak [[carpenter|wood]] is brown and produces brown products. Logs can be processed in a [[dyer's shop]] into brown [[dye]].

Oaks are notable for producing ''extreme'' amounts of wood logs when cut down. A fully-grown oak can produce at least 30 logs per tree, going over 40 at times, and can actually beat out the [[highwood]] for wood production.  The only problems are that, only growing in temperate broadleaf forests, they are frequently crowded in by other types of trees, and that it will be hard to find a use (or stockpile space) for all the logs one produces.  

Their acorns are also edible and extremely plentiful, although they are not brewable, and temperate broadleaf forests have plenty of fruit-bearing trees. You may want to harvest the oaks for wood, and keep the persimmon and cherry trees for fruits.

Some [[Dwarf|dwarves]] [[Preferences|like]] oaks for their ''acorns'' and their ''autumn coloration''.
