'''Gila monster men''' are [[animal people]] variants of the common [[gila monster]] who inhabit [[savage]] [[desert]]s. They spawn in groups of 1-3 individuals and like the template animal, they possess a [[Syndrome|venomous]] bite that causes pain and swelling on the victim, which they will likely use on any creature who provokes them. In terms of size, they are a little over half the weight of the average [[dwarf]].

Like other savage animal people, gila monster men can join [[civilization]]s, become [[historical figure]]s, appear as [[visitor]]s and be playable in [[adventurer mode]].

Some dwarves [[Preferences|like]] gila monster men for their ''venomous bite ''and their ''coloration''.
