'''Two-legged rhino lizards''' are a (fictional) type of [[vermin]] unique to [[savage]] areas. Aside from the savage requirement, however, they are ubiquitous, from scorching [[desert]]s to [[glacier]]s. They are essentially a [[lizard]] larger than a [[crow]] with only two legs. They are [[Creature_token#VERMIN_EATER|VERMIN_EATER]] with a [[Creature_token#PENETRATEPOWER|PENETRATEPOWER]] of 2, which means they're better at gnawing their way through your [[barrel]]s than most vermin.  

Unlike lizards (i.e., the [[wikipedia:Common_lizard|common lizard]], ''zootoca vivipara'', as stated in the [[Raw_file|raws]]), two-legged rhino lizards are not [[hateable]]. They have twice the [[pet#pet_value|pet value]] of lizards.

Some dwarves [[Preferences|like]] two-legged rhino lizards for their ''horn''.
