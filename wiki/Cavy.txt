'''Cavies''' are small [[domestic animal]]s that can also be found roaming [[tropical]] plains. They are not usable as livestock as they are too small to be used in a [[meat industry]] - [[butcher]]ing them will only give a [[skull]] in return - and they are tied with [[rabbit]]s and [[chinchilla]]s as the [[List of creatures by pet value|least valuable]] [[pet]]s in the game. Unclaimed tame cavies will require a [[pasture]] to survive, otherwise they will starve. The males of the species are known as ''boars'', the females are ''sows'', and the young are ''pups''.

Cavies make excellent live-bait in place of [[cat]]s if you want your bait to survive. They are quite agile and because of their small size, larger creatures such as [[forgotten beast]]s have trouble landing a proper attack on them, with many attacks simply glancing off because of force calculation overflow.

Cavies are more commonly known as ''guinea pigs'', but they are never referred as such in ''Dwarf Fortress''.

Some [[dwarves]] [[Preferences|like]] cavies for their ''adorable call'' and their ''[[Main:ThreeToe|three toes]]''.
