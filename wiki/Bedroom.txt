[[File:bedroom_icon_preview.png|right]]A '''bedroom''' is an [[Activity zone|activity zone]] that probably should contain a [[bed]]. Bedrooms are automatically claimed by [[dwarves]] (or spouses of dwarves); or they may be manually assigned to a dwarf. Once a bedroom has an owner, it becomes the private quarters for that dwarf, where they will [[sleep]], store any belongings that are not carried, and hang out in if there is no [[activity zone|meeting area]].

==Setup and ownership==
[[File:Quarters.png|thumb|280px|right|A typical bedroom in a Fortress]]A useful bedroom consists of a bed placed in a designated bedroom zone. You will need to craft a [[bed]] in a [[carpenter's workshop]], then {{Menu icon|b|f|b}} to build it. Dwarves will not sleep in beds which have been produced in a workshop until they are placed via the build menu. You can designate a bedroom from the {{Menu icon|z}}one menu before or after building the bed. If you build the beds first, however, you can use the nifty {{DFtext|Multi|2:1}} option to auto-designate individual bedrooms from a large selected area, each room must contain a bed and enclosed with a door. 

To remove a bedroom, enter {{Menu icon|z}}one mode and select it, then click "Remove this zone permanently" ([[File:UI Delete Area.png|28px]]).

A dwarf with no bedroom will automatically claim an unowned bedroom upon sleeping in it. The player can also manually assign bedrooms ([[File:UI add worker.png|28px]]) or change the ownership from one dwarf to another. Married couples have joint ownership of a single bedroom and sleep in the same bed; [[children|babies]] will also share a bedroom with their mother until they grow into children. Assigning a dwarf a new bedroom will '''not''' un-assign them from their old bedroom(s); if you want them to only have one bedroom, you'll need to track down their old bedroom and un-assign it.

Depending on the [[Zone#Quality_and_value|zone value]], bedrooms get a rank:
{| class = "wikitable"|-
! Name
! Value|-| Meager Quarters| style="text-align:right;"| 0|-| Modest Quarters| style="text-align:right;"| 100|-| Quarters| style="text-align:right;"| 250|-| Decent Quarters| style="text-align:right;"| 500|-| Fine Quarters| style="text-align:right;"| 1000|-| Great Bedroom| style="text-align:right;"| 1500|-| Grand Bedroom| style="text-align:right;"| 2500|-| Royal Bedroom| style="text-align:right;"| 10000|}

===Other furniture===
Other pieces of [[furniture]] placed in the zone (such as [[cabinet]]s and [[coffer]]s) are usable by the dwarf that owns the bedroom.  Owning furniture (especially high-quality furniture) gives dwarves happy [[thought]]s, and cabinets and coffers give them a place to store their possessions.

===Who sleeps where===
[[Military]] dwarves can sleep in the [[barracks]] assigned to their squad, if the option is toggled on said barracks. Dwarves with the [[hunting]] labor enabled will sleep anywhere.

==Design tips==
[[Image:Dwarven_Housing.png|thumb|right|A true dwarf does not care for pretty designs or "privacy". For a dwarf, a bedroom is a hole where he dumps his body for rest and his [[Finished goods|useless crap]] for storage, to never touch again.]]
{{main|Bedroom design}}
The living quarters of a fortress can take up a very large area, and since there will be constant [[traffic]] of dwarves going to and from their bedrooms, it is important to put some thought into the placement of the bedrooms. Simply making a long hall with rooms branching off from it is a simple method, but dwarves living at the end of the hall will have to travel a long time, and there will be a lot of dwarves bumping into each other at the entrance of the hall. Making multilevel living complexes can dramatically reduce the amount of time it takes for dwarves to travel to their bedrooms.

There is no need to build massive palaces for the average dwarf - they will get happy [[thoughts]] just from having a bedroom to claim as their own, though bigger and shinier ones will make them happier. 
* Three tiles gives enough room for a [[bed]], a [[cabinet]], and a [[chest]], everything a dwarf needs. These pieces of furniture do ''not'' block movement.

* Four or more tiles allows the room to hold other furniture or (on [[pedestal]]s) other items that the dwarf may especially [[preference|like]], adding further to their [[Stress#Stress reducers|happiness]], and generally gives more space to create a richer, and thus "better", bedroom.
