'''Repeating''' a task at a [[workshop]] is a method of automating mass production. By using the {{k|q}} menu and selecting a task, the {{k|r}} key can be used to toggle the repeating of a task. Tasks currently set to repeat are marked with a blue '''R'''. If the same workshop has multiple tasks marked as repeat, those tasks will be cycled.

Check your needs from time to time - you don't want to end up with, say, a gazillion rock doors in your stockpiles.
