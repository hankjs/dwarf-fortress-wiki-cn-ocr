'''Adder men''' are [[animal people]] variants of the common [[adder]] who can inhabit a number of [[savage]] [[temperate]] regions. They spawn in groups of 1-5 individuals and retain their base venomous snakes' poisonous bites, [[syndrome|syndromic]] effects being: strong pain in the short-term and swelling, blisters, and nausea in the long. For this reason, it's not recommended that you use these seemingly weak creatures as military practice targets without multiple ranged weapons and/or a complete set of [[armor]]; if your [[dwarf]] can't fight because they're doubled over in pain, they're very likely to be ripped apart by their aggressor. Needless to say, avoid provoking them unless prepared. In terms of size, they are a little over half the weight of the average dwarf.

Like other savage animal people, adder men can join [[civilization]]s, become [[historical figure]]s, appear as [[visitor]]s and be playable in [[adventurer mode]].

Some dwarves [[Preferences|like]] adder men for their ''warning hisses''.

Adder men have nothing to do with [[Adder (Computing)|dwarven computing]], despite what they may say.

<!-- Reference: 'Blackadder', British Broadcasting Corporation sitcom series -->
A particular lineage of adder men are noted for appearing in wildly disparate periods of history, from the [[Age|Age of Myth]] to the [[Age|Age of the goblin]]. Although this lineage possesses no physical venom, they can deliver venomous bites via their [[Legendary]] [[Comedian]] and [[Persuader]] skills. They are invariably accompanied by an exceptionally unhygienic [[Human]] [[Peasant]] companion. This companion, who subsists entirely on raw [[plump helmet]]s, will frequently present the adder man with a ''cunning plan''. 

<!-- Reference: Blackadder II episode 4, "Money" -->
Such adder men, seeking to bolster their [[coin]] [[stockpile]]s, may receive help from a [[noble]], who will enter a [[strange mood]], take over an [[Alchemist's laboratory]] and attempt to construct [[gold]] [[bar]]s. The job order will always fail, filling the workshop with [[miasma]] and producing only a single green [[glob]]. The noble will then take this glob to a [[Jeweler's workshop]] and craft a low-value [[amulet]] from it.
