{{D for Dwarf}}

Clowns are basically unknown in Dwarven culture. This is partially because any kind of recreation besides drinking games are seen as un-dwarvenly, but also because facepaint doesn't work that well with excessive facial hair.

The term "clown" is often used as an anti-spoiler term for [[hidden fun stuff|Hidden Fun Stuff]] by some ''Dwarf Fortress'' players, though its effectiveness is questionable (especially given that "Hidden Fun Stuff" is an anti-spoiler term itself, created by [[Toady One]] himself).
