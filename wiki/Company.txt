Trade '''companies''' are mostly world-gen only entities focused on lucrative trade. Their [[counting house]]s can be found in [[town]]s. In worldgen, traveling merchants and companies piggy-back on the more abstract industry/trade simulation that links most sites. At their peaks, the companies will form multiple trade outposts in other civs along the trade routes to facilitate more cross-civ link formation.

Trade companies are distinct from [[mercenary]] orders, although these are sometimes also called companies.
