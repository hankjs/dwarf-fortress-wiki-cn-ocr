'''Dwarven syrup''' is a cooking ingredient made from [[sweet pod]]s at a [[farmer's workshop]] using the "process plants (barrel)" order and the [[plant processing]] labor.  Five units of dwarven syrup are made from each sweet pod, and one seed per sweet pod will be left over.  Dwarven syrup cannot be eaten in its raw state, but can be made into edible food using [[cooking]].

== Bugs ==

Cooks will only cook syrup and other fluids as a last resort, instead preferring to cook solid foods with solid foods. {{Bug|2393}} For more information, see the [[Kitchen#Bugs|kitchen]] page.
