'''Platypus men''' are [[animal people]] variants of the common [[platypus]] who can be found in [[savage]] [[river]]s. They spawn in groups of 5-10 individuals and are generally content to keep to themselves. Like the common animal, platypus men can inject [[Syndrome|poison]] via kick attacks which causes considerable pain and swelling on the victim, while platypus women lack this ability entirely. In terms of size, they are a little over half the weight of the average [[dwarf]].

Like other savage animal people, platypus men can join [[civilization]]s, become [[historical figure]]s, appear as [[visitor]]s and be playable in [[adventurer mode]].

Some dwarves [[Preferences|like]] platypus men for their ''bizarre appearance'', their ''venomous spurs'', their ''flat tails'', and their ''large bills''.

{{D for Dwarf}}
Contrary to popular rumors, there are no records of any civilization having ever recruited platypus men as [[agent]]s.
