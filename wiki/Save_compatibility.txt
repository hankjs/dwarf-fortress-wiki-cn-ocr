'''Save compatibility''' allows [[save]]s from older versions of ''Dwarf Fortress'' to be played on newer versions of ''Dwarf Fortress''. Generally, ''Dwarf Fortress'' versions are ''backwards-compatible'', which means that older saves can be imported into newer versions without problems. However, many new features and some bug fixes do not apply to older saves. This occurs because the changes affect [[world generation]] or the [[raw file]]s.

Generally, ''Dwarf Fortress'' versions are not forwards-compatible, which means that newer saves ''cannot'' be imported into older versions, with a few exceptions for very minor releases. This is rarely necessary, however; if a newer version introduces a bug that makes the game unplayable, a hotfix for the newer version is usually released shortly after.

Sometimes, a release "breaks save compatibility". This means that all older saves do not work with the release. Save compatibility is usually broken when a new [[version number|major version]] is released, such as 50.01 or 0.40.01. Sometimes, due to save file corruption bugs, save compatibility is broken despite the change made being minor; this is noted in the [[Release information|version list]].

== Premium / Freeware Save Compatibility ==

Saved games created in [[classic]] freeware releases of ''Dwarf Fortress'' are compatible with the [[premium]] edition of ''Dwarf Fortress'' and vice-versa. Saved games created in classic versions prior to v50 are not compatible with post-50 versions and vice-versa. However, [[Release_information/51.11|51.11]] introduced a bug that can prevent classic saves from loading in premium, a work around is to copy <code>data\vanilla\vanilla_music\objects\music_standard.txt</code> from classic to premium.{{bug|13170}}
