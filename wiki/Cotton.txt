'''Cotton''' is an [[aboveground]] [[crop]].  Once harvested, cotton plants may be [[plant processing|processed]] at a [[farmer's workshop]] to produce cotton plant fiber [[thread]].

Cotton seeds can be milled into paste at a [[quern]] or [[millstone]] (like rock nuts, the seeds of the [[quarry bush]]), which in turn can be pressed into cotton seed [[oil]] and a [[press cake]] at a [[screw press]].

Cotton is not to be confused with [[cottongrass]]. While cotton is a harvestable crop, cottongrass is a groundcover grass.

Some [[dwarves]] [[Preferences|like]] cotton plants for their ''flowers''.
