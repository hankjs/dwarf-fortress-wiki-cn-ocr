'''Monitor lizard men''' are humanoid versions of the common [[monitor lizard]] and a [[Creature|species]] of unremarkable [[animal people]], found in [[savage]] [[tropical]] [[forest]]s and plains. They are a little larger than the average adult [[dwarf]], and may pose a threat if confronted by unarmed civilians. They share their animal counterparts' rarity, and no more than 10 of them will spawn in the [[biome]] before they are [[extinct]]. 

Like other savage animal people, monitor lizard men may occasionally join [[civilization]]s, becoming full-fledged citizens who may appear in your fortress as [[visitor]]s or be playable in [[adventurer mode]].

Some dwarves [[Preferences|like]] monitor lizard men for their ''intelligence''.
