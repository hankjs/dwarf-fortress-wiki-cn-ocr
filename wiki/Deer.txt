'''Deer''' are [[Creature|animals]] who can be found in [[temperate]] [[forest]]s and [[taiga]]s, where they appear in groups of 1-4 individuals. Benign and herbivorous, they do little but meander about aimlessly through your surroundings, fleeing from any [[dwarf]] who attempts to confront them and only rarely fighting back. Male deer are distinct for possessing a pair of antlers that can be used for a gore attack, which the females lack entirely. Newborn deer are called ''fawns''.

Deer can be captured in [[cage]] [[trap]]s and [[Animal trainer|trained]] into exotic [[pet]]s. Being a bit over twice the size of a dwarf, they provide a fair amount of returns when [[butcher]]ed, making them a choice for a [[meat industry]]. They're [[Grazer|grazing]] animals after being trained, and as such require a [[pasture]] in order to not die of starvation.

Some dwarves [[Preferences|like]] deer for their ''grace''.
