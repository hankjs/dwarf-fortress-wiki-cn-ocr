'''Prickle berry''' is an inferior [[above ground|aboveground]] [[crop]], similar in that way to [[rat weed]]. It can be [[food|eaten]], [[cooking|cooked]], or [[brewing|brewed]] into [[prickle berry wine]]. However, it is not as [[Alcohol#List_of_alcohol|prized]] (or valuable) as any of the [[underground]] crops.

Some [[dwarves]] [[Preferences|like]] prickle berries for their ''precise thorns''.
