Mannerisms, which are hardcoded and not otherwise placed in the [[raw]]s, give a possibility of a personality quirk being included in each member of a [[caste]]. Words placed with the mannerism token are the strings used in the mannerisms for that particular part (e.g. replacing "finger" with "toe" will give you "when she gets exasperated, she often points and shakes her toe").
