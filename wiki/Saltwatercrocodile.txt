'''Saltwater crocodiles''' are large and aggressive exotic [[Creature|reptiles]]. Found in many [[wetland]] [[biome]]s (including freshwater biomes, despite their name), these creatures have a considerable [[pet]] value and are [[Animal trainer|trainable]]. Though wild saltwater crocodiles generally do not wade far from the [[water]]'s edge, they can be a major hazard to any [[dwarf]] whose job takes him near water. Fortunately, they are hard to provoke and most of the time will not chase your dwarves far.

Saltwater crocodiles have the greatest [[egg]]-laying potential of any animal in the game, with 20-70 eggs per clutch. This makes them ideal animals to use for [[egg production]]. Considering the value of a single crocodile and the benefits of having 100+ tamed crocs watching over your [[dwarves]], a breeding pair can be quite valuable. Taking two years to reach full size, they could power a valuable [[meat industry]] for a patient player. Tame saltwater crocodiles are also excellent animals to put into your [[moat]], as they are amphibious, aggressive towards enemies when trained and most [[goblin]]s do not know how to swim, giving a serious edge to your reptilian guards. They will also NOT attack your dwarves. Putting wild crocodiles into your moat or putting any crocodile into your [[magma]] moat is of course a recipe for [[fun]].

Some dwarves [[Preferences|like]] saltwater crocodiles for their ''strength''.
