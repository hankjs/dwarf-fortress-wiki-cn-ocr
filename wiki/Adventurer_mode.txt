[[File:df_adventurer.jpg|thumb|300px|right|A player-controlled adventurer about to embark on a journey with a somewhat predictable end, not realizing the [[fun]] nature of the game.<br><small>''Art by HonorbruSudoku''</small>]]

'''Adventurer mode''' (also called "Adventure mode" or simply "Adventure") allows you to embark on an [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sandbox_game open world] [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roguelike roguelike] adventure to explore the worlds you have generated. You create a character, or party, from any race playable in that world ([[dwarf]], [[human]], [[elf]], [[goblin]], necromantic [[experiment]], [[animal person]], etc.), then visit any part of the world, where you can learn about what ails the inhabitants, and optionally go on [[quest]]s to end those troubles (or get brutally slaughtered trying).
----

You can venture into the wilderness to discover [[cave]]s, [[cavern]]s, [[shrine]]s, [[lair]]s, abandoned towers ([[Tower_(structure)|mundane]] or [[Tower_(necromancy)|magical]]) (or certain [[Mysterious dungeon|mysterious places]]), [[town]]s, and more. You might even decide to revisit your previously abandoned or retired [[fortress]]es, to reclaim the treasures you once crafted, or catch up with your dwarves on a more... personal level. While building and crafting mechanics exist in [[dwarf fortress mode]], building is not available in the current version of adventure mode and crafting is quite limited without [[User:Valos/Adventurecraft|mods]].

==World selection==

You can play adventure mode in any world that has a [[civilization]] with the {{token|ALL_MAIN_POPS_CONTROLLABLE|entity}} token (which are dwarven civilizations, human civilizations, and elven civilizations).
Each civilization has its own preferred style of settlement:
* Dwarven civs are spread between [[fortress]]es (which are built into the surface, and almost always connect to the underground), [[mountain halls]] (which do not contain a direct connection to the surface, they are accessed through underground tunnels instead), and [[hillocks]] (a loose collection of mounds built into hillsides).
* Elven civs inhabit [[forest retreat]]s.
* Human civs inhabit cities, [[town]]s, and [[castle]]s.
* Goblin civs inhabit [[dark fortress]]es and [[dark pits]].

Any species can be a part of any civilization. A civilization starts with a certain race as its population; over time, other races will join the civilization, as long as they can reach it.

[[Town]]s, [[forest retreat]]s, and [[fortress]]es are currently the only sites with shops and other places to officially buy goods. If you have previously built a fort in the world that you select, your adventurer will be able to go visit it. The activity levels of the fortress will depend on whether you decided to "retire" it or abandon it:
* If retired, you will likely be able to encounter most of the inhabitants from the year of retirement in fortress mode, though likely not at the same level of activity as before.
* If abandoned, the fortress will be considered deserted (''which pretty much means, given you're playing adventure mode'': "'''don't abandon, if you were planning to have any further interaction whatsoever'''").

== Character creation ==
{{main|Adventurer mode character creation}}

=== Race ===

[[Adventurer_mode_gameplay#Party_members|Party members]] can be of any race that is a member of a playable civilization, which usually includes dwarves, elves, humans, goblins, and animal people. More races can be made playable (e.g. [[angel]]s) by [[mission|conquering]] their [[site]]s in fortress mode.

* '''Dwarves''' can enter a [[martial trance]] when fighting multiple foes at once, and can see in the dark. As one of the smaller creatures, they're unable to wear human [[clothing]] and [[armor]], but wear the same [[size]] as elves and goblins.
* '''Elves''' have higher natural speed, and a notably sharper sense of smell. Like dwarves, they wear smaller-sized clothing. They generally start with weaker wooden gear, rather than metal.
* '''Humans''' are larger than the other main races, meaning armor from other civilizations is too small, but that also means they are slightly better in combat.
*'''Goblins''' do not need to eat or drink, possess low light vision like dwarves, and wear the same size armor/clothing as dwarves and elves.
* '''[[Animal person|Animal People]]''' come in various sizes, shapes and abilities, and therefore, may not be able to wear armor sized for the more common races (with some exceptions, that you can find in this [[list of creatures by adult size]]). The very largest of them can be very good in combat, especially if using armor made for them in a player fortress. Some are carnivorous, which limits their food options. You can either play as an animal person from a civilization with an existing population of that species, or you can play as an animal person who only just recently joined civilized society, using the "Intelligent Wilderness Creature" option; however, this option is only available to Ordinary characters.
* '''[[Experiment]]s''' that have joined one of the playable civilizations will also be playable. Experiments do not need to eat, drink or sleep, but otherwise vary in size and details.

=== Civilization ===

The civilization you pick determines which sites you can start from, and what skills and items are available when creating a character, among other things.

* '''Dwarven civilizations''' have access to copper, bronze, iron, silver, and steel equipment, but not two-handed weapons or whips.
* '''Elven civilizations''' only have access to weak wooden equipment, but wild animals will not attack characters who are members of an elven civilization. The only weapons they have are shortswords, longswords, spears, and bows.
* '''Human civilizations''' have access to copper, bronze, iron, and silver equipment, and the widest selection of possible weapons, and can start as a [[hearthperson]]. Generally, you should pick a human civ if you want the intended adventure mode experience.
* '''Outsiders''' are characters that don't start as a member of any civilization. Only humans can be outsiders by default. Playing as an outsider has some initial limitations—they possess no pre-existing relationships or cultural knowledge, such as [[rumor]]s, wildlife, [[art]], [[musical forms]], musical [[instrument]]s, clothing types, etc.; including cultural practices, such as hair styles, or language, which is chosen randomly during character creation, but doesn't carry over in game, so items can't be named. When selecting skills for outsiders during creation, many more skills may be available than would otherwise be if they were part of a civilization. They will also have access to all possible pets (although some cost more character creation points than are available), and weapons and armor made from almost every metal available, including some you cannot normally use. However, they will not have access to any other items, including the very important backpack and waterskin. Be aware that outsiders can't [[claim]] sites unless they become a member of a civilization.

=== Destiny ===

Affects the level of guidance and direction received. All destinies have access to the same world features, with higher destinies providing stronger guidance and starting conditions. Due to current restrictions on starting [[site]]s, some creature types may not be available for higher destinies.
*'''[[Chosen]]:''' Adventurer receives the aid of a [[Deity|supernatural parent or patron]], and all benefits of Hero mode. Requires a market site containing a [[temple]] and a priest, which usually means a human civilization.
*'''Hero:''' Compass directs to nearby sites. Requires a market site.{{verify|doesn't this mean heroes cannot be from dwarven civilizations unless they had conquered certain sites?}} Defaults to hearthperson (called soldier in some civilizations), but can be changed. [[Adventurer_mode_gameplay#Companions|Companion recruitment]] is easier.
*'''Ordinary:''' No guidance, compass, or additional restrictions on character creation.

=== Difficulty ===

Determines the number of starting skill, attribute points, and equipment points.
*'''Hard:''' 15 attribute, 35 skill, 55 equipment
*'''Normal:''' 35 attribute, 95 skill, 255 equipment
*'''Easy:''' 105 attribute, 161 skill, 1255 equipment
The number of skill points is less significant than the number of attribute points, because the time it takes to go from Hard to Easy in skill terms, is much less than what it would take to go from Hard to Easy in attribute terms.

=== Archetypes ===

There are a number of predefined archetypes that an adventurer can select, corresponding to a choice of [[Combat skill|weapon]] or [[performance]] specialization. Selecting an archetype will distribute your [[attribute]] and [[skill]] points accordingly, based on the archetype chosen. All archetypes, besides blank slate, include one level of [[swimmer]] and [[reader]].

Attributes and skills can be further customized after choosing an archetype, either from a sample archetype or from a blank slate.

=== Starting attributes ===

:'' See [[Adventurer mode character creation#Starting attributes|this page]] for more info about adventurer mode starting attributes, or [[Attribute|this page]] for full info about attributes 

A creature has numerous attributes which affect its performance at various tasks, split into physical factors associated with the body, and mental factors associated with the soul.

==== Body ====

*'''Strength''': Improves melee attack damage, damage resistance and encumbrance limits. Increases leg strength to movement velocity, but increased muscle layer mass reduces speed.
*'''Agility''': Improves movement speed, attack velocity and potential attack rate. All combat skills, especially defensive ones, rely on it.
*'''Toughness''': Reduces physical damage inflicted on you, and also relates to defensive combat skills.
*'''Endurance''': Reduces the rate at which the adventurer becomes exhausted—exhaustion progressively penalizes physical skills and rate of movement, to the point of immobility and [[unconscious]]ness.
*'''Recuperation''': Increases the rate of wound healing.
*'''Disease Resistance''': Reduces risk of contracting syndromes (including infection) and the negative effects when active (including alcohol-induced.)

==== Soul ====

Some of these are demonstrably useful for adventure-mode-applicable skills, but the effects of the attributes aren't clearly understood. For ideas on how they may be applied, see [[Attribute#Skills_By_Soul_Attribute|a list of skills organized by attributes.]].

*'''Analytical Ability''': Useful for Tracker, Knapping and Student.
*'''Focus''': Affects Archer, Ambusher, Observer. Makes it easier to become focused from fulfilled [[need]]s.
*'''Willpower''': Affects melee combat (''as in, Fighter''), Crutch Walker and Swimmer to a minor extent. Willpower helps resist the negative effects of status ailments such as Pain, Stunned, Unconscious, and all states of exhaustion and [[food]]/[[Thirst|drink]]/[[sleep]] deprivation.
*'''Creativity''': This influences quality of poems, songs, dances, and crafts.
*'''Intuition''': Helps with Observer, which aids in spotting concealed enemies, ambushes, and identifying attacks from opponents.
*'''Linguistic Ability''': Affects any speaking and writing ability, improves the ability to communicate thoughts and feelings to listeners/readers.
*'''Spatial Sense''': Important - affects combat skills, Ambusher, Crutch Walker, Swimmer, Observer, and Knapping 
*'''Musicality''': Influences the adventurer's ability to perform music and song well.
*'''Kinesthetic Sense''': Affects most combat skills, crutch-walking, swimming and dancing to a greater extent.
*'''Empathy''': Affects social skills, such as Persuader, Flatterer, Judge of Intent, and other Social skills that may not be applicable in adventurer mode.
*'''Social Awareness''': Increases the number of followers you can have at a given [[reputation|fame]] level.
*'''Memory''': Increases how much local area information you can maintain before it begins to be overwritten—important to navigate [[Fortress|fortresses]] and underground mazes.
*'''Patience''': Not useful for players. Determines how well or long a non-player character will tolerate negative dialogue towards them, such as insulting or ignoring them.

=== Starting skills ===

:'' See [[Adventurer mode character creation#Starting skills|this page]] for more info about adventurer mode starting skills, or [[Skills|this]] and [[Combat skill|this]] pages for full info about skills.

Characters from different civilizations will have different sets of skills available at the time of character creation, depending on the civilization that they are from, but keep in mind that almost all starting skills, as well as ones not available at character creation, can be improved through use in-game, with the exception of the Reader skill.

This section will specifically address starting skills as they relate to adventure mode. For a full description of combat skills, see [[Combat skill]].

==== Weapon ====

Includes [[Axeman]], [[Bowman]], [[Crossbowman]], [[Hammerman]], [[Knife user|Knife User]], [[Lasher]], [[Maceman]], [[Pikeman]], [[Spearman]] and [[Swordsman]]. Each skill enables the character to use the appropriate weapon more effectively. Weapons may be chosen on the embark screen before starting an adventure.

Note that different races, particularly dwarves, may have different names for their weapon skills. These [[Creature token#PROFESSION_NAME|names]] are defined in the [[Creature token|creature raws]], as can be seen in the [[Dwarf/raw|dwarf raws]]. For example, a Dwarven crossbowman is called a Marksdwarf, while a Dwarven bowman is called a Bowdwarf.

==== General combat ====

Includes [[Fighter]] and [[Archer]]. These skills improve effectiveness of melee (Fighter) or ranged (Archer) combat, regardless of the weapon used. Fighter skill also improves unarmed combat, Archer also improves [[throw]]ing.

==== Defence skills ====

Including [[Shield user|Shield User]], [[Armor user|Armor User]] and [[Dodger]], these skills improve the character's ability to defend using a shield, armor, or dodging. Starting out with good ability in one (especially Shield User or Armor User) if not all, is strongly advised.

==== Unarmed combat and improvised weapons ====

Including [[Wrestler]], [[Striker]], [[Kicker]], [[Biter]], [[Thrower]] and [[Miscellaneous object user]]; while some of them come in handy at times, they can generally be raised fairly easily in-game, especially Wrestler and Thrower.

==== Movement and awareness ====

Includes [[Observer]], [[Swimmer]], [[Ambusher]], [[Climber]], [[Tracker]] and [[Crutch-walker]].

Observer is hard to train, and adding some points here is advisable. Swimmer is almost impossible to train without at least Novice level, and Adequate level is advised because Adequate swimmers do not drown while stunned.

==== Other ====

Includes [[Knapper]], [[Bone carver]], [[Writer]], [[Carpenter]], [[Persuader]], [[Judge of intent]], [[Flatterer]], [[Musician]], [[Speaker]], [[Poet]], [[Singer]], [[Dancer]], [[Stringed instrumentalist]], [[Wind Instrumentalist]], [[Percussionist]], [[Keyboardist]], [[Reader]] (a Novice level of Reading is required in order to become a [[necromancer]]), [[Butcher]] and [[Wordsmith]].

=== [[Personality]] ===

All the aspects of who an adventurer is as an individual, determining their [[beliefs]], [[needs]], and ultimate [[personality goal|goals]], as well as their tolerance for stimuli like combat, trauma, and death.

=== [[Equipment]], [[mount]]s and [[pet]]s ===

Use the equipment points from difficulty selection to obtain a starting set of equipment and/or pets. After this is completed, you can begin your adventure, or add additional party members, before starting.

== Gameplay ==

{{main|Adventurer mode gameplay}}

=== Common UI concepts ===

{{KeyConventions|3}}

=== [[Adventurer mode gameplay#Moving around|Moving around]] ===

You can move around using {{k|8}} {{k|2}} {{k|4}} {{k|6}} {{k|7}} {{k|9}} {{k|1}} {{k|3}} or {{k|↑}} {{k|↓}} {{k|←}} {{k|→}}. Use {{k|Shift}} + {{k|<}} or {{k|Shift}}+{{key|5}} (num lock off) to ascend up the stairs and {{k|Shift}}+{{k|>}} or {{k|Ctrl}}+{{key|5}} (num lock off) to descend. You can also fast travel—press {{k|T}} to enter fast travel mode and {{k|d}} to exit it. Entering fast travel mode will allow you to move large distances in a single keypress—of course, the same amount of time will go by, and you can also be interrupted (ambushed) while moving in fast travel mode.

=== Status and information ===

{| class="wikitable" style="border:1px solid #ccc;"

|-
| {{k|Space}}
| Advance/Clear Messages

|-
| {{Adv menu icon|z}}
| Status
|}

==== Looking around ====

If you're not sure what a tile is, the {{k|l}}ook command will tell you. In addition to being useful for identifying tiles and creatures, you can also view creatures' equipment and what items are sitting on the ground in a given tile. If in doubt, try the look command:

Move the cursor to the tile you want to look at, using the direction keys and {{k|Shift}}+direction. It's possible to look up and down z-levels (assuming you have line of sight) using the {{k|<}} and {{k|>}} keys. This, for example, allows you to find out if any flying creatures are above you. Hit {{k|Esc}} to exit look mode and go back to movement mode.

==== Messages ====

The game makes frequent use of messages on the screen to tell you what's going on - if there are a lot of these, you may need to use {{k|Space}} to display the rest of the messages that won't fit on the screen. You can always go back and view old messages by pressing {{Menu icon|a}}.

==== Status screen ====

This screen shows your skills, attributes, wounded body parts, health (along with more detailed descriptions of your wounds), lets you view your description, and change your nickname if you want.

==== Saving the game ====

Hit the {{Menu icon|Esc}} key at any time and select {{DFtext|Save Game}} to save your game, so you can come back later by using the {{DFtext|Continue Playing}} option in the main menu.

=== Searching and manipulating ===

{| class="wikitable" style="border:1px solid #ccc;"
|-
| {{k|u}}
| Interact with building, furniture, or mechanism
|-
| {{Adv menu icon|L}}
| Search the nearby area very carefully
|}

The {{k|u}} key can be used to do stuff like pull levers in an abandoned fort, or lower and raise the bucket when standing right next to a well; so you can get water to refill your waterskin with.

{{Adv menu icon|L}} will perform a thorough search of the area that you're standing in, possibly revealing some [[Vermin|small creatures]].

=== [[Adventurer mode gameplay#Managing equipment|Managing equipment]] ===

{| class="wikitable" style="border:1px solid #ccc;"
|-
| {{Adv menu icon|i}}
| Show Inventory
|-
| {{Adv menu icon|d}}
| Drop an item
|-
| {{Adv menu icon|g}}
| Get (pickup) an item off the ground
|-
| {{Adv menu icon|p}}
| Put an item into a container
|-
| {{Adv menu icon|r}}
| Remove an item you are wearing or from a container
|-
| {{Adv menu icon|w}}

| Interact with an object in an advanced way (unstick a [[weapon]], refill a [[waterskin]], etc.).
|-
| {{Adv menu icon|q}}
| Sheath your weapons and shield (frees your hands for tasks such as climbing or grabbing). 
|}

Press {{Adv menu icon|i}} to display a list of what you are currently carrying. Press {{k|-}} {{k|+}} {{k|*}} {{k|/}} to scroll through the list—it will show you if items are being worn, held in the hands, stuck on your body, or are inside a container. Detailed information about an object can be viewed by pressing the key associated with the item.

You can {{Adv menu icon|d}} drop items out of your inventory, as well as {{Adv menu icon|g}} get items on the ground, on the same tile that you are standing on. If there is more than one item, a menu will be listed. Press {{k|-}} {{k|+}} {{k|*}} {{k|/}} to scroll the list if it is too long to fit on the screen. Note that getting something makes your adventurer pick it up with their hands—this often means that you have to use {{Adv menu icon|q}} to sheathe whatever you have in your hands, before you pick something up. If you do not have a backpack, or some other way of storing the object, your adventurer will not pick the item up.

Items can be placed into containers with {{Adv menu icon|p}} and removed with {{Adv menu icon|r}}, or be worn using {{Adv menu icon|w}} and removed using {{Adv menu icon|r}} (the same command used for removing from containers).

There is no command for wielding items such as [[weapon]]s in specific hands. Instead, they are automatically equipped when you either {{Adv menu icon|g}} get them from the ground or {{Adv menu icon|r}} remove them from your [[backpack]]—provided the hand that would wield them is free. (You only require free hands to equip weapons on the ground—you can remove any number of items from your backpack and equip them all in the same hand.)

Carrying too much weight in a character's inventory will cause them to move slower the more they carry beyond their limits. When this happens, an icon appears above the inventory icon. Movement speed is reduced based on how much you exceed your carrying capacity, it will never reach zero however, even if you are carrying hundreds of units above your carrying capacity. Stronger, larger characters are able to carry more.

The {{Adv menu icon|q}} key lets you strap your weapons to your back, which is useful, because you can't climb or wrestle with your hands while holding weapons or other objects.

=== [[Adventurer mode gameplay#Time and weather|Time and weather]] ===

You can see the current date ({{k|D}}), temperature ({{k|P}}) and time and weather ({{k|W}}). At night, you won't be able to see nearly as well, and will be more vulnerable to ambush, so it is better to find a shelter before night.

=== [[Adventurer mode gameplay#Sleep|Sleep]] ===

{| class="wikitable" style="border:1px solid #ccc;"
|-
| {{Adv menu icon|Z}}
| Sleep/wait
|}

Eventually, your character will become drowsy, and this will get worse until you get sufficient [[sleep]]. 

As of 0.47.01, bogeymen are restricted to two kinds of evil regions, but you can still be ambushed by wildlife if you are not sleeping in a safe location (castle, building, abandoned lair).

=== [[Adventurer mode gameplay#Eat and drink|Eat and drink]] ===

{| class="wikitable" style="border:1px solid #ccc;"
|-
| {{Adv menu icon|e}}
| [[Eat]] or [[drink]] something
|}

To find water, you must find a [[river]] or stream, or a [[well]] in a town, and fill your waterskin (or any container) from it, or drink from it directly. You can also pick up snow and melt it by interacting with a campfire, fill containers from barrels of booze in human taverns, lick the blood of your enemies from your weapon, or, in dire straits, even drink your own tears.

=== Combat ===

{{main|Combat#Adventurer mode}}

{| class="wikitable" style="border:1px solid #ccc;"
|-

Combat includes attacking with or without weapons, aiming attacks, wrestling, archery, throwing, charging, jumping, dodging, blocking, and parrying. See the main article for details, this is just a summary of the keys.

Hostile creatures can be attacked simply by moving towards them using the movement keys. Any visible creature can be attacked by standing next to it and pressing {{k|A}}. (Attacking some creatures will require confirmation, given using  {{k|alt}}+{{k|y}}. This brings up a menu that may offer options to attack, wrestle, parry, block, or dodge.)

With a ranged weapon equipped (bow, crossbow, etc.) press the {{k|f}} key to fire it. Similarly, use the {{k|t}} key to throw any object in your inventory. Just like {{k|l}}ooking, you can aim at enemies on different Z-levels. It is possible to aim for specific body parts with ranged or thrown attacks.

Jumping at an enemy with {{Adv menu icon|j}} can send them flying, or cause them to dodge, either of which could be useful if they're next to a pit.

During gameplay (not in fast travel mode), you can press {{Adv menu icon|C}} to open the [[Combat#Combat_preferences|Combat Preferences menu]]. There are three different preferences you can set: Attack, Dodge and Charge Defense.

=== Talking ===

{{main|Talking}}

You can talk with people—to begin a conversation or performance, press {{Adv menu icon|k}}, and unless someone else has already started a conversation with you (see below if someone has), you will get a cyan X that can be positioned over people you want to talk to with the normal directional keys—use {{k|-}} and {{k|+}} to select who you want to talk to. Aside from individuals, you can also {{DFtext|Shout out to everybody}}, which will have you talking with everyone in earshot, or you can talk to your deity, or even {{DFtext|Begin Performance}} which includes such things as reciting poetry, telling stories, or dancing, and is very important if you want to be a bard.  After starting conversation, you can trade, take quests, ask for the location of someone or something, ask the listener to join you, etc.

('''Note that you can press {{k|Esc}} to not choose anything—the conversation is still ongoing, you have to explicitly say goodbye to end it. Pressing {{k|Esc}} is useful if you need to double-check something before talking.''')

=== Companions ===

{{main|Adventurer mode gameplay#Companions}}

=== [[Adventurer mode gameplay#Personal finance|Personal finance]] ===

In human towns (not hamlets or castles), you can find shops; in elven trading-trees, markets; and at [[depot]]s in dwarven fortresses, [[broker]]s. Once you're inside of a [[shop]] and right next to any of the NPCs (it doesn't have to be anyone who actually works there), you can use {{Adv menu icon|k}} to {{DFtext|Trade}} with them. 

Use {{K|Enter}} to select which items to trade, left/right arrow keys to switch between the list of shop items and your items, and up/down arrow keys to scroll through the lists. Once done, press {{K|t}} to trade. After trading, you will find the stuff you gave on the floor at your feet, and the stuff you got in your inventory. Exchanging items with NPCs who are not in a store works similarly, except they try to take the items from you and equip them/put them in their inventory. Emphasis on ''try'', because if they have no storage containers/cannot (or simply don't want to, as is often the case when giving companions armor) equip the item, they will drop it on the floor. However, since you are not within the confines of a store, these items are no longer considered theirs and you are free to take them back, effectively allowing you to make 100% profit, if you know what you're doing.

You may also pick up the item before buying it, but you should never walk out of a shop carrying an unbought item, as that is theft (of the type people care about. Most methods of acquiring items in adventure mode are labeled as "theft" in legends or rumors, but if the item isn't marked as for sale, nobody cares). This is punishable by death if you are caught, and exile if you are not. 

On any occasion when you have stolen goods from a store (indicated by dollar signs on either side of the item in your inventory), the game requires you to exit the site ''and'' move a considerable distance before allowing you to quick travel. If the item name is not surrounded by dollar signs, it is never considered stealing, even in situations where it would be in real life. Very few items are actually capable of being 'stolen', normally limited to whatever is on display in someone's shop (thus, dollar signs as noted above). One of the very few exceptions to this is dwarven fortresses, where there will be a large number of stockpiles underground with items you can't take.

Coins can and will encumber your adventurer, eventually reducing your speed - to reduce that effect, you can try to exchange your copper and silver coins for gold ones, as well as sell all of your loot directly for gold coins.

Coins from one civilization are nearly worthless in others. You can take your excess coinage and use it to purchase [[Gem|large gems]] at a trinket shop. Large gems make good investments because they are 1) light, 2) variably priced, and 3) equally valuable between different civilizations. However, be sure to check the value of gems before taking them—some gems, such as [[green jade|jade]]s or [[pyrite]] are virtually worthless and have a less efficient value/weight ratio than your average sock. If possible, carry your gemstones around in the form of jewel-encrusted clothing, as that is not only more valuable than the sum of its parts, but decorations have no weight and cloth is very light.

If you aren't interested in wasting carrying capacity on worthless trinkets when you could be lugging around actual valuables (like the corpses of your enemies), but also don't want to murder literally everybody who has something you want, actual straight-up theft is possible. Basically, by [[wrestling]], grabbing an item with either of your hands, and {{k|I}}nteracting with it to gain possession; you can take any item from someone's inventory that you desire. Normally, this would count as an assault, but remember, it's not a crime if nobody sees you do it. To minimize the chances of getting caught, you can {{k|S}}neak, which will turn your wrestling attempts into "stealthy grabs", and wait until nightfall to strike—even the clumsiest adventurer is unlikely to wake someone up while sneak-stealing all their clothes. For those who know their way around [[DFHack]], setting your character's sparring flag on will just flat-out make people not care, as you rip every piece of masterwork armor off their body in broad daylight, but any companions you may have will take this as an invitation to brutally murder your victim.

=== Quest log ===

| Open quest log
|-
| {{k|Esc}}

The quest log contains everything you know about the world, such as various events going on, people you know, and various sites. The {{k|m}} key will alternate between a world map that you can navigate, and information on whatever item is highlighted in the list to the right.

There are various kinds of lists you can check on the quest log:

* '''Events''' — A list of events that are happening or have happened. Formatting of the list is {{DFtext|(type)/(description)}}. You can center on the location of the event if you know this. This list is the closest you'll get to some formal quest system.
* '''People''' — A list of people you know. At the start of the game, this list will contain people in your site.
* '''Sites''' — A list of various sites around the world.
* '''Groups''' — A list of groups you know of and your relation to them. Note that you have to press {{k|e}} when you're on the events list in order to reach this list, requiring you to press {{k|e}} at most twice.
* '''Agreements''' — Your various agreements; this includes tasks given to you by your lord (if you are a [[hearthperson]]), why people are traveling with you, and the history of your agreements.
* '''Regions''' — A list of regions. The additional information will list the biomes a region possesses.
* '''Bestiary''' — A list of creatures, their characteristics, and where you could find them.

Adventurers can perform limited crafting. To access the crafting menu, press {{k|x}} - you can sharpen rocks, assemble stone axes, carve bones, make wooden furniture, butcher [[corpse]]s, or compose songs or dances (to do that, or write books and scrolls, press {{k|P}}).

Natural abilities (spitting, breathing fire, etc.) and acquired powers (such as raising [[undead]]) are utilized via this menu.

Adventurers can chop down trees for [[wood|resources]]—however, building and site planning are not currently functional. Neither chopping down trees nor constructing sites can be performed in existing locations, such as [[town]]s. Building was originally intended to require wooden logs, which would normally be acquired by chopping down trees. With a ''non-wooden'' axe in hand, pressing {{Adv menu icon|g}} next to a tree would allow you to chop it down.

Previously, site construction planning allowed for persistence between save/load, retire/unretire, or even die/new hero, but this feature no longer exists. The mechanics for assigning a {{k|N}}ame or {{k|z}}ones, such as a main hall, library, or temple, are also no longer available. These features, which were necessary to make sites functional, have been removed.

=== Retirement ===

If you are in a site, you can choose to retire your adventurer from the escape menu, making them a member of the site. 

After any amount of time spent playing other games in the world, you can resume playing as them, as long as they're still alive, by starting a new adventure game and choosing them from the species list. Between games, you can see what retired adventurers have been up to in [[legends mode]], or, if you prefer, [[DF2014:Utilities#Legends_Viewer|Legends Viewer]]. Your adventurer can still do things while retired, including getting involved in some pretty serious combat (Since you've almost certainly given them some decent combat prowess, that combat may very well be assistance in the defence of the site you retired them in, which is one way they can get killed - if you're hoping to be able to unretire your adventurer later, simply put, it might be best to '''avoid retiring in a region of the world where people constantly mention armies on the march'''). Retirement may also be used as a sort of "panic button" if you want to save the life of a favorite character who has gotten into a fight they have no hope of winning, since offloading sites can heal a lot of otherwise-fatal wounds and conditions that block all methods of offloading sites, outside of retirement.
