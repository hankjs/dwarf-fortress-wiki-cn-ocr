The '''outpost liaison''' is a special [[Dwarf|dwarven]] [[noble]] responsible for coordinating [[Trade agreement|trade agreements]] with the capital. Once your fortress becomes the mountainhome, the liaison will [[Immigration|migrate]] to it alongside the [[monarch]]. They possess moderate [[Zone#Quality_and_value|room]] requirements. When a liaison visits with information of any kind to share, the following icon will appear:<br>
[[File:diplomacy_icon_anim.gif|88px]]

The outpost liaison lives at the mountainhome and visits your fortress at the same time as the dwarven [[caravan]]. The liaison will first bring news about events that happened elsewhere during the year, such as [[noble]] appointments or reclamation expeditions. The liaison will then seek to draw up a trade agreement: you'll be asked to indicate your demand for all the different kinds of goods; this will cause prices to be quoted, and will strongly influence the contents of next year's caravan.  In return, the liaison will indicate the prices that will be paid for goods the dwarven civilization particularly desires (you are not obligated to trade any of those items). Also to note, after you make trade agreements they can be viewed in the civ screen. If you have satisfied the requirements for becoming a barony, the liaison will also grant you the opportunity to appoint a [[baron]]; upon satisfying the requirements for becoming a county or duchy, the liaison will also promote your baron to a [[count]] or [[duke]]. Note that these appointments/promotions only occur if the liaison leaves the map alive. 

In the event that your leader is replaced, killed or taken by a [[strange mood]], the liaison may decide to leave your fortress [[stymied|"unhappy"]].{{bug|576}} Curiously, this will '''not''' occur if your leader is otherwise unable to perform the "conduct meeting" task. You can currently lock a liaison in a room and he will wait years to attend a meeting (and all subsequent diplomats appear to wait in line for the first to finish); this behavior is presumably a bug.{{bug|8947}}

An unhappy liaison will naturally prevent you from creating trade agreements, however it is not currently known what other effects this has on relations with the mountainhome. Whether the liaison successfully met with your leader or just gave up, a liaison who has decided to leave but is prevented from reaching the map edge will eventually go [[insane]].

If the liaison is killed (or permanently detained), a new liaison will arrive the following year. It should be noted that you can order the Liaison to be killed through the "[[squads]]" screen, however, doing so will trigger a [[loyalty cascade]].

The outpost liaision will usually leave the map after conduction its meeting, but the outpost liaision might linger around, if the outpost liaision does not have any dwarf (of the fortress) at least as a passing acquaintance. In the later case the outpost liasion will leave after talking to any fortress citizen (and gaining a fortress citizen as a passing acquaintence).

The liaison's title does not change according to your [[fortress]]'s status.

If your civilization does not currently have an appointed liaison (or if the liaison is already inside your fortress) you will receive this message in a lovely red text: {{dftext|No outpost liaison? How curious...|4:1}} &nbsp; If your civilization is truly [[extinct]], however, you will not receive this message.

== Human trade representatives ==
Some [[Human|human]] civilizations will send a trade representative to your fortress along with the caravan to negotiate trade agreements (they have the {{token|TRADE|po}} token). This representative will have a procedurally generated job title, but will always greet you in the name of the merchant guild. Beyond this, the trade agreement works the same as the dwarven one. This offers opportunities like being able to ask for goods dwarves will normally not have access to, such as [[Weapons#Foreign weapons|foreign weapons]] or tamed [[grizzly bear]]s. On the other hand, clothing and armor supplied by the humans will be human-sized, and they do not have access to [[steel]].

The Human trade representative does not visit as regularly as the outpost liaison. Trading large amounts of goods, offering valuable goods, and giving the humans profitable trades all seem to incentivize the arrival of the trade representative{{verify}}.

== Bugs ==
* The outpost liaison will occasionally just hang out in the tavern and never bother to meet with anyone.{{bug|9262}}
