The '''furniture industry''' deals with the creation and disposition of [[furniture]], which is any item that is stored in a [[stockpile|furniture stockpile]]. Furniture can be made from a very broad range of materials: [[wood]], [[stone]], [[metal]], [[glass]], and [[cloth]] or [[leather]] for bags ([[artifact]] furniture may be made out of unusual materials such as [[bone]]). The wide variety of options can at first be confusing and intimidating to many players, but in time you will appreciate the tremendous flexibility and potential this approach brings to the game, both for aesthetic and practical purposes. Many players are inspired to [[stupid dwarf trick|novel approaches]] to fortress placement and [[mega construction|design]].

All furniture has a [[item value|base value]], determined by its item type ([[bed]], [[barrel]], [[anvil]], etc.), which is multiplied by its '''material multiplier''' ([[silver]], [[orthoclase]], [[glumprong]], etc.) and its '''quality modifier''' (fine, exceptional, etc.) to determine its '''final value''' (any '''decorations''' on the furniture are calculated separately and added to the final value). All furniture has both a material multiplier and quality modifier. Quality is dependent on the relative [[skill]] of the dwarf that completes the [[job]] of building the piece of furniture: [[experience|highly skilled]] dwarves will produce higher-quality furniture, increasing your fortress' [[wealth]]. The number and value of furniture in a [[zone|room]] determines the room's value; smaller rooms with more valuable furnishings can be more useful for meeting [[noble]]'s requirements in fortresses where space is an issue.

For ease of reference, the furniture industry is broken down into discussion by basic material ([[wood]], [[stone]], etc.), and then by [[workshop]].

==Wood Furniture==
:''See also: [[Wood industry]]''
[[Wood]] furniture is relatively lighter and more prone to damage than furniture made from stone, metal or glass because wood is both [[fire|combustible]] and, in the case of [[barrel]]s, susceptible to [[vermin]]. The great advantage of wood is its ready accessibility and the tendency of [[tree]]s to regrow over time, making wood a readily renewable resource. Early in the life of a fortress, before the [[metal industry|metal]] or [[glass industry|glass industries]] are up and running, wood is the only material available for the making of [[barrel]]s, an essential storage device for [[food]] and [[booze]]. Barring certain [[artifact]]s, wood remains the only material that can be made into a [[bed]] or [[siege engine]]s.

For most purposes, different types of wood are interchangeable. However, certain exotic woods have properties that make them more or less suitable for different types of furniture. For example, [[feather tree]] wood is the lightest wood in the game, and ideal for furniture that needs to be moved often such as [[bucket]]s - but it is the worst wood in the game to make [[ballista arrow]]s from, because ballista arrow damage is determined by [[weight]]. Ideally, ballista arrows should be made from the heaviest woods in the game: [[glumprong]] or [[blood thorn]].

Most woods are brown, and produce brown furniture. However, exotic woods can be used to make red ([[goblin-cap]]), crimson ([[blood thorn]]), white ([[tower-cap]], [[feather tree]]), yellow ([[fungiwood]]), teal ([[spore tree]]), indigo ([[nether-cap]]), black ([[black-cap]]), purple ([[glumprong]]), or violet ([[tunnel tube]]) wooden furniture.

===Carpenter's Workshop===
The [[carpenter's workshop]] is used to make most wooden furniture, and requires a dwarf with the [[carpentry]] labor enabled. One [[log]] is consumed to make each item of wooden furniture. The following furniture can be made at a carpenter's workshop: [[armor stand]], [[barrel]], [[bed]], [[bin]], [[bucket]], [[cabinet]], [[casket]], [[door]], [[floodgate]], [[grate]], [[hatch cover]], [[table]], [[throne]], [[weapon rack]].

===Siege Workshop===
The [[siege workshop]] is used to produce [[siege engine|catapult parts]], [[siege engine|ballista parts]] and [[ballista arrow]]s, and requires a dwarf with the [[siege engineer]] labor enabled. One [[log]] is consumed to make either siege engine part or one ballista arrow.

==Stone Furniture==
:''See also: [[Stone industry]]''
[[Stone]] furniture is heavy and durable when compared to [[wood]], can be used to make most items of furniture, and vast quantities of rough stone are made available by [[mining]] on most maps, making it the staple furniture material of most dwarf fortresses. It is not as versatile as [[metal]] or [[glass]], but it also consumes no [[fuel]] to make an item of furniture.

Some stones, notably [[graphite]], are quite [[fire|combustible]] and any furniture made from such materials should not be located near [[magma]], [[fire snake]]s, [[fire imp]]s, [[dragon]]s, or any other source of [[fire]]. Other stones are designated as [[magma-safe]], and furniture made from such materials will be [[fire-safe]] as well.

Particularly valuable [[economic stone]]s are designated as prohibited for general use by [[mason]]s and the like for making stone furniture or crafts, being reserved for the [[furnace]]s. In some cases, however, it might be desirable or necessary to make furniture from economic stone. A noble might demand a [[native silver]] [[table]] for their room, or other magma-safe materials being exhausted a [[bauxite]] [[floodgate]] might be necessary to control the magma flow. [[Native gold]] is a peculiar case where the [[ore]] has the same [[material value]] as [[gold|gold metal]], and making furniture directly from native gold can save both time and [[fuel]] (though at a 25% reduction in total value). Whatever the case, if you do desire to make use of economic stone in furniture, you must do so from the [[Labor#Stone use|Stone use tab]] in the Labor menu {{menu icon|y}}.

It is recommended that you create one or more stone [[stockpile]]s near your [[workshop]]s to minimize the distance between the two; a dwarf will typically grab the rough stone nearest the workshop when fulfilling a [[job]] to craft stone furniture (without the benefit of [[wheelbarrow]]s). You can also link a specific stone stockpile to a workshop to ensure your dwarf grabs stone from that stockpile and prevent other dwarves from using it.

===Stoneworker's Workshop===
The [[Stoneworker's workshop]] is used to make most stone furniture, and requires a dwarf with the [[masonry]] labor enabled. One unit of rough [[stone]] is consumed in making each item of stone furniture. The following furniture can be made at a Stoneworker's workshop: [[armor stand]], [[cabinet]], [[chair]], [[chest]], [[coffin]], [[door]], [[floodgate]], [[grate]], [[hatch cover]], [[millstone]], [[quern]], [[statue]], [[table]], [[weapon rack]], [[slab]].

===Mechanic's Workshop===
The [[mechanic's workshop]] is used to make [[mechanism]]s and [[traction bench]]es, and requires a dwarf with the [[mechanic]] labor enabled. One unit of rough stone is consumed in making each mechanism. Mechanisms that are going to be used in [[magma]] [[floodgate]]s or the like should be made from [[magma-safe]] materials.

==Metal Furniture==
:''See also: [[Metal industry]]''
[[Metal]] furniture is even more durable than [[stone]], and can be used to make a wider variety of furniture. Crafting metal furniture requires not only [[bar]]s of metal but [[fuel]] for the forge or access to [[magma]]. Metal furniture made from [[adamantine]], [[platinum]], [[aluminum]], [[gold]], and [[steel]] are the most [[item value|valuable]] in the game, based solely on material multiplier (quality modifiers and [[decoration]]s will vary). [[Barrel]]s made from metal, even low-value metals like [[nickel]] or [[lead]], are significantly more effective at keeping [[vermin]] from [[wear|gnawing]] at food supplies.

Metals with low melting points like [[copper]] and its [[alloy]]s are not [[magma-safe]] and should not be used to make furniture that will contact [[magma]].

Like with wood or stone, you may specify the precise type of metal used to make an item of metal furniture, although with metal it is selected while creating the task instead of afterward.  It may still be a good idea to adjust the [[manager|workshop profile]] to restrict certain workshops and their associated tasks to your most [[experience]]d [[blacksmith]]s, and schedule practice with low-value metals before attempting to create high-value furniture. Also, a blacksmith with a [[preference]] for a particular metal or type of furniture will produce higher-quality results when working with that metal or creating that type of furniture.  

===Metalsmith's Forge===
The [[metalsmith's forge]] and [[magma forge]] are used to make all metal furniture, and requires a dwarf with the [[blacksmith]] labor enabled. Three [[bar]]s of the specified [[metal]] is consumed in making most items of metal furniture; a metalsmith's forge will also consume one unit of [[fuel]] per [[job]]. The following furniture can be made from any metal at a forge: [[armor stand]], [[barrel]], [[bin]], [[bucket]], [[cabinet]], [[chest]], [[door]], [[floodgate]], [[grate]], [[hatch cover]], [[coffin|sarcophagus]], [[statue]], [[table]], [[throne]], [[weapon rack]].

[[Copper]], [[silver]], [[bronze]], [[bismuth bronze]], [[iron]], [[steel]], and [[adamantine]] may be made into [[mechanism]]s; this option is under the "Trap Components" option.

[[Iron]], [[steel]], and [[adamantine]] may be made into [[anvil]]s; this option is under the "Other Objects" option.

Despite being listed under furniture at the forge, [[chain]]s, [[animal trap]]s, [[cage]]s, [[pipe section]]s, [[splint]]s, [[crutch]]es, and [[block]]s are ''not'' furniture. They do not require the blacksmith labor to create, and they do not go into the furniture [[stockpile]] once created.

==Glass Furniture==
:''See also: [[Glass industry]]''
[[Glass]] furniture is comparable to [[stone]] furniture in most respects, but has a higher [[value|material multiplier]] than ordinary stone ([[economic stone]] is another matter entirely). Making glass furniture requires not only [[sand]], but access to [[fuel]] or [[magma]]. However, a [[magma glass furnace]] and a sand layer can produce an infinite amount of [[green glass]] furniture without consuming any materials whatsoever.

Glass is [[magma-safe]] and glass furniture can be placed in contact with [[magma]].  Since it is essentially free once you have access to magma, this is quite useful when planning extensive projects.

===Glass Furnace===
The [[glass furnace]] and [[magma glass furnace]] are used to make all glass furniture, and requires a dwarf with the [[glassmaker]] labor enabled. One unit of [[sand]] is consumed in making each item of green glass furniture, while Clear Glass consumes sand and [[pearlash]], and Crystal Glass consumes [[rock crystal]] and pearlash; a glass furnace will also consume one unit of [[fuel]] per job. The following furniture can be made from any glass at a furnace: [[armor stand]], [[box]], [[cabinet]], [[coffin]], [[floodgate]], [[grate]], [[hatch cover]], [[door|portal]],  [[statue]], [[table]], [[throne]], [[weapon rack]], [[window]].

==Cloth Furniture==
:''See also: [[Textile industry]]''
[[Cloth]] [[bag]]s are counted as furniture and will be normally be deposited in the furniture [[stockpile]]{{verify}}, unless they are used as [[Storage|container]]s for [[seed]]s, [[flour]] and the like. [[Giant cave spider]] silk cloth is the most valuable in the game, and it may be wise to designate a special [[stockpile]] and [[workshop]] for working with it, [[manager|restricted]] to your most highly skilled clothesmaker to ensure a higher [[value|quality modifier]].

===Clothier's Shop===
The [[clothier's shop]] is used to make cloth bags, and requires a dwarf with the [[clothesmaking]] labor enabled. One unit of the specified cloth ([[silk]], [[yarn]] or [[plant]]) will be consumed in making each bag.

==Leather Furniture==
:''See also: [[Meat industry]]''
[[Leather]] [[bag]]s are counted as furniture and will be normally be deposited in the furniture [[stockpile]], unless they are used as [[Storage|container]]s for [[seed]]s, [[flour]] and the like. You cannot designate the specific type of leather used to make a bag, and leather from rare and dangerous creatures can be particularly [[value|valuable]], so it may be wise to designate a special [[stockpile]] and [[workshop]] for working with it, [[manager|restricted]] to your most highly skilled leatherworker to ensure a higher [[value|quality modifier]].

[[Giant cave spider]]s and [[giant desert scorpion]]s give [[chitin]] instead of leather, and it cannot be made into bags.

[[Dragon]] and [[fire imp]] leather appear to be [[magma-safe]], and any bags made from them should be magma-safe as well. This can be a bad thing if such an object gets stuck in, say, a [[floodgate]] that is letting a torrent of [[magma]] through.

===Leather Works===
The [[leather works]] is used to make leather bags, and requires a dwarf with the [[leatherworking]] labor enabled. One unit of the leather will be consumed in making each bag.

==Decorating Furniture==
Furniture can be [[decorate]]d by many different materials so as to improve its [[value]], record the history of the fortress, and give dwarves happy [[thought]]s from looking at them. Furniture will only be decorated if it is in a stockpile, not while it is currently in use. To ensure a given piece of furniture gets decorated, designate a special [[stockpile]] for the furniture near the [[workshop]] and link it to the workshop (make sure the dwarf can still access the raw materials for the decoration by linking that stockpile as well).

==Buying and Selling Furniture==
Furniture is generally heavy and will diminish how much you can [[trade]] with the [[caravan]]s when they arrive; well-crafted and decorated furniture made from valuable materials will get you more bang for your [[currency|dwarfbuck]]. Trading in [[booze]], [[leather]], [[cloth]], [[flour]], and the like usually results in a certain amount of exchange in [[barrel]]s, [[bag]]s, and [[bin]]s. Beware trading [[elves]] any piece of furniture derived from [[wood]], as this may start a [[war]]. Dwarven and [[human]] caravans will occasionally carry [[anvil]]s.
