[[File:v50_surroundings_preview.png|450px|right]]'''Surroundings''' affect the types of [[crop|plant]] life, native [[creatures]] and wild [[ambience]] which will appear in play within a given [[biome]]. The surrounding type is formed of two components: spirit and savagery. It is possible to start a [[fortress]] that overlaps multiple alignment types (for example, a terrifying [[forest]] and a calm [[shrubland]]). Some players consider this desirable, as it provides diversity in your little corner of the world, but it also has its dangers in the form of more ferocious wildlife.

Some plants and animals are unique to a certain type of surroundings and will only be found if those surroundings are present on the map. Note that most creatures also require a specific [[climate]] to spawn in. Again, it's important to check the specific biomes making up your site. Once a [[creature]] spawns on the map, it is under no compulsion to stay in its own biome and can roam as it pleases. Because of this, the specifics of what means what can be difficult to pin down sometimes.

[[Cavern]]s are not affected by alignments, despite some subterranean creature definitions including an alignment. Good creatures like the [[gorlak]], evil creatures like the [[troll]] and savage creatures like the [[giant cave spider]] can be found in any cavern, regardless of whether the fortress is settled in good/evil/savage surroundings or not.

Selecting surroundings is one way to change the [[difficulty]] of the game. Surroundings may be removed in the 'Myth & Magic' update.<sup>[http://www.bay12forums.com/smf//index.php?topic=169696.msg8341484#msg8341484]</sup>

== Combinations & characteristics of surroundings ==
The names given to different areas will reflect their moral standing. For example, good biomes may be named "The Hills of Sweetness" while an evil one may be named "The Prairie of Agony". Neutral biomes will generally have more generic names, such as "The Beige Jungles". Not all worlds will contain every kind of combinations. For example, a world that is low in savagery may not contain Joyous Wilds surroundings.

[[File:good_biome_v50.png|thumb|120px|left|A sharp green good biome.]]'''Good''' biomes tend to have less aggressive (often {{token|BENIGN}}) and weaker [[creatures]], except for the [[unicorn]]. They also tend to have more [[fanciful]] creatures than neutral biomes. Good regions also support the wild [[sun berry]], which makes the best [[alcohol]] in the game. There are generally slight changes between ''Benign Good'' and ''Savage Good''. Though these biomes are the safest in the game, they can still come with a challenge. Therefore, players should still not be too complacent.

Good biomes will appear to have more vibrant colors than their neutral and evil counterparts, and may also have yellow flowers. Good savage biomes will have pink flowers instead. Frozen areas will have a sparkle to them. In ASCII mode, good regions will appear as blue.

[[File:neutral_biome_v50.png|thumb|120px|left|A generic, neutral biome.]]'''Neutral''' regions are the easiest to understand. They generally mimic the real world, with recognizable wildlife.  They can be quite dangerous depending on the region, holding anything from benign and weak weasels, to the generally non-aggressive but physically powerful [[elephant]]s, to the very aggressive and very dangerous [[giant eagle]]s. As one might expect, ''Benign Neutral'' zones are really very safe, while ''Savage Neutral'' areas can pose some major difficulties, depending on the dominating climate, landforms, [[giant badger|or]] [[giant kea|wildlife]]. You'll find most of the standard aboveground plants in these alignments, such as [[prickle berry|prickle berries]], [[rope reed]], [[strawberry|strawberries]] and the like.

[[File:bad_biome_v50.png|frame|left|Dark brown patch of an evil biome.]]'''Evil''' regions are much more dangerous and strange than their ''Neutral'' and ''Good'' counterparts across the board. First, in addition to the ordinary wildlife native to the biome, various other [[creatures]] that are nasty, dangerous, and spiteful such as [[beak dog]]s, [[harpy|harpies]], and [[ogre]]s can be found in evil regions.

Evil regions may exist either on their own (where they are known as "primordial" evil regions) or they may be caused by the presence of [[demon]]s or [[necromancer]]s ruling over a [[site]] in it (known as "circumstantial" evil regions). An evil region possesses [[sphere]]s associated with the entities, if any, inhabiting it, which influences the surroundings to some extent. E.G: Blight, death, and disease regions kill plant life, while nightmare regions are home to [[Bogeyman|bogeymen]]. Primordial evil areas are eternal, but circumstantial evil regions may fade away if there is no activity in the area, making it possible to revert it back to normal. Presumably, slaying the demons or necromancers responsible for the corruption is the way to do so.

Most evil regions have associated evil [[weather]]. Evil clouds can inflict various [[syndrome]]s on par with those of [[forgotten beast]]s, or instantly transform creatures into freakishly powerful [[Undead#Thralls, Husks, and_Zombies|thralls]].  Evil rains may also inflict random evil syndromes, albeit less severe ones, and always cause unhappy [[thought]]s and a desire to wash (evil!). Evil rain won't refill pools, but a single evil biome may have both evil and regular rain, even at the same time. Putrid slime or other disgusting muck may be covering the area.

About half of all evil regions are "reanimating", meaning that all wildlife and plantlife will be [[undead]], and any creature that dies will, after a short time, be reanimated as undead. Undead are hostile to all living creatures, and feel no fear or pain. In general, undead wildlife is '''extremely''' dangerous, especially in Terrifying regions, since the undead may include zombified fliers that swoop down and rip your dwarves to shreds with little to no warning at all, and even discounting those, typically harmless creatures like [[beaver]]s will turn out to be necro-buffed monstrosities that are out for all living blood. 

Undead can only be killed in [[combat]] by beheading, bisection, or pulping damage, or otherwise by [[Butcher|butchering]], [[Cave-in|cave-ins]], [[Dwarven atom smasher|particle physics]], or good old fashioned [[Magma|magma]]. Beheading, bisection and butchering may leave remains that can be reanimated; any partial corpse or body part that is not "mangled" and contains at least one hand or head can reanimate. This includes [[skin]], and even [[hair]] left over from butchering or shearing. Remains can reanimate while your dwarves are processing them, frightening any nearby dwarves and canceling job orders. That being said, reanimated hair is not much of a threat and your dwarves will likely quickly dispatch them. The resulting mangled remains can still be processed just like the original material, but without the risk of job cancellations. {{clear}}

Creatures that can [[Building destroyer|destroy buildings]], [[Trapavoid|avoid traps]] or [[Steals items|steal items]] will retain these abilities in undeath. Undead do not need to breathe, so they will not be stopped by rivers or moats, and aquatic undead can and will come ashore. Furthermore, the usual strategy of dealing with wildlife by avoiding confrontation is impossible since the undead will always stay in a state of "perpetually murderous towards all living beings" no matter how much you decide to bother them. Maybe a [[vampire]] or [[necromancer]] can help?

If your [[Embark|embark]] site spans multiple biomes then only the evil part will have the reanimating effect, and only wildlife appearing from that side will be undead. The reanimating effect extends all the way underground. The trees at embark may all be dead, and though they can be cut down for logs, will not regrow. Undead shrubs are useless for [[Herbalist|gathering]], too. 

When embarking in a reanimating evil region, it is advised to move everything underground as soon as possible, and immediately set up plenty of [[trap]]s and/or a [[military]] armed with blunt weapons. Be very careful with [[refuse]] stockpiles and butcher's shops. Keep livestock to a minimum, as they are a liability. Needless to say, hunting is a very bad idea. 

Evil regions are so inhospitable that beginners might find evil surroundings—even ''Benign Evil''—too difficult. Still, players may wish to embark in such surroundings for <s>a challenge</s> [[fun]].

Evil regions can appear on the map as either dark brown or a dim sandy brown. Ice will also appear more dim. Savage evil areas may show more wormy tendrils. In ASCII mode, evil areas can appear as magenta, grey and red; brown can be seen in ocean and lake areas. There is no functional difference between these regions.

: ''So, in ASCII, for most regions (not oceans apparently), there's a special variable that says whether an evil region is gray-red, or light/dark magenta.  It defaults to zero, which is the magenta version, but when the "evilify" region function is called, it is randomized from 0-1.  There's also a version of this function used for circumstantially evil areas, and it appears to also set the variable from 0-1.  If either of those things aren't working, then the colors would probably all be magenta.''

===Savage===
: Including {{DFtext|Untamed Wilds|6:1}}, {{DFtext|Joyous Wilds|3:1}} and {{DFtext|Terrifying|5:1}}

'''Savage''' surroundings are the only surroundings which have [[giant animal|giant]] and [[animal people|humanoid]] versions of some animals. It is also possible that two groups of animals happen outside on a savage biome, instead of one. They are also far more varied in wildlife than the other biomes. Graphically, good savage biomes can have pink flowers, even in barren biomes, while evil savage biomes may show more wormy tendrils. Savage icy, frozen areas will have cracks in the ice. Oceanic savage areas will show more erratic looking waves.

Most of the creatures in savage biomes will leave you alone, especially the animal people, who are harmless (with a few exceptions), and most of the giant creatures will not be hostile, but then again, a savage biome may just surprise you with [[giant kea]]s or [[giant badger]]s, and some of the creatures found in savage biomes are dangerous indeed. "Savage Good" regions are called Joyous Wilds, "Savage Neutral" regions are called Untamed Wilds, and "Savage Evil" regions are called <s>excessively fun</s> Terrifying.

Savage biomes also house [[whip vine]]s, a high-value millable/brewable aboveground crop, and [[highwood]]s, a slow-growing tree that can grow as thick as 3×3.

Animals in savage regions can become ''agitated'', which increases their proactive desire to attack your dwarves; how easily and often this can happen can be adjusted in the [[Difficulty#Wilderness_irritation|difficulty]] [[settings]], or can be [[Difficulty#Individual_enemy_toggles|completely disabled]].

Civilizations, except for [[elf|elves]], who are naturally at peace with animals, typically do not settle in high-savagery regions, which may cause problems during [[world generation]] if the game can't find enough low-savagery regions to place civilizations in.

* Animals: above-ground [[animal people]], [[giant animal]]s, [[sasquatch]], [[sea serpent]], [[yeti]]
* Plants: [[whip vine]]
* Trees: [[highwood]]
* Vermin: [[acorn fly]], [[fox squirrel]], [[moghopper]], [[two-legged rhino lizard]]
