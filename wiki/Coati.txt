'''Coatis''' are small solitary [[creature]]s who inhabit both [[tropical]] and [[temperate]] [[forest]]s. Slightly larger than the average [[cat]], coatis will attempt to steal unguarded [[steals food|food]] and [[steals items|items]] from your fortress, and as such should be kept clear of your [[stockpile]]s. [[Dwarf|Dwarves]] will react aggressively to their presence and you may see your peasants attack and beat them to death without any input on your part, and their small size means they are generally harmless. Newborn coatis are called ''babies''.

Coatis can be captured in [[cage]] [[trap]]s and [[Animal trainer|trained]] into exotic [[pet]]s. Their small size means they'll give low returns when [[butcher]]ed, making them subpar as livestock. Consider looking for larger, meatier animals to produce food for your dwarves.

Some dwarves [[Preferences|like]] coatis for their ''curiosity''.
