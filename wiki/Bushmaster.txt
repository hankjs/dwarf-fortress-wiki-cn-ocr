'''Bushmasters''' are medium-sized solitary snakes that only appear in [[tropical]] moist [[broadleaf forest]]s. They flee contact, but when threatened their [[syndrome|venomous]] bites provide a more than adequate defense - several nasty and unpleasant health effects, followed shortly by complete paralysis and death by suffocation. Don't approach without a [[crossbow]] unless your dwarves are wearing full military [[armor]], upon pain of a quick death. Like all other species of snake, bushmasters take the whole extent of their lives to reach their maximum size, but because of their bite they're still dangerous as juveniles.

Bushmasters can be captured with [[cage]] [[trap]]s and [[Animal trainer|trained]] into low-value [[pet]]s. They are somewhat prolific [[egg]]-layers, with each clutch ranging between 10 and 20 eggs, which makes them a good target for [[egg production]]. [[Butcher]]ing bushmasters for [[food]] is not too worth it, as they are small and provide few returns, though products made from bushmaster parts are 2 times more [[Item value|valuable]] than products made from common animals.

Some dwarves [[preference|admire]] bushmasters for their ''deadly bite''.

{{D for Dwarf}}
The ruler of all shrubs and vegetation; a truly fearsome foe!  No, really.  This thing causes pain, paralysis, nausea, unconsciousness, dizziness, bleeding, and most likely being eaten by the snake.
