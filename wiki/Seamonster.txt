'''Sea monsters''' are huge, [[Aquatic|sea dwelling]] [[creature]]s found in [[evil]] [[ocean]]s. They can weigh up to 8 tons and come armed with six tentacles, two pincers and powerful jaws. When [[butcher]]ed, they produce enormous amounts of [[food]], enough to feed a fortress for a year or more. Their butchering returns are also worth five times the standard [[Item value|value]]. 

Though tough, sea monsters are immobile on land. A [[drowning chamber|fishing chamber]] can air-drown them, making slaughter and recovery significantly easier. An exception occurs in reanimating biomes, as [[undead]] marine creatures can freely move out of water, and into your fortress. Sea monsters possess a [[pet]] value of 1,000, but lack the necessary tokens to be [[Animal trainer|trainable]].

Some [[dwarves]] [[Preferences|like]] sea monsters for their ''horrifying freakish appearance''.
