'''Alligators''' are intimidating [[Creature|beasts]] found in and around temperate and tropical fresh water [[river]]s and [[lake]]s. They are not tremendously aggressive animals, but will attack [[Dwarf|dwarves]] who [[ambusher|venture foolishly close]]. They appear in clusters of 1-3, and, surprisingly, are not any faster in the water than an average land-based creature that can swim is - say, a dwarf.

With an [[egg]] yield of 10-30 per clutch, a large [[size]] (and thus high [[butcher]]ing returns), a derived [[bone|product]] [[value]] three times that of a much more boring domestic animal, and a high [[pet]] value, alligators are one of the best [[egg production|egg producing]] creatures a fortress could have. As an added bonus, a [[Animal trainer|trained]] group of gators serves as a credible threat to [[invader]]s. As an [[mount|exotic mount]], [[siege]]s may occasionally arrive on the map riding tame alligators, giving their riders a significant combat advantage, as well as the ability to cross or swim through large bodies of water (although this occasionally, and hilariously, has lethal results for their air-breathing riders).

Some dwarves [[Preferences|like]] alligators for their ''strength''.

Rumor has it that the [[humans]] tan alligator [[skin|scales]] into [[leather]], which is then used to make [[armor#Footwear|high boots]]. Their merchants vociferously deny this, claiming that only [[elves]] would try such a thing.
