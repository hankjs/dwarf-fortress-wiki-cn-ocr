'''Cave swallow men''' are humanoid versions of the common [[cave swallow]] and are one of the many [[Creature|races]] of underground tribal [[animal people]] found living in small groups on any [[cavern]] level.

Despite being labelled as hostile in the unit list, cave swallow men initially found in the caverns will ignore your citizens unless provoked. They will usually be observed carrying metal [[spear]]s, [[blowgun]]s and [[shield]]s, ranging from [[copper]] to [[steel]] (which may be a bug). Depending on which other subterranean creatures they have access to, their [[blowdart]]s may be covered in different [[syndrome|poisons]], which can vary from mildly annoying [[cave spider]] venom to highly [[fun|dangerous]] [[giant cave spider]] toxins. You can preemptively check for poisons by selecting a [[blowgunner]], looking in their items tab and viewing their blowdarts. They do not wear [[armor]].

Cave swallow men may launch [[ambush|group attacks]] on your fort. When this happens, all tribesmen on the map will become hostile, even if they were peaceful minutes prior to the invasion. They may arrive with [[pet]]s and [[mount]]s, some of which will be able to fly or easily catch up to your fleeing civilians. These invaders, unlike their above-ground counterparts, will not leave after some time has passed, even if your fort is completely sealed off from the caverns, nor will they prevent migrants, caravans or other invaders from arriving; including more waves of cave swallow men. Because of this, several unchallenged assaults from them can quickly cause your game's FPS to drop to single-digit levels, thus making your fort completely unplayable.

Cave swallow men can fly, meaning that they will be able to fly over your walls or through gaps in your floors and ceilings, so plan your defenses accordingly. It can also make them marginally harder to hit than other creatures their size.


Some dwarves [[Preferences|like]] cave swallow men for their ''coloration''.
