| In this episode, Rainseeker, Capntastic and Toady One talk about the upcoming release, answer questions and carry on. We had difficulty scheduling a time for this recording, so we recorded two segments with Toady and each co-host on different weeks and we didn't attempt to cover a listener suggested topic. Toady also forgot the credits at the end of the second segment, so here they are amplified in the description: Ollieh did the music. mallocks did the transcript.
