'''Giant alligators''' are [[Giant animal|immense counterparts]] of the common [[alligator]] found in many [[savage]] [[river]]s and [[swamp]]s. They are over 8 times bigger than their normal cousins, making them over 54 times more massive than a [[dwarf]]; straying too close to these beasts will lead to your civilians being reduced to mincemeat. If confronted by giant alligators, a competent [[military]] and [[trap]]s are a must. Take caution when fighting them near water, however, as they may cause dwarves to fall into it, where death by drowning is all but inevitable, if the alligator doesn't outright murder them.

While dangerous, giant alligators may be more valuable alive than dead. While their [[pet]] value is actually lower than that of their normal counterparts (500 vs 650), if the player manages to capture and [[Animal trainer|train]] them, giant alligators make some of the best [[egg]]-layers in the whole game; they possess all the good things about normal alligators combined with being ''much'' larger, meaning they give many more returns when [[butcher]]ed. A giant alligator farm will provide a fortress with food, valuable crafting materials and a force of big, mean, water-dwelling defenders.

Some dwarves [[Preferences|like]] giant alligators for their ''strength''.
