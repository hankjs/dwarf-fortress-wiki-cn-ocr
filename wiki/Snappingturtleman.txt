'''Snapping turtle men''' are [[animal people]] variants of the [[common snapping turtle]], who can be found in [[savage]] [[temperate]] [[lake]]s and [[river]]s. They spawn in groups of 1-5 individuals and are possibly aggressive, attacking [[Dwarf|dwarves]] who attempt to provoke them. In terms of size, they are only a little smaller than a dwarf, which makes them potentially dangerous if confronted by unarmed civilians.

Like other savage animal people, snapping turtle men can join [[civilization]]s, become [[historical figure]]s, appear as [[visitor]]s and be playable in [[adventurer mode]].

Some dwarves [[Preferences|like]] snapping turtle men for their ''powerful bites'' and their ''long necks.

They are well known for their skill as [[ambusher]]s. They will often congregate under the leadership of a [[giant rat]] with a stick in the [[cv:sewer|sewers]] of human cities.
