'''Toads''' are a species of [[hateable]] [[amphibious]] [[vermin]] found in any [[pool]], but not during winter. [[Dwarf|Dwarves]] who "absolutely detest toads" will experience an unhappy [[thought]] upon encountering one.

Some dwarves [[Preferences|like]] toads for their ''beauty''.

==Trivia==
*Toads are the very first creature loaded when starting a (non-[[modding|modded]]) game, due to being the first creature defined in the first creature [[raw file]]. Due to this, toads occupy the 0th/first creature index of any loaded game.

[[Main:Toady One|They]] often produce great [[Main:Dwarf Fortress|masterpieces]].
