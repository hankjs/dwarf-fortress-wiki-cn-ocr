'''Cobaltite''' is a black stone in Premium mode, or a brilliant blue stone in ASCII mode. Its particularly high [[density]] makes it useful for [[trap#Stone-fall_Trap|stone-fall traps]] and as [[catapult]] ammunition, and its color makes it well-suited for various aesthetic (''that is, mostly non-item decoration'') purposes. 

Despite its appearance in ASCII mode (showing up as {{Raw Tile|£|1:7:1}} unmined and {{Raw Tile|*|1:1}} mined), it is '''not''' a usable [[ore]].

== In Real Life ==
Cobaltite is an ore of cobalt, a [[metal]] not modeled in ''Dwarf Fortress''. Interestingly, the name derives from the word [[kobold]].

<!-- Reference: Cobalt's inability to be smelted via "normal" means (instead yielding a powder and poisonous fumes), and the origin of the metal's name -->
[[Human]]s are known to mistake cobaltite for more valuable ores, suffering from severe bouts of [[Syndrome|fun]] from attempting to smelt it. Dwarves of course find this endlessly amusing, especially when the humans inevitably claim that [[kobold]]s tampered with the ore.
