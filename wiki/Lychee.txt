'''Lychee''' is one of the many genera of [[tree]]s found above ground. Like the vast majority of above ground trees, lychee [[wood]] is brown and produces brown products. Lychee wood is the fourth densest wood, beaten by [[olive]]s, [[glumprong]]s, and [[blood thorn]]s.

Lychee trees bear fruit that can be harvested by setting up a gathering [[zone]]. They can be eaten raw, cooked, or brewed into [[alcohol|lychee wine]].

Some [[Dwarf|dwarves]] [[Preferences|like]] lychee trees for their ''fruit''.
