'''Grey parrots''' are [[Creature|birds]] who may be found exclusively in [[tropical]] most broadleaf [[forest]]s, where they appear in groups of 3-5 individuals. They do little but fly about aimlessly and are among the smallest creatures in the game who aren't [[vermin]], making them entirely harmless to [[dwarves]]. Due to their tiny size, a [[Hunter|hunted]] grey parrot won't be [[butcher]]able. All grey parrots are born with Legendary [[skill]] in [[Climber|climbing]].

Grey parrots may be captured in [[cage]] [[trap]]s and [[Animal trainer|trained]] into cheap exotic [[pet]]s. Trying to butcher a trained parrot will only yield a [[skull]] in return, making them useless for a [[meat industry]], and they lay considerably less [[egg]]s than the average domestic bird. However, they are among the longest living animals found in the wild, meaning if your dwarves adopt them, they're going to last for several decades.

Some dwarves [[Preferences|like]] grey parrots for their ''intelligence'' and their ''social nature''.

{{D for Dwarf}}
[[rock|Dwarven scholars]] debate over the true color of Grey Parrots. Traditionalists insist that grey parrots are grey, although some [[Sleep|debate]] exists over whether they are gray instead. Another common argument (usually made in an attempt to [[insanity|annoy]] a [[diplomat]] by occupying the [[mayor]] for [[calendar#Ages|a few extra months]]) is that, according to [[color scheme|the humans]], grey parrots should be called lgray parrots instead. Even more radical dwarves insist on calling them 7:0:0 parrots, but this is too easily confused with the pet value of [[giant cave swallow]]s to be widely accepted.
Parrots are often found in a non-living state, often when sold, and this may cause a tantrum, with the offended dwarf exclaiming "This is an ex-parrot!"
