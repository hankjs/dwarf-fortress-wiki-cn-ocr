'''Giant buzzards''' are [[giant animal]] cousins of the normal [[buzzard]] who can be found in many [[temperate]] and [[desert]] [[savage]] [[biome]]s. While their smaller cousins do little more than spam cancelled jobs, giant buzzards prove to be a genuine threat to a budding [[fortress]] - weighting 149 times more than a normal buzzard, these monsters possess all the annoyance of their normal counterparts and are equally prone to [[Steals food|stealing your food]] if they can reach it, and unlike their regular counterparts, they are not beyond confronting your [[dwarves]] should they get in the way. Nonetheless, as the fortress grows, a squad of [[Crossbowman|marksdwarves]] can make quick work of the creatures, provided they can hit them ([[Fun|and they probably can't, cue job cancel spam]]). They are considered exotic [[mount]]s, so you may see [[Elf|elves]] riding them into battle in the event of a [[siege]].

Like their equally-ugly smaller versions, giant buzzards can be captured with [[cage]] [[trap]]s and tamed into [[pet]]s, either for a [[zoo]] or for [[egg production]]. However, as they only lay 2-3 eggs at a time, their laying performance is lacking. Giant buzzards do provide a respectable amount of meat and bones when butchered, thanks to their great size, should the player choose to farm them for food in revenge for the prior thievery.

Some dwarves like giant buzzards for their ''striking red face''.
