'''Limonite''' is an [[ore]] of [[iron]], a mid-value metal useful for [[weapon]]s and [[armor]]. It can be smelted at a [[smelter]] by a dwarf with the [[furnace operating]] [[labor]] activated to produce four [[iron]] [[bar]]s.

It is, for all [[metalsmithing]] purposes, identical to [[magnetite]] and [[hematite]]. It has a noticeably lower solid [[density]] (read "weighs less") than the other iron ores and can thus be hauled to its destination more quickly than the other two ores.
