A '''counting house''' is a structure built by a merchant [[company]] at a [[site]]. A single company might build multiple counting houses, some of which might be in the same site.

A counting house consists of several floors, with bins filled with goods on one, and a room with chairs and tables on another. Sometimes, [[artifact]]s might be hidden at counting houses.

== Merchant companies ==
A merchant company is a group of [[merchant]]s. In world generation, members of a merchant company will trade items between sites, as an expression of the underlying economy simulation. Currently, the primary purpose of merchant companies is to facilitate interconnections between sites of different civilizations, and to ensure there are plenty of rich [[historical figure]]s that might buy properties in sites, build [[Tower_(structure)|fancy towers]], and fund all sorts of [[intrigue|schemes]]. In short, it is mostly invisible.

Merchant companies will have a leader position (named master or head), and may have an administrator (also named governor or factor) position with trade and record keeping responsibilities.
