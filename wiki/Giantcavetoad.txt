{{creaturedesc}}
'''Giant cave toads''' are large [[creatures]] found in [[caverns]], inhabiting the first and second layers. They spawn one at a time, wandering the underground all while terrorizing [[crundle]]s and harassing [[dwarves]] who they encounter in their path, sometimes causing heavy damage in the process - giant cave toads are over three times larger than the average dwarf and are very aggressive, though they generally do not fare well when facing a squad of equipped [[military]] dwarves.

Giant cave toads are [[building destroyer]]s and will attempt to topple [[furniture]] they come across, which can be exploited to easily lure them into [[trap]]s. They may also be seen being [[Mount|ridden]] by [[goblin]]s during [[siege]]s, where they will gleefully swim over any moat you are using as a defense - whether their riders survive the trek is another story.

Giant cave toads can be captured with [[cage]] traps and [[Animal trainer|trained]] into valuable pets. If a breeding pair is obtained, they can be used for a fortress' [[meat industry]] as they produce a steady supply of [[meat]], [[bone]]s, [[fat]] and [[prepared organs]], with their products being worth 4 times more than those of standard animals. Unlike toads in real life, giant cave toads do not lay eggs. Giant cave toads reach their full size in 2 years, and should preferably be [[butcher]]ed at that age for optimal product returns.

Some dwarves [[Preferences|like]] giant cave toads for their ''strength''.
