[[File:noise_preview.png|right]]Certain jobs generate '''noise''' which may disturb [[dwarves]] sleeping nearby.  Depending on a job's noise level and proximity, your dwarves could sleep "uneasily due to noise", "very uneasily due to noise", or be woken up by noise. These events will produce unhappy [[thought]]s in varying degrees.

Noise in [[cavern]] layers will also agitate [[Forgotten beast|forgotten beasts]], which may cause them to attack sooner. Don't worry about this too much, because your fortress' [[wealth]] has a much greater impact on how soon they attack.

Neither [[wall]]s nor [[door]]s will insulate dwarves from noise - distance and how loud a job is are the only factors determining whether a dwarf's sleep will be disturbed. Noise is produced when a noisy job is completed, but thoughts about noise do not appear until the sleeping dwarf has woken up. 

Also, dwarves walking through a sleeping dwarf's room (even over their heads) will not cause noise, which is important for [[bedroom design]].

'''Note''': Contrary to common belief based on [[23a:Noise|earlier versions]], [[workshop]]s do ''not'' currently produce any noise.

==Noisiness of various jobs==
Only 5 jobs are known to cause noise. These include the following:

* [[Digging]] - 8 tiles
* [[Wood cutting]] - 8 tiles
* [[Engraving]] - 4 tiles
* [[Fortification]] carving - 4 tiles
* Removing [[construction]]s - 8 tiles

====Visualization====

Noise radiates across [[z-level]]s in the shape of a cube, in all 6 directions (north/south, east/west, ''and'' up/down), so noise that travels 4 tiles will generate noise in a 9x9 pattern on 9 successive floors.  The noise radiates from the center of the noise-producing things.

== Avoiding unhappy thoughts caused by noise ==
* Don't dig near bedrooms when there are dwarves sleeping in them.
* Smooth your bedrooms before placing the actual furniture.

== Designing in anticipation of noise ==
* Putting all your bedrooms 8 levels or lower below ground eliminates noise from wood cutting (''and all other relevant noise-related concerns, that being beside the point'').
* Remember that [[jail]]s, [[hospital]]s, and sleeping [[barracks]] should also ideally be kept away from noise, in addition to standard and noble bedrooms.

Facilities that ''can'' be safely built around or above/below bedrooms and other sleeping facilities, to separate the area set aside for the "quiet zone", include anything that does ''not'' make noise.

== In adventurer mode ==
In [[adventurer mode]], various noises that can be heard in unseen areas will be represented by a respective icon, otherwise the sounds will be shown with exclamation marks of different colors in older versions, or if ASCII mode is turned on in the premium version. Double exclamation marks denote louder noises.

Most wildlife will not make any noise in adventurer mode, with a few exceptions, such as [[capybara]]s and [[kakapo]]s.
