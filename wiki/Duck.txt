'''Ducks''' are small [[domestic animal|domestic birds]] which can be encountered in the wild, living in [[lake]]s and [[wetland]]s. Females of the species are called ''ducks'', while males are referred to as ''drakes'' (''not to be confused with [[dragon]]s!'') and hatchlings are called ''ducklings''.

Ducks are the [[Domestic animal#Comparison of domestic poultry|smallest of the common domestic poultry]], so small that they only produce a [[skull]] when [[butcher]]ed. They take two years to grow to full size, and have a relatively short lifespan. These qualities make raising ducks useless for a [[meat industry]]. However, on average, ducks lay the second-most [[egg]]s of any domestic bird (8-13, exceeded only by [[turkey]]s' 10-14) making them a decent choice for [[egg production]].

Some dwarves [[Preferences|like]] ducks for their ''quacks''.

{{D for Dwarf}}
Many a new player has first seen the drake in their unit list and become excited, imagining it to be some sort of lesser [[dragon]], until they found out it's just a duck. Such scenarios have typically ended with a new duck totem being added to the finished goods stockpile.
