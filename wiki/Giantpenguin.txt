'''Giant penguins''' are enlarged [[Creature|counterparts]] of the common [[penguin]], found in [[savage]] arctic [[ocean]]s. They waddle through the landscape in groups of 5 to 10 individuals, each standing nearly four times the size of a [[dwarf]], though despite their size, they are as benign as their smaller cousins, fleeing from dwarves unless cornered. [[Hunter]]s and a half-competent [[military]] squad should be able to take on these creatures without much difficulty.

Giant penguins can be captured in [[cage]] [[trap]]s and, unlike every other kind of penguin in the game, they can be [[Animal trainer|trained]] into [[pet]]s, possessing the standard high value of a giant creature. Because they provide a respectable amount of [[food]] and [[bone]]s when [[butcher]]ed, the idea of breeding them for a [[meat industry]] is an attractive one, but they are very poor [[egg]]-layers - only laying 2 eggs at a time - and take two years to reach their adult size, meaning the player will require patience to get a functional giant penguin farm running smoothly. Granted, crazier things have been done before.

Some dwarves [[Preferences|like]] giant penguins for their ''enormous size'', their ''coloration'', their ''waddling gait'' and their ''way of flying through the water''.

==Trivia==

*In real life, a genus of extinct penguin named ''[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palaeeudyptinae Palaeeudyptinae]'' is sometimes known as the giant penguin. However, as the game's giant penguins are enlarged versions of [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magellanic_penguin Magellanic penguins], this is most likely a coincidence.
