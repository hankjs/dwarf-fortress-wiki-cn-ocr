The '''mayor''' is a [[noble]] whose job it is to speak with unhappy citizens, and (until a [[baron]] is appointed) entertain foreign [[diplomat]]s. They are automatically elected from the most social [[dwarf]], most likely the [[expedition leader]], once the population reaches 50. A new mayor may be elected from time to time as your dwarves' social skills change.

== Mayoral nobility ==
[[File:Goblin_slaying_Mayor.png‎|thumb|left|A dwarven mayor conducting a "meeting" with some goblin "liaisons".]]A mayor or expedition leader is required to appoint other nobles. Should your leader suffer an [[unfortunate accident]], you will have to wait for a new leader to be elected before appointing nobles.

Mayors are classy individuals, who require certain living standards in their rooms and furniture. They may [[demand]] certain types of furniture in their rooms and will get unhappy if you don't comply. They can [[mandate]] the production of certain goods, and receive a happy thought if you comply. If the mandated items are not produced in time, the mayor will receive an unhappy thought and will order the [[Justice|punishment]] of whoever they consider responsible. Likewise, they can prohibit the export of certain goods instead of mandating their construction, resulting in dwarves being punished for trade violations.

Mayors are not replaced by [[baron]]s, [[duke]]s, [[count]]s or [[monarch]]s; if one of these nobles arrives, or if a citizen of your fortress is promoted to one of these positions, the mayor will still issue mandates and require quarters.

== Mayoral elections ==

Mayors are elected for one year. [[Elections]] take place at exactly 4:00 PM on the 17th day of summer (specifically, 2000 season-ticks after the beginning of the season). If you don't have a mayor, then the election will happen at the beginning of ''every season'', rather than just summer. If an election doesn't trigger after gaining 50 dwarves for whatever reason, any change in the nobles' screen, such as assigning the expedition leader's position as "leave vacant" will force an election.

When an election happens, it's usually the dwarf with the highest social skills who gets elected. In previous versions [[children]] had nothing to do but socialize, and did, therefore, gain lots of social skill, which carries over when a child becomes an adult at age 18 and therefore an 18-year-old mayor was not a rare sight. But in the current version, children prefer playing over socializing, and thus will only rarely become a mayor (with the possible exception of migrant children, who already had high social skill on arrival, and unhappy children constantly complaining). Prime candidates for mayor are [[vampire]]s (who tend to have high social skills, if they have been around for a long time), tamed [[gremlin]]s, and other non-working citizens of your fortress, since they cannot be put to work either. The mayor doesn't actually need to be a dwarf, any [[Citizenship|citizen]] can be elected - however, dwarves currently on a [[mission]], or otherwise absent from the fortress, cannot.

If the player decides to do mass-trading with the broker (with as many trade transactions as possible), the main candidate for the mayor would be the broker (due to the high skill gain per trade transaction in comparison to normal socializing interactions), regardless of any competition, which is the only reliable way to make sure that a certain dwarf will (eventually) become (and stay) mayor.

== Miscellaneous ==

Curiously, a mayor is able to appoint replacements for elected positions, including their own.{{bug|2512}} If your mayor likes something unpleasant like [[Finished goods|puzzleboxes]], you can simply have them appoint their own replacement. This also creates a historical event, which makes for good [[statue]]s of dwarves rejecting the old mayor with which to brighten up the new mayor's office. Note that the ex-mayor may periodically win election back into the mayorship.

<!-- Doesn't work; see bug 3047:  http://www.bay12games.com/dwarves/mantisbt/view.php?id=3047
If you manually select a higher-office noble like the monarch or duke to be your mayor, their mandates will all end when a new mayor is elected. Setting the game to pause and pop-up in announcements will help keep track of this whenever a new mayor is elected. This can provide a helpful relief from mandates on occasion.
