'''Horseshoe crab men''' are [[animal people]] variants of the common [[horseshoe crab]], who can be found in [[savage]] [[ocean]]s. They spawn in groups of 1-3 individuals and are generally content to keep to themselves. In terms of size, they are a little over half the weight of the average [[dwarf]].

Like other savage animal people, they can join [[civilization]]s, become [[historical figure]]s, appear as [[visitor]]s and be playable in [[adventurer mode]].

Some dwarves [[Preferences|like]] horseshoe crab men for their ''ability to hide in sand''.

Horseshoe crab men are known to be great [[weaponsmith]]s, supplying the [[Squid_man|squid men]] with armaments for their war against the [[Octopus_man|octopus men]].
