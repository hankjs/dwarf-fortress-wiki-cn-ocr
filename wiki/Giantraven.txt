The '''giant raven''' is the giant variety of the [[raven]]. It is much bigger than a regular raven, nearly 174&times; as big, in fact.

It may be a good idea to capture one of these creatures, as they can be butchered, or kept alive for [[egg production]].

Some dwarves [[Preferences|like]] giant ravens for their ''intelligence''.
