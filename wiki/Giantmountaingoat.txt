'''Giant mountain goats''' are much larger counterparts of the [[mountain goat]] who can be found inhabiting [[savage]] [[mountain]]s. They behave much like their normal cousins, appearing in groups of 1 to 4 individuals who meander aimlessly around the landscape, with the difference being that they rival the weight of an adult [[moose]]. Despite the size, however, they are benign and will normally flee from danger. A baby giant mountain goat is called a ''giant mountain goat kid''.

Giant mountain goats may be captured in [[cage trap]]s and [[Animal trainer|trained]] into [[pet]]s. Due to the larger size, they produce more food when [[butcher]]ed than a normal goat, though they are among the smaller (and less productive) giant creatures. Like a common goat, a trained giant mountain goat will require a [[pasture]] to survive. They are considered exotic [[mount]]s and may be witnessed being ridden by [[Elf|elves]] during [[siege]]s.

Some dwarves [[Preferences|like]] giant mountain goats for their ''beards'', their ''long horns'' and their ''surefootedness''.
