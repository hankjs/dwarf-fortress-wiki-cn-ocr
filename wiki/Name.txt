'''Names''' are what individual [[creature]]s are known by. Creatures in [[civilization]]s that can speak are given names upon birth; most other creatures must be named by such a civilization. Any creature that receives a name becomes a [[historical figure]], which means the game will keep track of it as it loads (and offloads) the world.

== Name basics ==

Every member of a civilization has at least two names: a first name and a last name, which are given at birth, and are quite random. Unlike most real names, neither name is inherited from the parents.

* The ''first name'' typically is a single word of the civilization's [[language]]. (A creature's first name is never translated in-game, unlike all other names.)  It appears that first names are limited solely to nouns. 
* The ''last name'' is a compound of two words in the creature's language. It appears that the words can be any two, though Noun-Noun, Adjective-Noun, and Verb-Noun appear to be the most common pairings. The last name is translated to English in several places, such as looking at the creature's profile screen. Words relating to the creature's civilization's selected symbols are more likely to appear in the creature's last name.

Pets and working animals are given names when they are adopted. These names are identical to the standard names of the civilization their owner belongs to. Unlike real life, pets are never renamed if they become the property of someone else. Only pets belonging to the player's fortress are named, not the working animals of traders.  

Creatures from civilizations who cannot speak will not have names at all, unless they have been given one by other civilizations, and those who can only speak in [[Creature_token#UTTERANCES|utterances]] will, likewise, have untranslatable names that appear to be gibberish.

== Dwarven first names ==

Dwarven first names come from a combination of symbol sets, as defined in the [[raw file]]s; entity_default.txt and [[Language#language_SYM.txt|language_SYM.txt]].
:175 Dwarf names = (ARTIFICE ∪ [[Language SYM.txt/Earth|EARTH]]) \ (DOMESTIC ∪ SUBORDINATE ∪ FLOWERY ∪ NEGATOR ∪ NEGATIVE ∪ UGLY ∪ EVIL)

:Or, in other words, all words in the Artifice and Earth symbol groups are available for use in Dwarven names unless they are also in one of these symbol groups: Domestic, Subordinate, Evil, Flowery, Negative, Ugly, Negator.

First names also need to have [THE_NOUN_SING] in their language_words.txt entry. This filters out an additional 10, leaving a total of 165 valid names.{{cite forum|172960.0}}{{verify}}

== Epithets ==

When a creature scores five notable kills (typically creatures belonging to a civilization, but also any creature that has scored a notable kill itself), it is given an epithet by its civilization. The epithet is most often two names, but can also occasionally be one, though each of these names can be a compound word. The words appear to be selected somewhat randomly, leading to epithets that translate as gibberish, such as "the Hardy Ring-Cobra of Dashing". On occasion, the epithet can be [[Main:Cacame Awemedinade|surprisingly apt]]. The epithet is translated in the same places that the creature's second name is translated.

== Animal and megabeast names ==

Animals who are not pets can gain a name by acquiring notable kills or becoming an enemy of a civilization. The language of the animal's name is determined by the civilization that named it, though the relationship is not always straightforward--a wild [[crundle]] that kills an elven-named forgotten beast at a dwarven site may receive an elven name, for instance. Most animals who acquire a name in [[world generation]] do not ever acquire additional ones, though it is possible. Animals can acquire multiple names more frequently either in [[fortress mode]] by killing your dwarves, invaders, or uninvited guests, or in [[adventurer mode]] by killing your adventurers or members of their parties.

[[Megabeast]]s acquire names in an unusual fashion - all megabeasts have at least one to four names. Unlike other creatures, megabeasts (obviously) do not have a parent civilization, and instead appear to gain their original names from the first civilization they have contact with. In most cases, they gain epithets from conflict with others  - ergo, megabeasts with only one or two names have likely led uneventful lives.

== Other names/false identities ==
On occasion, your dwarves will decide to give names to the creatures inhabiting the area around a fortress. It appears that only creatures who can talk will get names; additionally, the creature must remain on the map for an extended period of time - any creature that can speak, such as a [[snailman]] who has become stuck in a ditch, can be given a name. Other than that, the impetus for naming creatures is murky - some creatures are named after only a few seasons, while others may go unnamed for decades. It may be that a creature ''(elf or human, etc.)'' must be in the preferences of a dwarf to receive a name, or the naming may occur randomly.

[[Tree]]s near [[elf|elven]] settlements may also be named, though this currently has no known effect.

Some creatures assume false identities, usually for nefarious purposes - currently, those are [[agent]]s and [[vampire]]s. They usually can't be confronted in fortress mode, but when they die, their actual name will be displayed in the unit list. In adventure mode, if you correctly call out a vampire, they will reveal their identity. You may also assume multiple false identities yourself, if you wish to game the [[rumor]] system. In legends mode, all [[historical figure]]s are displayed under their real names.
Interrogation can also reveal any false names the target knows, either their own or those of other members of organisations they're a part of.
