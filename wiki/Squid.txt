'''Squids''' are a type of aquatic [[vermin]] found in any [[ocean]] year-round, and are a ready source of [[food]] when [[fish cleaning|cleaned]] at a [[fishery]]. Their [[blood]] is blue and they possess the ability to squirt ink, though this can't be seen, due to them being vermin. All squids possess Legendary [[skill]] in [[Climber|climbing]].

Some [[dwarves]] [[Preferences|like]] squids for their ''ability to spray ink''.
