==Uses==
Milk of lime's sole use is in the production of parchment. A dwarf with the [[tanner]] labor enabled can bring a [[skin]] and a bucket of milk of lime to a [[tanner's shop]] to produce a sheet of parchment.

==Real world==
Milk of lime (or ''limewater'') is a milky solution of calcium hydroxide in water. It has had a wide variety of uses since ancient times, including fresco painting, food preparation, and personal hygiene.
