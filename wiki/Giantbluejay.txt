'''Giant bluejays''' are the [[giant animal]] version of [[blue jay]]s, who appear in savage temperate biomes. While each giant bluejay is bigger than a [[grizzly bear]], and they appear in flocks of 5-10 individuals, they pose little threat to your fortress, mostly flying idly over it in the skies. (They are not harmless, however, and can be agitated, with entire flocks of enraged azure birds attacking relentlessly and posing dangers to newly established dwarven colonies.)

If you get your [[marksdwarf|marksdwarves]] to shoot them down or manage to catch one, they give a decent amount of meat, bone, fat, and edible organs, though nothing spectacular. A female giant bluejay lays clusters of 2-7 eggs, which makes them a worse alternative for [[egg production]] than all the common [[domestic animal|domestic poultry]], but a better choice for the [[meat industry]] as they grow even quicker than both [[chicken]]s and [[turkey]]s, and reach a much bigger size.

Giant bluejays can be tamed and sold by [[elf|elves]], and [[mount]]ed by them in [[siege]]s.

Some dwarves [[Preferences|like]] giant blue jays for their ''coloration''.
