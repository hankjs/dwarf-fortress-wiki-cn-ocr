'''Prophet''' is a profession for some inhabitants of generated [[site]]s, like [[town]]s. Some prophets show up as [[visitor]]s in fortress mode, and [[agent]]s sometimes try to pose as prophets. In world generation, prophets will attempt to establish and expand [[religion]]s. Prophets are [[Unit_type_token#PROPHET|shown in white]].

==Fortress mode==

Prophets will not [[immigration|migrate]] to your fortress in this version. 
==Adventure mode==
In adventure mode, the player can create a false identity for themselves as a prophet. This allows them a special dialogue option called "Prophesize" which can be quite entertaining.  Examples:
