[[File:AlluvialPlain.JPG|thumb|250px|right|An alluvial layer of land in [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red_Rock_Canyon_State_Park_(California) Canyon State Park].]]Several minerals, ores, and gems are specified to occur at least in part within '''alluvial layers'''. Alluvial stone is loose and unconsolidated stone that has been eroded away, smoothed down by water flow, and then redeposited in a non-marine setting. In Dwarf Fortress, all [[sedimentary]] layers are capable of containing alluvial deposits.

Whether or not a particular [[stone]], [[gem]], or [[ore]] appears in the alluvial layer is controlled by the <tt>[ENVIRONMENT:ALLUVIAL:...]</tt> tag in its [[raw file]]s. Alluvial environments can contain [[cluster]]s of:
:*[[native gold]]
:*[[native platinum]]
:*[[cassiterite]]
:*jade [[gem]]s ([[blue jade|blue]], [[lavender jade|lavender]], [[pink jade|pink]], [[white jade|white]], and [[green jade|green]])
