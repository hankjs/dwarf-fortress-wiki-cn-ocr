'''Fox squirrels''' are a species of [[above ground]] [[vermin]] found in [[savage]] [[temperate]] [[forest]]s. They are both one of the largest vermin (tied with the [[fluffy wambler]]) and one of the most valuable (tied with the [[knuckle worm]]). They can be captured by [[trapper]]s and turned into [[pet]]s. All fox squirrels possess Legendary [[skill]] in [[Climber|climbing]].

Some dwarves [[Preferences|like]] fox squirrels for their ''tenacity''.
