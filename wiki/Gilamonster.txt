'''Gila monsters''' are small [[Creature|reptiles]] found in all [[desert]] [[biome]]s. They are solitary creatures who only spawn one at a time. While carnivorous, they are less than half the size of a [[cat]] and therefore should not pose a threat to an adult [[dwarf]]. They do, however, possess a [[Syndrome|venomous]] bite which is ''relatively'' mild (as far as venoms go), but still causes pain and swelling on the victim; and with a [[Attribute#Toughness|flimsy]] dwarf, pain can lead to unconsciousness, which is never a good look in combat. 

Gila monsters are natural swimmers and are able to path through [[water]] and breathe in it, should your desert map possess any.

Gila monsters are fairly standard as far as [[pet]]s go, should the player choose to [[Animal trainer|train]] them. They produce similar products to cats when butchered, and so can be used if the player wants some extra [[meat]]. They fare relatively well when used for [[egg production]], as they are one of the better egg-layers among desert creatures, laying between 2-12 [[egg]]s at a time. However, they are ultimately less productive than [[ostrich]]es and several domesticated poultry.

Some dwarves [[Preferences|like]] gila monsters for their ''venomous bite'' and their ''colouration''.
