== General updates ==
* Fixed hang on Linux when updating an installed mod the first time.
* Removed the temporary geology variables placement layer/freq/parent from lua to prevent crashes.
* Fixed crash when opening the mod menu after deleting the %appdata% folder.
* Fixed a logic issue where any duplicated raws detected will cause further types of duplicated raws to no longer print.
* Init files are loaded from the game folder first so that updates always apply properly.
* The game now checks for prefs/[[arena.txt]] and prefs/[[colors.txt]].
* Added more cases of auto-toggling portable mode if something fails to save.
