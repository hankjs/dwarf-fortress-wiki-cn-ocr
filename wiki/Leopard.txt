'''Leopards''' are very rare [[Creature|animals]] found in [[tropical]] and [[desert]] [[biome]]s, where they spawn one at a time. Weighting a little less than a [[dwarf]], these predators can kill an unarmed civilian if provoked, but shouldn't pose a threat to a [[military]] protection by [[metal]] [[armor]]. On top of low frequency rate, no more than 3 leopards will exist in a single surrounding before they're considered locally [[extinct]]. A newborn leopard is called a ''cub''.

Leopards can be captured in [[cage]] [[trap]]s and [[Animal trainer|trained]] into exotic [[pet]]s, and they're also sometimes brought along with [[Elf|elven]] [[caravan]]s. They can receive additional war or hunting training as well, further increasing their potential, though their {{token|MEANDERER}} tag will cause them to move around very slowly, making them unreliable{{Bug|9588}}. Products made from leopard parts, should you choose to [[butcher]] them, are [[item value|worth]] thrice more than those made from parts of common animals. Leopards take 3 years to reach adulthood, though they're fully grown by the age of 2.

Leopards have a 10/1001 chance of having black hair, and a 1/1001 of having white hair, otherwise being spotted. Note that [[genetics]] apply to ones born in your fort, so a breeding program with a limited set of parents might not be able to give a non-spotted leopard, no matter the number of cubs. On the other hand, two non-spotted leopards will always give non-spotted offspring.

Some dwarves [[Preferences|like]] leopards for their ''spotted coats''.
