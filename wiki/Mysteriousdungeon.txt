:''"This place is dangerous.  Steel yourself against [[Dungeon guardian|ancient enemies]].  Try not to let yourself be surrounded, and remain standing.  Enter and vanquish!  Or slip in [[Ambusher|unseen]].  Securing the [[Primordial remnant|treasure]] is all that matters."''
:— A [[deity]]'s proclamation to their [[chosen]].

'''Mysterious lairs''', '''dungeons''' and '''palaces''' ([[File:Site mythical 1.png]][[File:Site mythical 2.png]][[File:Site mythical 3.png]] / {{Raw Tile|■|0:0:1}}) are '''mythical [[site]]s'''{{version|51.01-beta26}} that can be explored in [[adventurer mode]]. They are created in a time before time, with no known founder.

==Structure==
All mythic sites have an aboveground room and an underground section. There are a number of common features, such as vertical [[bars]] activated by [[lever]]s, [[Trap#Weapon trap|trapped]] [[chest]]s, and treasure on a [[Ramp|raised]] floor.

The smallest of the mythic site types, lairs are square buildings with two floors and several floor plans. Dungeons are larger and deeper, often with multiple levers protecting the treasure room.

Palaces are even more elaborate, featuring several floors both above and below ground. The building is circular, like a [[dark fortress]]. Many of the inhabitants have a special [[dungeon guardian]] [[syndrome]], and the strongest of them can wield a [[magic]] weapon: a [[Artifact|legendary]], [[Item quality|masterwork]] item made from a [[primordial remnant]]. The rewards are greater, as [[Large pot|pots]] and [[jug]]s filled with [[Mythical substance|healing substances]] are scattered throughout.

[[File:Adv weather light inside eerie.png]] When inside a mythic site, the [[Weather|atmosphere]] is described as ''"The area gives off a sickly light."''

==Inhabitants==
Each site is lead by a [[dungeon guardian]], an [[Immortality|immortal]] [[historical figure]] with a unique title (such as "ancient of the trees" or "bark worshipper"). Currently, this guardian has no interactions throughout history, beyond being a member of a "mythic entity". They are equipped with [[Quality|high-quality]] [[weapon]]s and [[armor]], and good [[combat skill]]s to wield them. They also have a [[Flask|waterskin]] filled with a [[mythical substance]] they can drink to heal.

Their [[Syndrome|title]] grants them [[immortality]], immunity to blindness, fevers, exertion, and fear; removes their need to eat, sleep, and drink; and prevents their physical attributes from raising or rusting. They are sterile, and their personality is maximally loveless, hateful, violent, cruel, and non-altruistic. Visually, their skin is drawn with the same purple tone as a [[necromancer]], or represented as a {{Raw Tile|ÿ|5:1}} glyph. 

A small squad of [[goblin]] soldiers (as [[Surroundings#Evil|evil]] creatures that don't need to eat or drink) also guard these sites. They are worse-equipped and less skilled than the aforementioned guardian.

Mythical sites also have [[Creature|animal]] populations, with access to "ancient" variants of predators. These creatures can potentially be drawn from the [[cavern]]s. Mythical animals gain a special prefix inspired by their [[sphere]], with the same effects as the [[dungeon guardian]] syndrome. They are tamed and loyal to the site's defenders.

All inhabitants speak the [[divine language]].

==Treasure==
Offering service to a [[religion]] will start a quest to collect a [[primordial remnant]] from a dungeon. The same [[sphere]] influences the name of both this object and the creature guarding it.

All types of [[armor]] and [[weapon]] can be found in chests. It will usually be of good quality, though any armor defaults to being sized for [[human]]s. Though the guardian's [[entity token]]s suggest that they should be able to make use of [[divine metal]]s and [[Divine fabric|fabric]], they do not have access to those materials.

Mysterious sites are the only known source of [[mythical substance]]s and [[magic]] items made from [[primordial remnant]]s.
