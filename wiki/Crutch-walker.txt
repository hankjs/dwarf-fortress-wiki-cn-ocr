'''Crutch-walker''' is the [[skill]] used when using [[crutch]]es by those who have [[wound|lost]] the ability to walk normally, reducing the movement penalty while moving around the map.

The crutch-walker [[skill|skill level]] is related to the penalty received to [[gait|movement]]. As the skill develops, the character moves at [[gait|speeds]] closer to their ambulatory movement rate up to Legendary+5 rank, at which movement rate is no longer impaired while a crutch is held. The quality or type of crutch is not related to outcome. It is possible to gain [[experience]] in this skill in [[adventure mode]] by holding a crutch in either hand. 

Crutch-walkers are the natural byproducts of a fortress' [[health care|health care industry]].
