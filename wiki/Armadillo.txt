'''Armadillos''' are small, solitary [[Creature|animals]] who inhabit most [[tropical]] [[biome]]s. A bit larger than your average [[cat]], they're benign meanderers who do little but wander around aimlessly. When threatened, an armadillo can and will curl up into a ball; in this state, they will neither move nor attack, making them similar to a [[giant tortoise]] that has retracted into its [[shell]]. Male armadillos are called ''boars'', while females are ''sows'' and infants are ''pups''.

Armadillos can be captured in [[cage]] [[trap]]s and [[Animal trainer|trained]] into low-value exotic [[pet]]s. They don't provide much [[food]] or [[bone]]s when [[butcher]]ed due to their fairly small size, but do provide you with a shell that can be used by your [[bone carver]]s.

Some dwarves [[Preferences|like]] armadillos for their ''thick, bony armor plates''.
