'''Glumprongs''' are a type of [[above ground]] [[tree]] found only in dry, [[Surroundings#Evil|evil]] regions. Glumprong trees are notable for their unique purple color, their odd structure, and for having the heaviest [[wood]] from an [[Tree#Aboveground trees|aboveground tree]]. Glumprong trees are only trunk and roots, with no branches, [[leaf|leaves]], [[seed]]s, or [[fruit]]. However, the wood from these trees is very [[Density|dense]], twice that of most typical wood. This heavyweight wood is suboptimal for [[hauling]], but can be useful for some niche weight-based applications.

If you embark in an [[Surroundings#Evil|evil-aligned]] area, glumprong trees may be an enticing source of wood, since they lack useful [[seed]]s and [[fruit]]. Unfortunately, glumprong wood is the second-heaviest wood in the game, behind only [[blood thorn]], a tree-like fungus found only in the deepest [[cavern]]s. The relatively high weight of glumprong [[log]]s may leave your haulers a bit more vulnerable to [[evil weather]] or [[undead|hostile local creatures]]. Once you have the logs inside, you'll find glumprong wood's higher weight makes it somewhat less useful than other types of wood for wooden containers and other tools meant for hauling, like [[barrel]]s, [[bin]]s, and [[wheelbarrow]]s. Wheelbarrows, ideally ones made of lighter wood, can be helpful for hauling glumprong logs.

This doesn't make glumprong wood useless, though. If you'd like purple wooden [[furniture]], [[workshop]]s, or [[construction]]s, glumprong's weight scarcely matters. Glumprong logs burn into [[charcoal]] or [[ash]] just as well as any wood. There are even a few cases where the greater weight of glumprong wood is somewhat useful, like [[ballista]] bolts, [[crossbow]]s, [[trap component]]s (especially blunt ones like the [[spiked ball]]), and [[Minecart#Capacity and weights|empty minecart sorting]].

Glumprong wood is only notably [[density|dense]] in comparison to other types of wood. It's still lighter than any [[Divine metal|non]]-[[Adamantine|spoiler]] [[metal]], [[stone]], [[ceramic]], or [[glass]]. Even relatively light metals like [[aluminum]] weigh more than twice as much. If glumprong wood is the only type of wood available to you, it is still superior to using some other [[material]] for [[barrel]]s, [[bin]]s, [[bucket]]s, [[cage]]s, [[large pot]]s, and [[wheelbarrow]]s.

When it comes to making weapons, glumprong's weight makes it generally superior to [[bone]] or other kinds of wood, but it is still wood, and thus has very poor [[weapons-grade|weapon qualities]]. A glumprong [[spiked ball]] or crossbow [[bolt]] will outperform one made of [[birch]], but cannot match one made out of [[copper]], let alone an ideal material like [[steel]]. Glumprong is slightly better as a cheap choice for mass production, but it is still vastly inferior to metal for any military application.

Some [[Dwarf|dwarves]] [[Preferences|like]] glumprongs for their ''living shadows''.
