{{Translation| dwarven = um| elvish  = thèdi| goblin  = olnge| human   = nato}}

'''Nails''', '''claws''' and '''talons''' are a product of some [[animal]]s when [[butcher]]ed. They are stored in a [[stockpile]] that accepts [[body parts]], and [[refuse|have no known use]].

Civilized creatures may occasionally wear [[jewelry]] made out of nails, despite it being uncraftable in [[fortress mode]].

{{D for Dwarf}}
Should not be confused with hardware nails, which currently do not exist in the game. All wooden [[Building|buildings]] can be constructed with [[wood]] alone. These are fingernails or toenails. Thus, your [[Military|dwarves]] will only use their [[War hammer|hammers]] for pounding the latter type of nail. Hopefully not their own thumbs (ouch!).
