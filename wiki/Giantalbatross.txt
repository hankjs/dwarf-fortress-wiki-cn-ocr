'''Giant albatrosses''' are the [[giant animal]] variant of the common [[albatross]], found in [[savage]] [[ocean]]s. They spawn in groups of 1-10 individuals, and will fly around aimlessly, fleeing when approached. They are roughly four times larger than a [[dwarf]], but are unlikely to provide a threat to a fortress.

Giant albatrosses can be captured in [[cage]] [[trap]]s and [[Animal trainer|trained]] into [[pet]]s. Like all other giant animals, they provide a decent amount of [[food]] and [[bone]]s when [[butcher]]ed, but breeding them is a subpar choice, due to the fact they lay only one [[egg]] at a time. Also like other giant animals, they are considered exotic [[mount]]s.

Some dwarves [[Preferences|like]] giant albatrosses for their ''large wings''.
