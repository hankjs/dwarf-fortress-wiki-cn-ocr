'''Yellow sand''' is one of the several types of [[sand]] that can be found in [[soil layer]]s. Yellow sand layers occasionally contain an [[aquifer]].

It can be gathered into [[bag]]s and used for the purpose of [[glassmaking]], and it can also be used for [[farming]] just like any other [[soil]] layer.
