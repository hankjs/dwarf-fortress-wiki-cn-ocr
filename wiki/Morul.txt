{{D for Dwarf}}

'''Morul Cattenmat, the Most Interesting Dwarf in the World''', is the result of forum-user Martin's quest to create the most interesting [[dwarf]] in history. Morul was created with the singular intent to get him to [[Legendary]] in every [[skill]] possible in [[Fortress Mode]]. Doing almost all of the work himself, Morul progressed from a simple dwarf with the near-useless [[Fish dissector|Fish Dissector]] and [[Animal Dissector]] skills into a demigod of epic proportions, capable of singlehandedly wiping out entire [[sieges]] of size 25/damblock 50 orcs all by himself. 


== Skill History ==

As of January 12, 2010, Morul has reached Legendary status in 71 skills and is now considered "complete".
