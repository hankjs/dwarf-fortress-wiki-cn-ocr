The position of '''count''' is the next step up from [[baron]]; once a player achieves certain requirements the [[outpost liaison]] will announce the elevation to a county, and when the liaison leaves the map the promotion will become official. In other words, lands must be a barony before they can be a county. Unlike with the barony offering, the upgrade to county is automatic and cannot be declined (though, should an [[unfortunate accident]] befall the liaison then the promotion will be deferred).  A count will upgrade to a [[duke]] under proper conditions.

Counts have been known to have long, storied careers as lever-pullers, though some flame out in the [[unfortunate accident|geonaut]] career path. It is not known if vampiric counts are excellent bookkeepers.
