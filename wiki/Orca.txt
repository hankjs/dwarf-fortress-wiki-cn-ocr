'''Orcas''' are [[aquatic]] [[creature]]s found living in any [[ocean]] [[biome]], appearing in groups of 3-9 individuals. They are among the largest mundane creatures in the ocean (losing only to the [[basking shark]], [[whale shark]] and [[sperm whale]]), but are benign and will ignore [[dwarves]] even if they somehow get close to them. In the event an orca is forced to fight, it will defend itself with bites and tail slaps, which due to its massive size, can be particularly deadly. An infant orca is called an ''orca calf''.

Being fully-sized creatures rather than [[vermin]], the only way to fish orcas is to trap them on land, typically with the use of a [[drowning chamber]], though they may occasionally [[Beaching|beach]] themselves into your hands without any effort on your part. Due to their massive size, they provide a fantastic amount of returns when [[butcher]]ed, enough to feed a fortress for quite a while, especially when it's still growing.

Some dwarves [[Preferences|like]] orcas for their ''coloration'' and their ''great jumps'' (even though in-game orcas are unable to jump at all).
