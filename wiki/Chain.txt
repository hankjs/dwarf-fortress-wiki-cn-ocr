[[File:ropes_preview.png|right]]'''Chains''' and '''Ropes''' are items used to make [[Traction_bench|traction benches]], [[well]]s, [[restraint]]s and [[minecart]] rollers. Ropes are not actually a distinct item type - they are merely what chains are called when they are made of cloth. 

They are both listed under the "chains" heading in the k-stocks menu, are stored in finished goods [[stockpile]]s, and are generally interchangeable.

Chains are created at the [[metalsmith's forge]] with one [[metal]] [[bar]] (or four [[adamantine]] wafers), using the [[metal crafter|metal craft]] [[skill]] (but are found listed under "Furniture" and not "other objects" in that menu). Ropes are created at the [[clothier's shop]] with one [[cloth]], using the [[clothier]] [[skill]].

Taking a rope with you at [[embark]] lets you construct a [[well]] more quickly. While it's usually much cheaper to take raw materials and produce ready goods after embark, the [[item value]] of a fiber rope is 20 vs. 12 of the [[thread]]. The dwarves will not enjoy using a base quality item as much, but cost-wise it matters 3 times less than the mechanism.  On the other hand, you can make 4 metal chains after smelting one copper ore (cost 6) into 4 bars once you have your forge up and running, but that won't happen as fast - lots to consider.

Chains and ropes are considered superior vs. [[cage]]s for dwarven [[justice]], as you can construct a bedroom around the restraint and allow the prisoner some mobility to use a bed, eat at a table and chair, and otherwise enjoy any fixtures of their "cell" that you have installed there.

* '''Bug''': When releasing a creature from a restraint, if you deconstruct the chain/rope first, the animal will then still have that around their neck - with no way to remove it, and no way to re-construct it elsewhere. If you value the chain or rope, take the time to first release the animal, ''then'' deconstruct the chain from its current location.  On the other hand, if you want a nifty ≡gold chain≡ as a permanent collar around the neck of a favorite guard tiger, this is how you'd get that.
