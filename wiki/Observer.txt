The '''Observer''' [[skill]] represents situational awareness: the ability of a [[creature]] to notice key details about their surroundings. For general patrol, this skill increases the chance to spot a [[ambusher|stealth]] unit; the higher the skill the greater the range{{verify}}. The skill is particularly good to have for [[military|guards]] at your entrance or marksdwarves on your walls.

The maximum detection range is currently unknown, although experiments suggest that it is much longer than the 3 tiles of previous versions. Detections at a range of 20 tiles have been reported.

In combat, the observer skill is used to note and anticipate the attacks of enemies. Skilled observers are less likely to be surprised by an opponent's charge, for instance, and less likely to receive a penalty for being attacked from the side. Higher skill levels give the observer more information, such as which arm the opponent is using for its next attack. 

[[Soldier]]s will gradually increase this skill while training. It is currently uncertain whether observing combat demonstrations improves observer skill directly, or if improvement is limited to [[sparring]] and [[combat]]. For targeted [[live training]], fighting a group of weak or harmless enemies should increase the number of observer rolls as your trainee is surrounded. However, Observer can also be trained just by witnessing a fight. IE; an arena with lots of opponents will also significantly train Observer, as long as the dwarves 'watching' the fights are close enough to observe the attacks.

In adventure mode, the Observer skill directly influences the level of detail shown when identifying opponents' attacks, and is used to locate hidden creatures and traps. It slowly increases during combat, by successfully spotting traps, and by walking near hidden creatures, whether detected or not. You are also able to speed up training of your '''Observer''' [[skill]] while dodging. Warning: Detecting giant cave spiders and giant brown recluse spiders may be ''more'' hazardous than remaining blissfully ignorant to their location.  In [[fortress mode]], however, this is simply used by [[scholar]]s who are [[naturalist]]s.
