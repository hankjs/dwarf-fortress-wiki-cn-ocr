'''Wax''' is a material [[screw_press|pressed]] from a [[honeycomb]]. Wax can be used to make [[craft]]s by a [[wax worker]]. [[Elves]] have nothing against buying those crafts.

[[Honeycomb]]s are produced by [[honey bee]]s at a [[hive]] and harvested as part of the [[beekeeping industry]]. A dwarf with the [[presser|pressing]] labor active, a [[screw press]], and empty [[jug]]s are required to press a honeycomb. A jug of [[honey]] is produced as a byproduct. [[Glob]]s of raw wax will be stored in a [[fat]] stockpile.

Wax has a low base value of 1, the same as [[wood]] or non-flux [[stone]].
