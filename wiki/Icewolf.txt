'''Ice wolves''' are [[evil]]-aligned versions of the common [[wolf]] who can be found in evil [[tundra]]s and [[glacier]]s. They are almost identical to their non-icy counterparts, save for their coloration and for being 10,000 cm³ larger, coming close to the size of an adult [[dwarf]]. This makes them potentially dangerous to civilians, though an equipped [[military]] squad will make short work of them. 
Ice wolves possess a [[pet]] value of 50, but lack the necessary tokens to be [[Animal trainer|trainable]].

Some dwarves [[Preferences|like]] ice wolves for their ''piercing howls''.

Ice wolves have a chance to [[pet|adopt]] [[humans]] with no [[knowledge]].
