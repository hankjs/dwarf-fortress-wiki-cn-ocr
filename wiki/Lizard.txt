'''Lizards''' are a species of [[hateable]] [[above ground]] [[vermin]] found in any area that is not [[biome|freezing]], but will not be found in winter. They are known to eat [[stockpile]]d [[food]], and some [[Dwarf|dwarves]] will get an unhappy [[thought]] from encountering one. They can be captured by [[trapper]]s and turned into [[pet]]s. All lizards possess Legendary [[skill]] in [[Climber|climbing]].

Some dwarves [[Preferences|like]] lizards for their ''beauty''.
