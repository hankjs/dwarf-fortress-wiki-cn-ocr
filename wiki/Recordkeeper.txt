'''Record keeper''' is a skill associated with the [[Bookkeeper]] appointed [[noble]]. It is used to determine how quickly the bookkeeper can take an [[stocks|inventory]] of the fortress and update the records to reflect any changes. It is trained by a bookkeeper doing the '''update stockpile records''' administrative [[labor]]. To do this, the bookkeeper needs at least a meager [[office]], created from a [[Throne|chair or throne]] (Since ''Meager'' is the lowest possible room quality, just a 1×1 room, i.e. just the throne or chair itself, suffices.). For more information on room quality, see [[Zone#Quality and value]].

As wealth and items are created or lost, (e.g. by dwarves, or [[Steals drink|thieves]], drinking up all your booze), the records will gradually deteriorate in precision, eventually ending up at the lowest precision rating. An assigned bookkeeper will therefore periodically update the records-how often depends on what precision they are trying to maintain, with the highest precision requiring the most work.

An experienced bookkeeper can easily maintain the highest precision level without working around the clock, even in large fortresses. Getting to the highest precision level is mostly a challenge only in the first 2 years or so.  

The record keeper skill is also used by [[scholars]] when thinking about [[topics]].
