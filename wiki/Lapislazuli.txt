'''Lapis lazulis''' are unremarkable, low-value [[gem]]s found in [[igneous intrusive]] stone layers, as well as within [[marble]].

== In real life ==
In addition to being used as a semi-precious stone, the intense blue colour of lapis lazuli led to its being ground up and used as a pigment in painting.

Contrary to the common belief, Lapis Lazuli cannot be used to empower weapons, tools and armor with magic, nor can it be used to [[dye]] things.
