'''Kenaf''' is an [[aboveground]] [[crop]] that is primarily used to make [[thread]] for the [[textile industry]]. 

Kenaf seeds can be milled into paste at a [[quern]] or [[millstone]], which in turn can be pressed into kenaf seed [[oil]] and a [[press cake]] at a [[screw press]].

Some [[dwarves]] [[Preferences|like]] kenaf plants for their ''flowers''.
