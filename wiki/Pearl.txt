'''Pearls''' are gemstones that don't actually exist in the game as of yet, though they are likely to feature in a future release.
The [[raw file|creature definitions]] for the [[mussel]] and [[oyster]] indicate that they leave pearls with {{token|PEARL|c}}, but the tag is unimplemented, they do not actually appear in the game, and there is no accessible job for harvesting them. However, orders to "decorate items with pearl" can still be issued from a [[craftsdwarf's workshop]], and these jobs can be performed if you add pearls to a creature's definitions so that it is yielded as a butchering return.

In the realm of organic materials that have yet to be implemented, pearls sit adjacent to [[amber]] and [[coral]]; all three have been present since initial release, but none have yet been established into the game.

<!-- Reference: the "pearly gates" leading to Heaven -->
If a material is [[mod]]ded into the game with {{token|PEARL|md}}, [[artifact]] gates made out of the material will sometimes generate in [[vault]]s.
