'''Sponges''' are [[aquatic]] [[creature]]s found in every above-ground [[water]] [[biome]] except [[murky pool]]s. They are completely immobile and benign, ignoring any attempts to interact with them save for being occasionally overcome with terror. Sponges cannot survive out of water - if the body of water they inhabit is drained, they will asphyxiate and die. If confronted in melee range, a sponge will defend itself with [[push]] attacks.

While popularly known across the community in older versions of ''Dwarf Fortress'' for its invulnerability due to its lack of a brain and blood (with emphasis given to their [[Giant sponge|giant cousins]]), sponges are exceptionally weak opponents in the current day. They are made out of unique sponge tissue, which is especially vulnerable to pulping damage from [[war hammer]]s and [[mace]]s, and slashing weapons, such as [[battle axe]]s, will easily cleave them asunder in a few blows. While they are nearly as large as a [[dwarf]], a sponge's push attack is unlikely to hurt anything much bigger than a [[dog]]. Sponges cannot be [[butcher]]ed and dwarves cannot naturally enter water, so your fortress is unlikely to have to worry about them beyond your [[hunter]]s occasionally trying to kill one.

Sponges possess a [[pet]] value of 10, but lack the necessary tokens to be [[Animal trainer|trainable]]. The fact they are both water-dwelling and immobile also presents a barrier, even if they were modded to be trainable.

Some dwarves [[Preferences|like]] sponges for their ''squishy texture''.
