'''Golden salve''' is an [[extract]] made from [[valley herb]]s, prepared by a [[thresher]] at a [[farmer's workshop]] using the "Process plants (to [[vial]])" job and a glass [[vial]]. Currently, golden salve has no use, save as a [[trade good]]. One valley herb will yield five [[liquid|units]] of golden salve, worth 100☼ each, for a total of 500☼ per vial; processing valley herbs purchased from caravans (and thus coming in stacks of five) will fill each vial with 25 units of salve, worth a total of 2500☼.

Because golden salve is stored in [[vial]]s, you will need to search for vials when moving goods to your trade depot, and then look inside the vial to confirm it has golden salve.
