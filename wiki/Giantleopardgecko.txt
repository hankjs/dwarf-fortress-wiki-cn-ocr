'''Giant leopard geckos''' are super-sized versions of the common [[leopard gecko]] who inhabit [[savage]] [[desert]]s. While their original counterparts are just [[vermin]], these [[creature]]s are over 3 times bigger than a [[dwarf]]. They are not particularly aggressive, but are carnivorous and will attack other creatures (including dwarves) who provoke them, potentially killing them. All giant leopard geckos are born with Legendary [[skill]] in [[Climber|climbing]].

Giant leopard geckos can be captured in [[cage]] [[trap]]s and [[Animal trainer|trained]] into [[pet]]s, possessing the standard giant creature pet value. They are born adults, fully-sized right after birth, and cannot be permanently tamed. They produce an adequate amount of products when [[butcher]]ed, but unlike most reptiles, they give live birth instead of laying [[egg]]s. They are exotic [[mount]]s and may be witnessed being ridden by [[Elf|elves]] during [[siege]]s.

Some dwarves [[Preferences|like]] giant leopard geckos for their ''coloration''.
