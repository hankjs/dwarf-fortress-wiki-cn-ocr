'''Giant swans''' are enlarged [[Creature|cousins]] of the common [[swan]], found in [[savage]] [[temperate]] [[lake]]s and [[marsh]]es. Despite being four and a half times larger than the average [[dwarf]], giant swans are as benign as their normal-sized counterparts and will pose little to no threat to a fortress, though much like normal swans, they'll scare animals out of their [[pasture]]s every time they fly close to them, leading to many distracted dwarves. Unlike normal swans, both [[gender]]s of giant ones have the same name, though hatchlings are still referred to as ''giant cygnets''.

Giant swans can be captured in [[cage]] [[trap]]s and [[Animal trainer|trained]] into [[pet]]s, possessing the standard high value of a giant creature. Their much bigger size compared to normal swans makes them an even better choice for a farm, as they produce much more returns when [[butcher]]ed. Giant swans are exotic [[mount]]s and can be used by [[Elf|elves]] during [[siege]]s.

Some dwarves [[Preferences|like]] giant swans for their ''beauty''.
