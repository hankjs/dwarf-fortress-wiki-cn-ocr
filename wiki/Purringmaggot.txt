'''Purring maggots''' are a type of [[cavern]]-living [[vermin]] notable for being the only underground source of [[milk]], known as [[dwarven milk]]. They can be obtained by [[Trapper|trapping]] them with [[animal trap]]s. They are [[hateable]] vermin and will inspire an unhappy [[thought]] in [[dwarves]] that detest them.

To obtain these maggots, you will need to discover the 2nd or 3rd cavern layer, then construct ({{menu icon|b|r|t}}) [[animal trap]]s on cave moss there, baiting them with meat or fish. A higher quality trap will increase the chances of catching a purring maggot instead of losing the bait.

Some dwarves [[Preference|like]] purring maggots for their ''comforting whirs''.

==Quirks==
* Only '''untamed''' purring maggots can be milked - if you tame them, they become unmilkable. {{Bug|3670}}
* Once you catch a purring maggot, be sure to assign it to a built [[cage]] for long-term storage, otherwise it will be left in the workshop after being milked. {{Bug|3668}}

==Trivia==

{{D for Dwarf}}

In [[main:Dwarf Fortress Talk|the 28th episode of Dwarf Fortress Talk]], an early sprite for [[Cheese|dwarven cheese]] was inspired by [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Casu_marzu Casu Marzu], a Sardinian cheese containing live maggots. The idea was forwarded by [http://www.bay12forums.com/smf/index.php?action=profile;u=61165 Meph], who drew a two-frame animation for it. This sprite was never publicly released, and dwarven cheese uses standard graphics rather than its own {{token|CHEESE_GRAPHICS|graphics}}, however, a reference to a non-existent 8-tile tilesheet of cheese graphics can still be found within the creature graphics definitions files which might have been the animated cheese.

This in turn spawned a discussion as to where the maggots in the cheese came from, as the milked maggot remains outside the cheese. Do the maggots lay, or contain, smaller maggots? Do they form maggot-chains, or are they like Matryoshka dolls? Maybe the "purring" of the purring maggot is a bunch of maggots inside the maggot, making a purring noise as they move around.
