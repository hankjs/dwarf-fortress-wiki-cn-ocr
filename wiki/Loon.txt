'''Loons''' are a species of [[Creature|bird]] found inhabiting [[temperate]] [[lake]]s, appearing in groups of anywhere between 1-4 individuals. They do little but fly through the air and are only slightly bigger than a [[cat]], being benign and harmless to all but the most unlucky of [[dwarves]].

Loons can be captured in [[cage]] [[trap]]s and [[Animal trainer|trained]] into cheap [[pet]]s. They produce [[butcher]]ing returns equivalent to a [[turkey]], though being flying wild animals, they are considerably harder to catch. If put in a [[nest box]], they lay an average of 3 [[egg]]s at a time, making them a subpar choice for [[egg production]].

Some dwarves [[Preferences|like]] loons for their ''coloration'' and their ''haunting call''.
