'''Grime''' is a brown-colored [[contaminant]] that makes [[water]] from [[murky pool]]s disgusting to drink. When in item form, the water will be described as "laced with grime". [[Ice]] mined from frozen murky pools will be described as "dirty ice", and will also be coated in grime.

Randomly generated creatures such as [[forgotten beast]]s may occasionally be composed of "grime and [[filth]]", giving them the appearance of [[miasma]] in the graphical version.
