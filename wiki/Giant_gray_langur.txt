'''Giant gray langurs''' are the giant counterparts of the common [[gray langur]] who inhabit most [[savage]] [[biome]]s, where they appear in loose groups of 5 to 10 individuals. While a normal langur is just a glorified [[rhesus macaque]], a giant langur is 5 times more massive than a [[dwarf]], and their combined size and numbers make them a real threat to unarmed civilians. Much like their normal cousins, giant gray langurs will attempt to [[Thief|steal]] [[Steals items|items]] and [[Steals food|food]] from your fortress, potentially leading your peasants to be assaulted by a swarm of massive, biting and scratching gray-furred monkeys unless measures are made to defend the fortress. All giant gray langurs are born with Legendary [[skill]] in [[Climber|climbing]].

Giant gray langurs may be captured in [[cage]] [[trap]]s and [[Animal trainer|trained]] into valuable [[pet]]s. They give a respectable amount of returns when [[butcher]]ed and capturing multiple langurs shouldn't be particularly difficult due to them appearing in groups, making them a potential choice for exotic livestock. They are exotic [[mount]]s and may be witnessed being ridden by [[Elf|elves]] during [[siege]]s.

Some dwarves [[Preferences|like]] giant gray langurs for their ''social nature'' and their ''vocalizations''.
