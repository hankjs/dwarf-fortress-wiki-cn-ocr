'''Stoats''' are tiny [[Creature|animals]] found in [[taiga]]s and [[tundra]]s. Only marginally larger than a [[weasel]], they're among the smallest creatures in the game who aren't [[vermin]], and their benign demeanor makes them harmless to virtually anything. A male stoat is called a ''stoat jack'', a female is called a ''stoat jill'' and a newborn is known as a ''stoat kit''.

Stoats may be captured in [[cage]] [[trap]]s and be [[Animal trainer|trained]] into low-value [[pet]]s. Hunted stoats are too small to be [[butcher]]ed, and slaughtered tame ones will only yield a [[skull]]. Stoats may live between 2-7 years, making them potentially longer-lived (if RNG is on your side) than weasels, if you decide to keep them around for whatever reason.

Some dwarves [[Preferences|like]] stoats for their ''ability to take down large prey''.
==Trivia==
Stoats share the same sprites as [[weasel]]s.

<!--Reference: Inscryption-->
Stoats are very good at [[Die|gambling]] with [[Paper|cards]], even though they are mere animals.
