'''Gauntlets''' are [[armor]] worn on any [[body part]] that can [[Creature_token#GRASP|grasp]], which for [[dwarf|dwarves]] are the hands. They are similar to mittens and gloves, but act as an armor layer and provide much more protection. Like other armor, gauntlets can be made of [[metal]], [[shell]], or [[bone]]. [[Elf|Elves]] sometimes bring [[wood]]en gauntlets in their [[Trading|caravans]].

Each crafting job takes one bar, and produces a pair of gauntlets -- one right-handed and one left-handed. The items from a single job may have different [[quality]] levels.  A [[strange mood]] will only produce one half of a pair of gauntlets.
