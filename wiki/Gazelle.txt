'''Gazelles''' are small [[Creature|animals]] who live in [[tropical]] [[savanna]]s and [[grassland]]s, where they appear in herds of 5-10 individuals. They are benign herbivores, smaller even than [[dog]]s, who spend their time meandering about aimlessly, vulnerable to any [[hunter]] or [[squad]] who wants to make target practice out of them, and they'll rarely fight back if confronted. A newborn gazelle is named a ''fawn''.

Gazelles can be captured in [[cage]] [[trap]]s and [[Animal trainer|trained]] into exotic [[pet]]s. They can be [[butcher]]ed for products equivalents to a [[goat]], which includes [[Horn|horns, hooves]] and [[Ivory|teeth]]. Trained gazelles are [[grazer]]s, and therefore require a constant source of [[grass]] to survive.

Some dwarves [[preferences|like]] gazelles for their ''grace''.
