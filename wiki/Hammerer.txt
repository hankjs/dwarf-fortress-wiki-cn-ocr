The '''hammerer''' is a [[noble]] who serves as the executioner of your [[fortress]], possessing no [[zone|room]] or [[furniture]] requirements.

Normally, a [[dwarf]] that has committed a crime will be subject to [[justice]] at the hands of your [[sheriff]] (later, the [[captain of the guard]]), who will imprison the criminal in [[jail]]. However, if the crime is deemed particularly heinous, the hammerer will execute the criminal by using a [[chain]] to restrain them, and then, using a [[weapon]] that uses the Hammerman [[combat skill]], will deliver 50 hammerstrikes; in most cases, a [[war hammer]] is used. While this typically results in the death of the criminal, it is possible for a particularly lucky and tough dwarf to survive the hammering, in which case they are released.

The hammerer is reserved for crimes considered "capital" according to dwarven [[ethic]]s, which would be oathbreaking, treason, slavery and killing another member of your [[civilization]] - out of these, only the last one applies to [[fortress mode]]. Hammerers will also be responsible for (attempts at) dealing with discovered [[vampire]]s. Hammerers are an ineffective way of killing vampires, however, as most non-military dwarves are not strong or skilled enough to kill one due to their enhanced toughness, leading them to free the vampire back into the fortress where it can murder innocents again.

If you are not willing to get your dwarves potentially killed by the justice force, it's better to simply not assign a hammerer at all. If you want a hammerer but would prefer to up the chances of dwarves surviving hammerstrikes, avoid letting them get their hands on a war hammer that's of high quality and made of some good metal like [[steel]] or [[silver]], and give them something of poorer ([[Main:Adamantine|or better]]) quality instead.

*In order for the hammerer to execute criminals, you must have an available chain in your jail - a [[cage]] cannot be used. If you have no available chains, the criminal's punishment will be automatically reduced to a beating.{{bug|5172}}

{{D for dwarf}}
There are multiple theories as to why the hammerer has such a huge role in dwarven politics. Experts claim that he serves no real purpose, as [[Main:Armok|Armok]] usually finds a way to punish any delinquent even if no hammerer exists - magma, [[Giant cave spider|justice spiders]] or [[Dwarven atom smasher|bridge mistakes]] usually lead to a criminal's <s>un</s>timely demise. Hammerers do, however, present a sort of a calming factor on a typical fortress, and give any unhappy dwarf a simple, just, and brutal(ly effective) way to let off steam.
