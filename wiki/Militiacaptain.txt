The '''militia captain''' is a [[noble]] in charge of a band of up to ten soldiers of the [[military|militia]]. They are directly subordinate to the [[militia commander]], which they are functionally identical to.

This noble position is special in that you can have more than one. When the militia captain slot is filled, a new militia captain slot is created at the end of the nobles list. If this new slot is filled, another captain slot will appear. In this manner, you can create as many squads as you desire. Militia captains can also be appointed by the militia commander in the {{menu icon|q}} [[squad]] screen.
