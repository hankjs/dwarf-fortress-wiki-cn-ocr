'''Grimelings''' are exceptionally rare, [[evil]]-aligned [[creature]]s found in evil [[wetland]]s, resembling humanoids made out of waterlogged weeds. They stand as tall as a [[human]] and spawn one at a time, lurking in the [[water]] and attacking [[dwarves]] who get too close. All grimelings possess Legendary [[skill]] in [[Climber|climbing]].

Grimelings are interesting creatures, different from the [[Troll|usual]] [[Strangler|evil]] [[Ogre|humanoid]] dwarf-harassers. They possess no organs to speak of, including internal ones such as hearts, guts, brains or even ''eyes'' (though they can still see through {{token|EXTRAVISION}}), feel no emotion or [[No Exert|exertion]], are [[No Pain|immune to pain]], fear and dizziness, and [[No Stun|cannot be stunned]]. [[Weapon]]s cannot get stuck on grimelings, their corpses do not produce [[miasma]] and they cannot be [[butcher]]ed even though they are not intelligent. While they are currently made of standard flesh and muscle, a comment in their raw files states they are supposed to be made of weeds, implying [[Main:Toady One|Toady One]] intends to turn them into actual plant monsters when he ever gets around to it. Grimelings are the only creatures in the game with the {{token|VEGETATION}} token.

Some dwarves [[Preferences|like]] grimelings for their ''slithering nature'' and their ''weedy bodies''.

==Trivia==
*Initially, the premium version had a sprite for a child grimeling. It was later removed from the game, because grimelings are adults at birth.<br>[[File:grimeling_sprites.png]]
