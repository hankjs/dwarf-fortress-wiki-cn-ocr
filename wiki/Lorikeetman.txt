'''Lorikeet men''' are [[animal people]] variants of the common [[lorikeet]], who inhabit [[savage]] [[mangrove]]s and [[tropical]] moist broadleaf [[forest]]s. They spawn in groups of anywhere between 5-10 individuals and are generally content to keep to themselves. In terms of size, they are a little over half the weight of the average [[dwarf]]. All lorikeet men are born with Legendary [[skill]] in [[Climber|climbing]].

Like other savage animal people, lorikeet men can join [[civilization]]s, become [[historical figure]]s, appear as [[visitor]]s and be playable in [[adventurer mode]].

Some dwarves [[Preferences|like]] lorikeet men for their ''bright coloration'' and their ''playful personalities''.
