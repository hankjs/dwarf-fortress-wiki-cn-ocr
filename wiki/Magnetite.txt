'''Magnetite''' is an [[ore]] of [[iron]] a mid-value metal useful for weapons and armor. , It appears as large, oval-shaped [[Vein|cluster]]s inside [[sedimentary layer]]s and small clusters in [[metamorphic layer]]s and [[igneous layer]]s. A magnetite cluster may sometimes contain [[vein]]s of [[native platinum]], which can continue outside of the cluster itself.

In terms of [[Metalsmith|metalsmithing]], magnetite is identical to [[hematite]] and [[limonite]], producing four [[iron]] [[bars]] when smelted at a [[smelter]]. However, magnetite is distinguished by the extreme size of each deposit compared to the other iron ores, for sedimentary clusters anyway. While a vein might hold 100 tiles of ore, a cluster can contain around 750 -- this is offset somewhat by the 25% lower chance for a [[mine]]d tile to drop an [[ore]] boulder, compared to vein stone, but the typical yield of the entire large cluster is still much higher.

==In the real world==
Magnetite is the most magnetic of all the naturally occurring minerals.  It is often found in the form of [[black sand]].

<!-- Reference: Magnite (Deep Rock Galactic) -->
Magnetite is silvery in color, not red with black specks. It also does not generate more frequently in [[Glacier|glaciers]] or the [[Magma sea|fourth layer of the caverns]].
