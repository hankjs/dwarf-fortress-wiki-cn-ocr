'''Milkfish''' are a species of [[Creature|fish]] who can be found in [[tropical]] [[ocean]]s, [[lake]]s and [[river]]s, in clusters of 3-7 individuals. Very small in size, they provide only a small amount of returns when [[butcher]]ed. As non-[[vermin]] fish, milkfish can't be fished by [[Fisherdwarf|fisherdwarves]], but can be caught with the use of a [[drowning chamber]]. Infant milkfish are called ''milkfish fry''.

Some dwarves [[Preferences|like]] milkfish for their ''silvery bodies''.

Despite their name, milkfish can not be [[milk]]ed.
