'''Giant green tree frogs''' are much larger [[Creature|cousins]] of the common [[green tree frog]], found in [[savage]] [[temperate]] freshwater [[biome]]s where they spawn one at a time. Despite being as big as a [[giant cave toad]], these frogs are benign and will run away from [[dwarves]] who approach them, only fighting if cornered. While a civilian can get hurt if they get entangled into a fight with one, they should pose no threat to a [[hunter]] or a half-competent [[military]] squad. All giant green tree frogs are born with Legendary skill in [[Climber|climbing]].

Giant green tree frogs can be captured in [[cage]] [[trap]]s and [[Animal trainer|trained]] into [[pet]]s, possessing the standard high value of a giant creature. They produce an average amount of [[meat]], [[bone]]s and [[fat]] when [[butcher]]ed, making them a choice for a [[meat industry]] if a breeding pair is obtained. They are considered exotic [[mount]]s, so you may see [[elves]] riding them into battle in the event of a [[siege]].

Some dwarves [[Preferences|like]] giant green tree frogs for their ''distinct mating call''.
