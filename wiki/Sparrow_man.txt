'''Sparrow men''' are [[animal people]] variants of the common [[sparrow]] who inhabit many [[savage]] [[biome]]s. They spawn in groups of anywhere between 5-10 individuals and are generally content to keep to themselves. In terms of size, they are a little over half the weight of the average [[dwarf]]. All sparrow men are born with Legendary [[skill]] in [[Climber|climbing]].

Like other savage animal people, sparrow men can join [[civilization]]s, become [[historical figure]]s, appear as [[visitor]]s and be playable in [[adventurer mode]].

Some dwarves [[Preferences|like]] sparrow men for their ''dust baths'' and their ''lovely songs''.

<!--Reference: Pirates of the Caribbean-->
Sparrow men are known for their habit of endeavors in piracy. Beware, if you let young female nobles stay near [[fun]] coasts, reanimated skeletons of [[human]]s may take her, prompting a sparrow man to drag along your [[smith]] to rescue her.

<!--Reference: Touhou Project-->
Rumours of sparrow women making [[prepared meal]]s using [[sea lamprey]] late at night have yet to be verified.
