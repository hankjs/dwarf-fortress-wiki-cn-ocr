'''Longland grass''' is an [[above ground|aboveground]] [[crop]]. It can be [[milling|milled]] into [[Flour|Longland flour]] or [[brewing|brewed]] into [[Alcohol|Longland beer]]. 

It is equal in value to underground crops and is much like an aboveground version of [[cave wheat]], though its [[seed]]s take only about 25 days to grow, rather than the 42 required for cave wheat, and they can be planted in any season.

Some [[dwarves]] [[Preferences|like]] Longland grass for its ''sweeping stalks''.

==Trivia==
The first letter of Longland is capitalized in the raw code for Longland grass, unlike all other plant and creature names, where the name and adjective definitions are all lowercase.
