An '''account''' is an abstract number that traces the amount of wealth of a given entity ([[Company|companies]], [[guild]]s, etc.) or [[historical figure]]. Although the game doesn't (yet) have a proper [[economy]], the account system gives some targets for corruption mechanisms such as embezzlement (which shifts 'funds' from a site to a person) or sabotage (which abstractly reduces a site's funds). In addition, wealthy [[historical figure]]s with a large account may grab [[house]]s or towers in [[town]]s. [[Mercenary]] companies also draw funds from their account to upgrade their weapons, and may disband if they go broke.
