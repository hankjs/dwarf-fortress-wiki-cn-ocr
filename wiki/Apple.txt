'''Apple''' is one of the many genera of [[tree]]s found above ground. Like most trees, apple [[wood]] is brown and produces brown products.

Apple trees bear apples that can be harvested by setting up a gathering [[zone]]. They can be eaten raw, cooked, or brewed into delicious [[alcohol|apple cider]], so you may consider exploiting them, rather than chopping them down to make [[charcoal]]. They also drop leaves, which can be collected in bags. Apple leaves are not cookable or brewable, though they can be made into [[dye]].

Logs and leaves can be processed in a [[dyer's shop]] into [[dye|dyes]] - logs for rose and leaves for yellow.

Some [[Dwarf|dwarves]] [[Preferences|like]] apple trees for their ''fruit''.

<!-- Reference: Sir Isaac Newton -->
An apple once fell on the head of a [[scholar]], smashing his head into his body, an unrecognizable mass. Thus, the field of [[physics|dwarven physics]] was born.

<!-- Reference: Apple, Inc. and the rivalry between macOS, Windows, and Linux -->
Apples were invented by two [[human]]s named Steve. A well-documented but little understood phenomenon among humans is that a [[preference]] for [[window]]s strongly correlates with an intense dislike for apples, and vice versa. Curiously, humans who like [[penguin]]s tend to have a profound distaste for both.
