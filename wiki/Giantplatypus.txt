The males are armed with a non-lethal venom, that can be injected if they wound someone with their rear paws, causing extreme pain and minor swelling.

Some dwarves admire giant platypuses for their ''great size'', their ''bizarre appearance'', their ''venomous spurs'', their ''flat tails'' and their ''large bills''.
