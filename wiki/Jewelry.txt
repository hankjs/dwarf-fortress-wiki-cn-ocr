[[File:jewelry_sprites_preview.png|right]][[Finished goods#Crafts|Crafts]] that can be worn are considered '''jewelry''', these include amulets, crowns, bracelets, earrings and rings. Jewelry can provide [[armor|protection]] from damage, but does so rarely, as the coverage is minimal. Wearing jewelry does not interfere with wearing other items. [[Dwarf|Dwarves]] who wear [[Quality|high-quality]] jewelry may get happy thoughts from "putting on an exceptional/masterwork item" or from "making a satisfying acquisition".  Most jewelry can be made from [[metal]], [[bone]], [[cloth]], [[horn]], [[ivory]], [[leather]], [[rock]], [[shell]], or [[wood]].  [[Pearl]] could also be used if it existed.
__NOTOC__

==Types of Jewelry==

===Amulets===
[[File:amulet_sprite.png]] / {{Tile|♀|7:1}} Amulets are worn on the head, presumably this models things worn around the neck in the real world, like necklaces. The equipment limit is not known.

===Crowns===
[[File:crown_sprite.png]] / {{Tile|µ|7:1}} Crowns are worn on the head as a [[Armor#Layers|cover layer]] item. Unlike other jewelry, a crown provides 20 [[Armor#Coverage|coverage]], so has a chance to deflect attacks directed at the head (as evidenced [[:File:Crown+Helm Combat Report.png|here]]). Unfortunately, crowns also conflict with helms. Dwarves can somehow wear multiple crowns at once, with the highest reported count being at least forty-seven crowns.  Crowns cannot be made from cloth or leather.

===Bracelets===
[[File:bracelet_sprite.png]] / {{Tile|Ö|7:1}} Bracelets are worn on the hands. The equipment limit is not known.

===Earrings===
[[File:earrings_sprite.png]] / {{Tile|δ|7:1}} Eleven earrings can fit on each ear. Earrings will be put first on the right ear, then on the left ear, alternating until both are full.{{verify}}

===Rings===
[[File:ring_sprite.png]] / {{Tile|ö|7:1}} Rings can be worn on the fingers and toes. Rings will be put first on the right thumb; then on the left thumb; then on the right index finger; then on the left index finger; and so on. Once all the fingers have a ring, rings will be put on the toes, starting with the first right toe; then first left toe; etc.;  looping until each digit has eleven rings for a total of 220 rings.  Rings cannot be made from cloth or leather.

==Trophies==
Sometimes, during [[world generation]], when one [[historical figure]] kills another, that figure will be wearing a piece of jewelry made from the remains of its victim when you encounter it in [[adventurer mode]] or [[fortress mode]]. For example, the goblin general leading invaders to attack your fortress might be wearing a +dwarf tooth ring+ from the hapless dwarven soldier they struck down fifty years ago. The trophy behavior is controlled by an [[ethics]] tag in the entity raws. You may have migrants or guests with equipped trophies.

==Adventurer mode==
Jewelry does not interfere with adventurers wearing armor or clothing. Crowns and amulets are worn on the head over helms, earrings on alternating ears. Bracelets are worn on alternating hands over gloves and under gauntlets, and rings on alternating digits, starting with thumbs, then fingers, and lastly toes. There is a soft limit of 99 items per location, such that once all locations for an item type have 99 items on them, any more worn will always go on the first location. For example, if a creature has 99 earrings on each ear, wearing more will put them only on the right ear. There is effectively no limit for items with only one location, like crowns (their weight does add up, though).



{{D for Dwarf}}
<!-- Reference: JRR Tolkien's The Silmarilion, edited by Christopher Tolkien ---> 
There is a small chance during [[world generation]] for an [[Angel]] to disguise itself as an [[Elf]], after which the disguised angel will persuade an elf with legendary [[metalcrafting]] skill to create seven [[gold]] Rings, that will then be distributed to seven [[dwarf]] monarchs. Allegedly, these seven rings are what cause fortresses to mine deep enough to breach the [[Underworld]] in an ever-growing need for wealth. It is unknown why the angel does this.
