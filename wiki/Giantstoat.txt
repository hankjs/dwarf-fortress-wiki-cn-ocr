'''Giant stoats''' are enlarged versions of the common [[stoat]] who can be found in [[savage]] [[taiga]]s and [[tundra]]s. While the regular animal is tiny, their giant cousins are about three times larger than a [[dwarf]], though they possess the same benign disposition which makes them harmless in most cases. Unlike normal stoats, male and female are named the same thing, but the young are still known as ''giant stoat kits''.

Giant stoats may be captured in [[cage]] [[trap]]s and [[Animal trainer|trained]] into [[pet]]s, possessing the standard value of a savage giant creature. They are large enough to grant food when [[butcher]]ed, giving about the same amount of meat and bones as an [[alpaca]]. They're as short-lived as normal stoats, making them poor long-term companions for dwarves.

Some dwarves [[Preferences|like]] giant stoats for their ''ability to take down large prey''.
