"'''Spores'''" is an informal player term not found in the game, but often used in the community. It can refer to one of two things:

:* Spores from [[caverns]] (or old [[40d:underground river|underground river]]s) that allow underground shrubs and trees to grow in soil or muddy areas.
:* In versions before v0.40.19, the ability of DF dwarves and creatures to "[[breeding#Breeding|breed]] by spores".
