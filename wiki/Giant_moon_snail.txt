'''Giant moon snails''' are much larger than a normal [[moon snail]], roughly the size of an average [[llama]]. this can make their [[push]] attacks dangerous since they are so much larger than a dwarf. They provide two [[shell]]s when butchered, which can prove useful during a [[strange mood]].

They dwell in savage temperate [[ocean]] [[biome]]s. Dwarves can apparently [[preference|prefer]] giant moon snails for their predatory nature or their striking coloration.
