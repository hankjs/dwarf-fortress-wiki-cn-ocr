'''Fine pewter''' is an [[alloy]] of [[tin]] and [[copper]].

Fine pewter can be made using one of the following recipes:
*3 [[Tin]] bars + 1 [[Copper]] bar = 4 Fine pewter bars
*3 [[Cassiterite]] + 1 [[Native copper]], [[Malachite]], or [[Tetrahedrite]] = 16 Fine pewter bars

Fine pewter has a material value of 5. This represents a significant increase over its component parts (which all have a value of 2), making fine pewter suitable for creating mid-value furniture and items. If you have an abundance of tin, this is the best form of [[pewter]] to make. 

Note that [[bronze]] uses the same ingredients (though in different proportions), has the same material value, and is also useful as a mid-grade [[weapon]]s material, while [[bismuth bronze]] is more valuable. However, you can produce 16 bars of fine pewter with a single unit of [[fuel]] (when smelting from [[ore]]s), giving fine pewter a slight advantage over bronze if fuel is constrained.
