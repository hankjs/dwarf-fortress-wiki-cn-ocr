The '''metalsmith's forge''' is a [[workshop]] used by [[dwarf|dwarves]] to turn [[metal|metal bars]] into useful objects such as [[weapon|weapons]], [[armor]], [[furniture]], [[Currency|coins]], [[ammunition]] for [[siege]] equipment and [[crossbow|crossbows]], [[trap component]]s, and other [[finished goods]].  Depending on the generated world, musical [[instrument]] components may or may not be built here. To build a forge, you must have [[fire-safe]] materials and an [[anvil]]. Every use of the forge, except for [[Decoration|stud]]ding, consumes one unit of [[fuel]] ([[coke]] or [[charcoal]]).

Note that the anvil used to build a metalsmith's forge ''does'' need to be fire-safe—normally anvils can only be made from fire-safe materials, but [[strange mood]]s can create artifact anvils out of metals like [[tin]], which are entirely unusable.

Curiously, the name of this workshop will change if your fortress's primary race provides a custom value for the {{token|PROFESSION_NAME|c|METALSMITH}} token.

==Workshop labors and skills==
All metallic end products are created at a metalsmith's forge, using four of the five [[Metal industry|metalsmithing]] skills (the exception being [[smelting]]):
* [[Weaponsmith]]s can create [[weapon]]s, [[trap]] components, [[bolt]]s, and [[ballista arrowhead]]s
* [[Armorsmith]]s create [[armor]]
* [[Metal crafter]]s create [[chain]]s and "Other Objects" ([[craft]]s, [[Currency|coins]], [[goblet]]s), musical [[instrument]] components, as well as performing [[Decoration|stud]]ding
* [[Blacksmith]]s create [[anvil]]s, [[block]]s, and all [[furniture]] except chains
* [[Trapping|Trappers]] create animal traps.
* [[Mechanic|Mechanics]] create mechanisms.

==Cost of items==
The cost of a [[weapon]] or piece of [[armor]] in metal [[bar]]s can be calculated by using material size/3 and rounding down, with no item costing less than one metal bar. The exception to this is some types of finished goods, which are created in different multiples from a single metal bar, depending on the skill of the [[metal crafter]]. The table on the [[Melt item]] page lists the cost of common items and their yields when melted.

==Size==
To create differently sized armor for non-dwarf residents, request it to be made from the workshop as usual. Afterwards, go back to the main workshop menu and look at the details of the issued job ([[File:Mag glass icon.png]]). Search for the race you want to make the item for and choose it.
