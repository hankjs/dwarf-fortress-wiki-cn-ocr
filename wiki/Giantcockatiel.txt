'''Giant cockatiels''' are [[giant animal]] counterparts of regular [[cockatiel]]s, who spawn in [[savage]] [[desert]]s and [[temperate]] [[grassland]]. Unlike their basal equivalents, giant cockatiels are larger than a [[grizzly bear]]. They appear in clusters of 5-10 individuals, and may cause annoyances to a fortress, primarily through job cancelations. 

Giant cockatiels are difficult to capture and difficult to hunt, but they can be used to start an exotic [[egg production|egg farm]], if you manage to nab a breeding pair. Because they are flying savage birds, they may cause problems on the sliver of a chance that they appear in an [[elf|elven]] [[siege]]. Unlike their brethren, they lay [[egg]]s two to eight a clutch.

Some dwarves [[Preferences|like]] giant cockatiels for their ''crests''.
