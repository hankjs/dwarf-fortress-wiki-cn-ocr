'''Bilous''' are a rare species of gibbon who inhabit [[tropical]] moist broadleaf [[forest]]s, where they always appear in pairs. Only slightly larger than the average [[cat]], these [[creature]]s are harmless to [[dwarves]] and serve as little more than a distraction for your civilians. All bilous are born with Legendary [[skill]] in [[Climber|climbing]].

Bilous can be captured in [[cage]] [[trap]]s and [[Animal trainer|trained]] into valuable exotic [[pet]]s. Due to their small size and rarity, they make poor targets for a [[meat industry]]. While they reach their full size at the age of 2, bilous don't reach adulthood until the age of 7.

Some dwarves [[Preferences|like]] bilous for their ''beautiful songs'' and their ''ability to swing through the trees''.
