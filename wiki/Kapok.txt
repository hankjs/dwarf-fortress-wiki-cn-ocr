'''Kapoks''' are a type of [[above ground]] [[tree]], found only in [[tropical]] [[forest]]s. Like the overwhelming majority of overland trees, kapok [[wood]] is brown and produces brown products. 

Kapok wood is the fourth lightest in the game. Items that need to be hauled a lot, such as [[bin]]s and [[barrel]]s, would benefit from being made out of this wood, if the [[Candlenut|other]] [[Papaya|tree]] [[Feather tree|types]] don't grow in your area.

Some [[Dwarf|dwarves]] [[Preferences|like]] kapoks for their ''buttresses''.
