'''Blind cave bears''' are large [[caverns|subterranean]] predators that appear only one at a time to hunt [[Dwarf|dwarves]]. Unlike bears of the surface world ([[black bear]]s, [[grizzly bear]]s or [[polar bear]]s), blind cave bears are not attracted by [[food]] or [[alcohol|drink]] and cannot be lured into [[trap]]s with anything less than either blind luck or a strategically placed [[Defense_guide#Animals|kitten on a rope]]. They are not actually blind, at least not really, possessing the {{token|EXTRAVISION|c}} tag despite having no eyes - the end result is that (ironically) they cannot be blinded. They are also of the {{token|LARGE_PREDATOR|c}} class, which means that they will opportunistically attack any dwarves that approach - unless that dwarf happens to be a [[skill|great]] [[battle axe|axedwarf]] in full [[steel]] [[armor]], they're not likely to survive the encounter. Compared to most other cavern creatures who can appear in the first cavern layer, blind cave bears are quite uncommon to encounter.

They can be trapped and trained by an [[animal trainer]] and make decent [[pet]]s. They are also useful dead: blind cave bear parts and products are worth three times as much as those of domestic animals, and a single bear will keep a [[bone carver]] busy for a while. [[Goblin]]s have been known to arrive on them during [[siege]]s. Unlike most creatures, they can't be spawned in the [[object testing arena]].

Some dwarves [[Preferences|like]] blind cave bears for their ''drooping ears''.
