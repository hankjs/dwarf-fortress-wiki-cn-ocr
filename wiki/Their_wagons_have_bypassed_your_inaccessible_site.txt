This error message appears if a [[merchant]] tries to arrive with [[wagon]]s but there is no wagon-accessible path to your [[trade depot]] (or you don't have a trade depot at all). If you get this message, it is too late to do anything about it for the current caravan - the wagons will '''not''' enter the map, but any pack animals will still show up and try to find their way to your depot.

To fix this error for the ''next'' caravan, do one of the following:
* Build a [[trade depot]] in an already-accessible place.
* Make a path, at least three tiles wide, from your current trade depot to the edge of the map with no obstructions. You may need to cut down [[tree]]s, smooth [[boulder]]s, or use [[ramp]]s and [[mine]]d passageways. Build [[road]]s through any vegetation to ensure that no new plants grow up to disrupt the path in the future.
* Wagons need a 3x4 tile 'parking space' next to the trade depot so they can unload their wares.
