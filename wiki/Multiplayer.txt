''Dwarf Fortress'' is, at its core, a single-player game. The game was designed and built from the ground up to be played by a single person, there is no multiplayer support, and no indication that it is ever going to be planned, even in the (very) far-reaching timeline envisioned by the Adams brothers. 

''However'', it is possible, most often through unofficial and [[Utility:DFHack|hacky]] methods, to enjoy a multiplayer-like experience of the game, depending on your definition of 'multiplayer'. 

*'''[[Main:Succession games|Succession]]''': in which players take turns controlling a single fortress or adventurer and pass the save file around. No specific implementation is needed, just a forum for communication to agree on the specifics. Many such threads are hosted on the Bay 12 forums, on the [http://www.bay12forums.com/smf/index.php?board=14.0 DF Community Games & Stories board].

*'''Hotseat''': a single instance of the game runs, but the controls are shared among multiple players. This can be done over telnet with [[Utility:Dfterm2|Dfterm2]] ([http://www.bay12forums.com/smf/index.php?topic=50643.0]) or over a web interface with [[Utility:Dfterm3|Dfterm3]] ([http://www.bay12forums.com/smf/index.php?topic=129995.0 ]) or [http://www.bay12forums.com/smf/index.php?topic=139975 DF Everywhere].

*'''Co-op''': a single instance of the game runs, but different screens are rendered to different players. This is implemented through [http://www.bay12forums.com/smf/index.php?topic=176070.0 dfplex].

*'''[http://www.bay12forums.com/smf/index.php?topic=165168.0 Arena mode]''': a single instance of the game on Arena mode runs, and players 'control' a single unit (in reality, the AI controls it and DFHack transmits the human instructions).
