[[File:personality_v50_preview.png|thumb|262px|right|Randomly generated personality of a [[miner]].]]

'''Personality values''', as distinct from [[attributes]] and [[mannerism]]s, can be found for a creature in the second sub-tab of the "Personality" tab of its character sheet. In general, these do not have as important a gameplay effect as attributes, at least for skill rolls, but they have a major effect on how a dwarf reacts emotionally to various circumstances, which can have [[mental breakdown|crippling effects.]]

These describe a creature's beliefs; examples include things like [[#TRADITION|tradition]] ("He/she holds the maintenance of tradition as one of the highest ideals"), [[#COOPERATION|cooperation]] ("...is thoroughly disgusted by cooperation"), and [[#SACRIFICE|sacrifice]] ("...believes that those who sacrifice for others should be deeply respected"). Values can conflict with [[personality facet|facets]], but this doesn't mean they are incompatible. For instance, it's possible a dwarf will deeply value [[#ROMANCE|romance]], even though one of their personality facets prevents him/her from [[Personality facet#LOVE_PROPENSITY|forming romantic bonds]]. This particular combination would show up in the "Traits" sub-tab of the "Personality" tab of the creature's character screen as "S/he never falls in love or develops positive feelings toward anything, and s/he is bothered by this since s/he sees romance as one of the highest ideals".

S/he {{DFtext|personally values romance, finds maintaining decorum a silly, fumbling waste of time, values tranquility and a peaceful day and doesn't care about art one way or another.|3:1}}

Each value has a range from −50 to 50. The value triggers a report (except for the -10 to +10 range, which does not) on the "Values" sub-tab of the "Personality" tab of a creature's character sheet, depending on where it falls in any of seven levels:
{| class="wikitable"
! Value range !! Values in range !! Probability !! Effect
|-
| +41 to +50 || 10 || 0.4%  || Highest
|-
| +26 to +40 || 15 || 2%    || Very High
|-
| +11 to +25 || 15 || 8.5%  || High
|-
| −10 to +10 || 21 || 78%   || Neutral
|-
| −25 to −11 || 15 || 8.5%  || Low
|-
| −40 to −26 || 15 || 2%    || Very Low
|-
| −50 to −41 || 10 || 0.4%  || Lowest
|}

Values are also influenced by cultural values via the use of the VALUE [[entity token]]. For example, dwarven civilizations hold craftsdwarfship in the highest regard, whereas goblins hold the ideas of fairness and sacrifice in utter disdain. If an individual person's values differ significantly from their civilization's values, then that value gets highlighted in cyan in the traits tab. Values, along with traits, dictate [[need]]s and the frequency with which they need to be fulfilled before the focus of the dwarf/adventurer is negatively impacted.

Values can also be changed through successful arguments – in adventure mode, this can be used to change the core values of your adventurer (and, consequently, some of their needs). Since they can argue for values they don't actually hold, you can convince a person of a value you ''want'' your adventurer to hold, get into ''another'' argument over said value, and acquiesce to that (new) position. Note that traits cannot be changed in this way, although they may be subject to changing due to events that happen in your character's adventures.{{verify}} In fortress mode, some [[Memory (thought)|memories]] have the potential to change values over time.

For a creature to have values, it needs the ability to [[Learning|learn]] or [[Speaking|speak]]. Certain values can conflict with personality traits.
