'''Black-caps''' are a type of [[underground]] [[tree]] found in the lower levels of [[caverns]] near the [[water]]. Unsurprisingly, they yield black logs when cut down. Due to their color, live black-caps saplings are indistinguishable from trampled ones.

Some [[Dwarf|dwarves]] [[Preferences|like]] black-caps for their ''gloomy appeal''.
