:[[File:v50_standing_orders_preview.png|300px|right]]'''''Standing orders''' are non-military orders that apply to the entire fortress, including civilians. If you were looking for information on how to get your military to patrol or defend areas without actively managing them, see '''[[Scheduling]]'''. If you were looking for information on how to order your squads to move around on command and attack designated creatures, see '''[[Squads]]'''.

'''Standing orders''' that apply to the whole fortress can be accessed by opening the Labor menu with {{Menu icon|y}} and then clicking on the '''Standing orders''' tab.

==Automated Workshops==
* '''Automatically weave all thread''' toggles whether [[loom]]s will automatically weave available thread (or available dyed thread) into cloth
* '''Use any cloth''' toggles whether [[clothier's shop]]s will use only dyed cloth or all cloth. Since finished clothing cannot be dyed, this is one way to make sure the clothing is of the best quality possible.
* '''Automatically collect webs''' toggles whether [[weaver]]s will automatically go out and collect spider [[web]]s
* '''Slaughter any marked animal''' toggles whether animals marked for slaughter will automatically add slaughter tasks to [[butcher's shop]]s

==Hauling==
* '''Workers gather animals''' toggles whether dwarves will move caged [[animal]]s to a stockpile
* '''Workers gather food''' toggles whether dwarves will move [[food]] to a stockpile

* '''Workers gather bodies''' toggles whether dwarves will move [[corpse]]s to a stockpile

==Refuse and dumping==
Dwarves can do different things with different types of [[refuse]].

You can tell them to ignore refuse altogether by toggling off '''Workers gather refuse''' for a smelly fort, or toggle on '''Workers gather outdoor refuse''' which is mainly useful for collecting animals killed by military dwarves.

Various refuse types can be toggled between "save" (bring to a stockpile) and "dump" (throw in a garbage dump [[activity zone]]). Setting a type of refuse as "dump" will make dwarves start automatically dumping refuse of that type, even ones pre-stored in a refuse stockpile.

NOTE: If you have outdoor refuse stockpiles set up with give and take chains (to shift garbage away from your fortress, for example,) you must turn on collecting outdoor refuse if you want your dwarves to move the piles.

*'''Workers gather refuse''' toggles whether dwarves will ignore refuse completely
*'''Workers gather outdoor refuse''' toggles whether dwarves will gather refuse [[Tile_attributes|outside]]
*'''Workers ignore outdoor vermin remains''' toggles whether dwarves will gather [[vermin]] remains from outside (only available when '''Workers gather outdoor refuse''' is on)
*'''Workers save corpses''' toggles whether [[corpse]]s, [[body part]]s, and other parts not applied to the options below are stored or dumped, including [[Ivory|ivory/teeth]], [[horn]]s, [[nervous tissue]], and [[cartilage]]
*'''Workers save skulls'''  toggles whether [[skull]]s are stored or dumped
*'''Workers save bones''' [[bone]]s are stored or dumped
*'''Workers save shells'''  [[shell]]s are stored or dumped
*'''Workers save skins'''  toggles whether [[skin]]s, [[chitin]] or [[scale]]s are stored or dumped
*'''Workers save hair and wool''' toggles whether [[hair]] or [[wool]] are stored or dumped
*'''Workers save other objects''' toggles other refuse not mentioned above, including vermin remains, rotten products, withered plants, damaged furniture, or [[Wear|tattered]] clothes ("Gather Vermin Remains" must be on for outdoor vermin remains to be collected)

==Sieges and forbidding==
Dwarves can automatically [[forbid]] certain types of items, automatically forbid these items only during sieges, or not automatically forbid them at all.
*'''Forbid used ammunition''' toggles whether shot ammunition is automatically forbidden
*'''Claim your dead''' toggles whether dead citizens are automatically forbidden

*'''Forbid cages from sprung traps''' toggles whether filled cages from traps will be automatically forbidden

==Chores==
The Chores tab allows you to select what tasks [[children]] will automatically do. You can select '''Children don't do chores''' to forbid all children from doing work tasks or toggle tasks from the list of "Feeding Patients/Prisoners", "Milking", hauling tasks, "Cleaning", and "Lever Operation". The tab lists all of the children in your fort and you can also select individual children to do either all or none of the tasks you've selected. If either list has a scroll bar, only click the arrows at the top and bottom of the scroll bar to scroll the list; otherwise (after scrolling) the selecting and deselecting of children or options might not work (until the menu is closed and reopened){{bug|13461}}.

==Other==
*'''Announce some job cancellations''' adjusts the level of job cancellation announcements that are shown
*'''Everybody harvests''' toggles who will harvest plants from [[farm plot|farm plots]] - if set to "Everybody harvests", all dwarves will participate, including [[nobles]] and [[children]].

*'''Prefer zones for water drinking''' toggles whether dwarves can drink at water sources not marked as zones.
*'''Prefer zones for fishing''' toggles whether fisherdwarves can fish at water sources not marked as zones.
