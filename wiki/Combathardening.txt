Whenever a creature is repeatedly exposed to typical violence and death from combat, they will progressively '''harden''' and feel less and less [[emotion]]s from it. This system is distinct from [[stress]] and historically predates it, even though it has an influence on how stressed your dwarves get.

There are four different levels: no hardening, "is getting used to tragedy", "is a hardened individual" and "doesn't really care about anything anymore". As of .47.05, your dwarves will reach this level fairly quickly, even civilians. Any further occurrence of violence at this level will cause them to "not feel anything". 

Note that non-dwarf citizens who reach this level become [[alcohol]]-dependent, just like normal dwarves.
