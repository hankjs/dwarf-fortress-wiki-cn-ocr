[[File:dungeon_preview2.png|right]]A '''dungeon''', also known as a '''prison''', its rooms known as '''jails'''{{verify|Does jail rooms still exists in game in any manner?}}, is a [[zone]] used by the [[justice]] system within your dwarven community. They are designated from {{menu icon|z}} Zones menu by selecting [[File:Zone dungeon.png|25px]] Dungeon option.

As your dwarves break the law, your [[Sheriff]]/[[Captain of the guard|Captain of the Guard]], or any [[Fortress guard|fortress guard]], will place them in one of the designated restraints, dragging their prisoner to the dungeon regardless of their strength, or even if they transform into a [[werebeast]] halfway there. However, should they be unable to (no dungeon, dungeon is full, or if the crime is terrible enough '''and''' you have a dungeon already...), the [[Hammerer]] will come to give them a severe hammer beating, which will cause quite a [[tantrum spiral|commotion]].

== Dungeon 101 ==
Constructing a dungeon is simple. Build a few restraints, such as metal [[cage]]s, [[chain]]s, and [[rope]]s, then designate them as either a single dungeon or several smaller dungeons.

Unfortunately, being imprisoned tends to make dwarves unhappy... and unhappy dwarves throw [[tantrum]]s, if they don't go outright [[berserk]] or otherwise [[Insanity|insane]]. 

An imprisoned dwarf that seeks an [[Children|infant]] may spam your announcements feed. The child may choose to enter the dungeon and sit exactly one tile away from the grieving mother, just to spite you.

=== Keeping your prisoners secure ===
The first thing to consider is the type of restraint:
* Cages don't permit the dwarf within to move around and make use of the surroundings. A caged dwarf, therefore, is forced to sleep on the bottom of the cage, has to be given [[food]] and [[water]], and can't do anything, besides wait for their prison term to end.
* Chains, on the other hand, allow the dwarf to wander around in the adjacent tiles, potentially giving them access to food, alcohol, and nice furniture to boost [[Thought|happiness]]. However, a dwarf throwing a [[tantrum]] can potentially '''destroy''' its chain and escape to cause further damage to your fortress; furthermore, having justice-designated chains opens the possibility of dwarves being sentenced to [[Hammerer|hammerstrikes]].

You can check how many cages and restraints the game expects you to have inside a dungeon zone in the "Fortress guard" tab of the {{menu icon|j}} [[Justice]] menu.

=== Keeping them happy ===

With the choice of restraint made, now we worry about the surroundings. A chained dwarf, like a chained [[animal]], can move around in a 3×3 square centered on the chain. This allows them to use things in that space and look at items bordering it:
* A [[bed]] gives the dwarf a comfortable place to sleep.
* A small stockpile of good food, such as [[Kitchen|prepared meals]], lets the prisoner eat when they're hungry, instead of when your haulers are free to feed them, and lets you provide high-quality stuff instead of whatever random item the haulers grab.  You won't need barrels for this stockpile, so turn 'em off ([[File:V50 stockpile barrel button.png]] in the stockpile menu).
* Likewise, a small stockpile of [[alcohol]] lets the prisoner drink that, instead of being forced to drink water.  Make it at least two squares, or your haulers will tease prisoners with just an empty barrel.
* And, of course, a [[Throne|chair]] and [[table]] give them a place to eat and drink. Bonus points if you designate a private [[dining room]] and assign it to the prisoner.
* Building all this out of high-[[Item quality|quality]] [[furniture]] will let the prisoner admire it, gaining happiness every time.
* [[Smoothing]] and [[engraving]] the dungeon's surroundings will also give the prisoner something to look at.
* If you enclose the restraint in [[wall]]s with a [[door]], setting the door(s) to internal will let the prisoner admire those too.
* A dwarf can view [[artifacts]] on [[pedestal|pedestals]], so place a few pedestals with artifacts near the chain so the dwarf can view them for [[Need|happy]] art thoughts.
* A dwarf can admire its own restraint, so try a high-quality bone and jewel-encrusted [[steel]] or [[platinum]] chain.
* Adding a [[well]] to each dungeon cell guarantees that your prisoners will never die of thirst, if your <s>free dwarves</s> prison guards are a bit slow restocking their booze. And making the well from high-quality materials allows them to admire it, too!
* Designating a [[temple]] on the dungeon will allow prisoners to pray while incarcerated.

=== Imprisoned Nobles ===
Eventually, save with the greatest of care and micromanagement, one or another of your [[noble]]s will run afoul of the justice system, and be imprisoned.  As with a regular dwarf, this means they will be unable to make use of their regular [[office]]s and other rooms. If it turns out to be your [[bookkeeper]], for example, then you can build a chair within their reach and designate it as their office, and that will let them continue to work. Similarly, an [[expedition leader]] or [[mayor]], if imprisoned by a chain, can hold meetings with your [[liaison]], and if you designate an office for them, might even be happy to do so.

=== Alternatively... ===
You may decide that providing luxurious accommodations, jewel-encrusted chains, and fine dining to criminals, while haulers sleep on the dining room floor, does not meet your standards of dwarven justice. In such circumstances, chaining a dwarf atop a tower exposed to the elements will provide a useful lookout post. Dwarves chained in narrow hallways can also help detect ambushers, while those locked up in your dining hall make for excellent examples to the others. Should you desire to enforce capital punishment from time to time, place your prison chains inside small rooms with doors and a hole in the ceiling accessed by other dwarves. This will allow bucket-by-bucket water torture and drowning executions of any murderers or prisoners with elves in their preferences. Alternately, just lock them in a hideous dungeon to eat rats and drink from mud holes until a giant cave spider comes along and covers them in precious, precious silk.

<!-- Reference: Alexander Dumas' ''The Count of Monte Cristo'' -->

Incidents have been reported where a falsely imprisoned [[human]] had escaped after being taught by an [[Priest|abbot]] to be a [[scholar]] and, soon after finding a [[ruin]] with lots of [[gold]], was appointed as a [[count]] and set out to take [[Intrigue|revenge]] on the [[bookkeeper]] he used to work under and the [[human]] that had him locked up. Interestingly, they were said to be the [[count]] of an [[island]], despite boats not existing. It is theorized that he [[Swimming|swam]] to this island and [[Freezing|waited for the sea to freeze]] before he came back with the treasure. In some versions of the tale, the son of his [[nemesis]] was actually his son.
