'''Jumping spiders''' are a species of [[above ground]] [[vermin]] who may be found in any non-freezing [[biome]]. Unlike most types of spider, they are neither venomous, nor do they produce any [[web]]s (they'll even get caught in the webs of other spiders). Jumping spiders are [[hateable]] vermin, and as such will cause [[Thoughts|unhappy thoughts]] on [[Dwarf|dwarves]] who hold a particular antipathy towards them.

Jumping spiders may be captured by [[trapper]]s and turned into [[pet]]s, but have no pet value at all (essentially giving them a value of zero).

Some dwarves [[Preferences|like]] jumping spiders for their ''striking appearance'' and their ''ability to leap''.
