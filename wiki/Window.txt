[[File:window_preview.png|right]]A '''window''' is an item of [[furniture]] that can be constructed to form solid [[wall]]s surrounding a [[zone|room]]. A window is not considered [[support]] for the purposes of preventing [[cave-in]]s or allowing [[door]]s to be built, but it will block the flow of [[water]]. [[Glass]] windows can be made of any type of glass at a [[glass furnace]], from the same input materials as glass, and are placed similarly to furniture.  Like all furniture, windows must have a floor underneath them to be built.  Alternatively, a [[gem]] window can be directly constructed (on-site, not in a workshop, from three [[jeweler's workshop|cut gems]] of any type (including cut glass and cut [[stone]]{{cite talk|v0.34:Window#"Gem" Windows}}), but can't be made from large gems. If the gems used to make a gem window are of different colors, the window will flash between the different colors of the gems.

[[dwarf|Dwarves]] can get a happy [[thought]] from passing by a window, and an even happier thought if it's built of a material they like.

[[tile attributes|Light]] from a window built into a [[cliff]] face will not illuminate a room and will not prevent [[cave adaptation]].

Note that dwarves can see through windows, and (if civilian) will cancel jobs and run away from hostile creatures standing on the other side of them.  Animals can also see through windows, detecting thieves or ambushes on the other side.

A [[noble]] may [[demand]] a window, no matter how far underground his rooms are. A noble's [[mandate]] to make windows will not be satisfied by building a gem window.

A [[glass]] window's [[value]] multiplier is 25, the same as a [[statue]]. This makes glass windows a good choice for raising the value of a [[zone]]. Gem windows, on the other hand, do not receive value multipliers; a gem window's value is the sum of the value of the gems used in its construction.  For maximizing value, gems are better used for [[decoration|decorations]], even if your [[gem cutter]] and [[gem setter]] are only [[skill|dabbling]].

Both glass windows and gem windows can be wrecked by [[building destroyer]]s. Gem windows will be toppled rather than destroyed, leaving behind the gems they were made from.

Glass windows are used to make [[display case]]s.
