'''Leeches''' are [[hateable]] [[vermin]] who can be found in [[pool]]s and [[lake]]s. They will give [[Thought#Unhappy_Thoughts|unhappy thoughts]] to [[Dwarf|dwarves]] who absolutely detest leeches when they encounter them. [[Giant leech]]es, on the other hand, are likely to give dwarves unhappy ''deaths''. They can't be captured in [[animal trap]]s.

Some dwarves [[Preferences|like]] leeches for their ''feeding habits''.

{{D for Dwarf}}
Little do dwarves know that the humble leech is actually the link between [[elf|elves]] and [[noble]]s. The missing connection is the [[Leech man]], although leech men are closer in the DNA line to nobles than elves.
