:'' If cow cheese is made from cow's milk, what is dwarven cheese made of? ''-- Anon

'''Dwarven milk''' is an [[extract]] obtained from having a [[milker]] milk a [[purring maggot]], and has a value of 2☼. Dwarven milk can be cooked or made into dwarven [[cheese]] (worth 20☼ per unit) by a [[cheese maker]] at a [[farmer's workshop]]. Using dwarven cheese as an ingredient thus creates incredibly valuable prepared meals. Further, some dwarves prefer dwarven milk or cheese and will get a [[Thought#Happy_Thoughts|happy thought]] from it.

Purring maggots are native to the second and third layers of the [[caverns]] and thus are not available from the [[embark|embark screen]].{{Bug|1449}} Currently, only wild purring maggots can be milked; if tamed they become useless for milk production.{{Bug|3670}} [[Modding]] them to inhabit the first cavern layer will make dwarven milk available on embark and in dwarven [[caravan]]s. During world generation purring maggots may be domesticated (it's enough to acquire general familiarity with species) this will make dwarven milk available on embark and in dwarven caravans.
