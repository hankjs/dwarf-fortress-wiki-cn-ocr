'''Guineafowls''' are small [[Domestic animal|domestic]] poultry commonly available to [[Dwarf|dwarven]] civilizations. Male guineafowl are called ''guineacocks'', females ''guineahens''; their chicks are called ''keets''.

Being roughly half the size of a common [[chicken]], guineafowl are at the lower limit of [[butcher]]able creatures. About half of the fully-grown animals will only produce a [[skull]] when slaughtered, no [[meat]], [[fat]] or [[skin]]. Guineafowl are more useful in [[egg production]], where even though the larger, meatier [[turkey]] also produce more [[egg]]s, a guineafowl will reach maturity in a single year, meaning offspring will hit full egg-producing stride at a faster rate. Further, it is easy to embark with both or more types of domestic bird if egg production will be critical to your food supply.

Keep in mind that, like with many domestic animals, you're probably going to have a few arrive as the pets of [[migrants]].  

Some dwarves [[Preferences|like]] guineafowls for their ''social nature''.
