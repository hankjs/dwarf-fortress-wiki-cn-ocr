'''Capuchin men''' are [[animal people]] variants of the common [[capuchin]] who can be found in [[savage]] [[tropical]] [[forest]]s and swamps. They spawn in groups of 5-10 individuals and share their animal counterparts' penchant for [[Thief|thievery]], running off with any [[Steals food|food]] or [[Steals items|items]] they may stumble into. In terms of size, they are a little over half the weight of the average [[dwarf]]. All capuchin men are born with Legendary [[skill]] in [[Climber|climbing]].

Like other savage animal people, they can join [[civilization]]s, become [[historical figure]]s, appear as [[visitor]]s and be playable in [[adventurer mode]].

Some dwarves [[Preferences|like]] capuchin men for their ''social nature'' and their ''intelligence''.
