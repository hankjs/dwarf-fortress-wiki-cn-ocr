'''River otters''' are small [[amphibious]] [[creature]]s found in [[lake]]s, [[river]]s and [[pool]]s, where they appear in groups of 1-4 individuals. While carnivorous, they are benign and will generally not pose a threat to anything. A newborn river otter is called a ''pup''.

River otters can be captured in [[cage]] [[trap]]s and [[Animal trainer|trained]] into cheap exotic [[pet]]s. They give fairly low returns if [[butcher]]ed, serving as an emergency source of [[food]] if needed, but there are far better animals to consider using in a [[meat industry]].

Some dwarves [[Preferences|like]] river otters for their ''playfulness'' and their ''fluffy faces''.
