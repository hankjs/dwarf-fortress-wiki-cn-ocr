'''Giant mosquitos''' are oversized versions of the common [[mosquito]] who can be found in any non-freezing [[savage]] [[biome]], where they spawn one at a time. They are not inherently aggressive but will attack [[Dwarf|dwarves]] who provoke them with bites and wrestling with their wings, which might be dangerous as they're 3 times bigger than dwarves, though their chitin isn't particularly resistant to damage even from peasant punches. As with standard mosquitos, only the females have the ability to suck [[blood]] on a bite. All giant mosquitos possess Legendary [[skill]] in [[Climber|climbing]].

Giant mosquitos may be captured in [[cage]] [[trap]]s and [[Animal trainer|trained]] into [[pet]]s, having the standard value of savage giants. They are born adults and may never be rendered fully tame. They only live one year, making them a bad choice for livestock or [[Zoo|display]], and as such they should be [[butcher]]ed immediately upon training. [[Elf|Elves]] may sometimes sell fully tame mosquitos, and the creatures may also appear as [[mount]]s during an elven [[siege]], where their [[flying|maneuverability]] and numbers may make them a substantial threat.

Some dwarves [[preference|like]] giant mosquitoes for their ''high-pitched buzz'' and their ''ability to feast on blood''.

== History ==
{{d for dwarf}}

Giant mosquitoes may have attempted what was the shortest claim at the throne of [[king of beasts]] for v0.34.01. Not only could they fly, but ''they appeared by the hundreds'' (exactly from 100 to 200 at a time), ensuring a large FPS drop to most forts and just plain being deadly in these numbers.
