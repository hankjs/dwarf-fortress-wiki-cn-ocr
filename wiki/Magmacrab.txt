A '''magma crab''' is a small [[magma]]-dwelling [[creature]] that has the unique ability to [[spit]] globs of liquid [[basalt]] in small quantities. It does so at a very fast rate when at range, but if confronted in close quarters, they can only defend themselves with a weak [[push]] attack. The basalt spit is a very small and incredibly hot glob of the stuff and as such only burns areas it hits, generally melting off the fat of that body part. It should be noted however that this can be exceptionally deadly, especially to smaller [[dwarves]] if they're struck multiple times, as they rapidly bleed until all the fat on the hit parts is melted away. Alternatively, the magma crab's spit may hit some [[cave moss]] and set it alight, causing a cavern-wide [[fire]] which is certainly deadly to dwarves.

Due to having few organs, magma crabs are quite resilient, but due to their small size they can be killed relatively easily by just about any conventional means, from [[cave-in]] [[trap]]s and [[Crossbowman|marksdwarves]] to having a [[mace]]- or [[war hammer|hammerdwarf]] bash it enough times to crush its body. Using militia dwarves can potentially result in fatalities as dwarves are easily hit by the basalt spit, though soldiers with enough skill in [[shield]] use may come out unscathed. Overall, if you leave an open path from their home, magma crabs can be quite disrupting and dangerous, but any potential threat can be neutralized if you wall off any magma access before or after they appear, sealing them in and your dwarves out. Magma crabs cannot be [[butcher]]ed, so the only use of their [[corpse]]s is filling your [[refuse]] [[stockpile]].  Magma crabs crawling out of a volcano onto a glacier will cause ice to melt.

Despite what their name and sprite indicate, magma crabs are not actually [[crab]]-like in terms of body structure; according to their raws, they are essentially crawling heads with a pair of flightless wings, being devoid of extremities like legs or pincers, making them closer to [[hungry head]]s than crabs.

Magma crabs possess a [[pet]] value of 200, but are not [[Animal trainer|trainable]]. Additionally, they can't be spawned in the [[object testing arena]].

Some dwarves like magma crabs for their ''chittering''.
