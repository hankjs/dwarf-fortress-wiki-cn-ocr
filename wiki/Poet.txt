'''Poet''' is a [[performance]] skill used when performing poetic forms, either on their own or as part of a poetic song.

==Adventure mode==
You can improve the poet skill by writing poetry

To write poetry, press {{k|x}}, then select compose, from that menu Poem, and from that menu the poetic form you want to use. This takes several in-game hours, and only advances your skill in the poetic form that you picked.

==Fortress mode==

The effect of poetry in fortress mode is currently unknown.
