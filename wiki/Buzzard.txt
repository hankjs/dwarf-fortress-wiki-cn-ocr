'''Buzzards''' are incredibly weak and extremely annoying [[Creature|animals]] that should be prepared for on [[embark]] to any [[biome]] where they are present. An individual buzzard can steal a stack of [[food]] and they travel in groups of 5-10. They can be particularly devastating for a newly set up fortress which hasn't yet planted a [[farm]]; while the buzzards feast upon prepared warthog kidney, you'll be searching for [[vermin]] to eat.  They also have no qualms about stealing directly from your above-ground farm, biting at your [[farmer]]s, and grabbing strawberries right out from under their noses.

It is possible to capture them in cage [[trap]]s, providing you with a neat bird to release into your zoo. They can be [[Animal trainer|trained]] into [[pet]]s, but generally aren't worth it due to their low pet value. Buzzards will claim and lay [[egg]]s in an available [[nest box]], should you wish to create a swarm of buzzards for your latest project, though they only lay 2 - 3 eggs at a time which is rather poor to [[egg production]] compared to all domesticated poultry. Buzzard eggs, like all eggs, hatch after exactly 3 months.

Buzzards leave very little when butchered. Around half of them will be stripped down to nothing more than a [[skull]] for your [[bone carver]]s.

The creature used in-game is known in real life as the turkey vulture, popularly called buzzard in North America, even though they are not actually related to common buzzards.

Some dwarves like buzzards for their ''striking red face''.
