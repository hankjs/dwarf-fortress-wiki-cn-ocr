'''Cassowary men''' are humanoid versions of the common [[cassowary]] and a [[Creature|species]] of unremarkable [[animal people]], found in [[savage]] [[tropical]] moist broadleaf [[forest]]s. They are exactly the size of [[dwarf|dwarves]] when adults, and spawn in groups of 5-10 individuals, though they are unlikely to pose any danger to your fortress unless provoked.

Like other savage animal people, cassowary men may occasionally join [[civilization]]s, becoming full-fledged citizens who may appear in your fortress as [[visitor]]s or be playable in [[adventurer mode]].

Some dwarves [[Preferences|like]] cassowary men for their ''casques''.
