'''Mahogany''' is a type of [[above ground]] [[tree]]; only found in [[tropical]] [[forest|forests]]. Like the overwhelming majority of overland trees, mahogany [[carpenter|wood]] is brown and produces brown products. Logs can be processed in a [[dyer's shop]] into mahogany [[dye]].

Some [[Dwarf|dwarves]] [[Preferences|like]] mahoganies for their ''loose inflorescences''.
