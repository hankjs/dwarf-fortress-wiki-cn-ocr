{{release notes}}

Dwarf Fortress 50.03 was released as a [[Premium version]] only.

:One more quick release to handle additional stability issues. This version also includes 72 new werebeast tiles, some changes to ambience, and a start to quality of life additions with the ability to select more materials at once when building constructions.

:Small note from Kitfox: if your save was previously corrupting and crashed, it probably cannot be revived, sorry. Many of these crashing errors caused garbage to be inserted into the save, which now is irreparable. If you can reload to an autosave, that's more likely to work. Otherwise, you'll have to start a new fort. Sorry! Thanks!
