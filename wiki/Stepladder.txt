[[File:stepladder_preview.png|thumb|right|Human citizens picking fruit from trees.]]'''Stepladders''' are [[tool]]s used to [[herbalist|harvest]] [[fruit]] from [[tree]]s. If a fruit-bearing tree is located in a [[zone#Plant collection|plant gathering zone]], a dwarf will automatically fetch and place a stepladder under it. Stepladders can be placed anywhere (they don't need to lean on a trunk) and allow a dwarf to grab fruit from up to two z-levels above ground. The dwarf doing the gathering will simply drop the fruit to the ground&mdash;he will not interrupt his work to haul it to a food stockpile. Any passing dwarf, meanwhile, can collect the fruit and haul it away.

Stepladders can be made from [[wood]] by a [[carpenter]] at a [[carpenter's workshop]] or [[metal]] by a [[metalcrafter]] at a [[forge]]. Stepladders can be stored in furniture [[stockpile]]s that have the "other large tools" type enabled, and are managed from the tools section of the [[stocks]] screen. 

== Construction ==
Stepladders are constructed of either wood or metal:

{| border="1" cellpadding="5" cellspacing="0" style="margin:1em 1em 1em 0; background:#F9F9F9; border:1px #AAA solid"
|- style="background: #F9F9F9"
! Material !! Worker !! Workshop
|- style="background: #F2F2F2"
| [[Wood]] (1 log) || [[Carpenter]] || [[Carpenter's workshop]]
|- style="background: #F2F2F2"
| [[Metal]] (2 bars) || [[Metal crafter]] || [[Metalsmith's forge]] or [[Magma forge]]
|}

== Forging and melting ==

* Metal stepladders cost '''two''' [[metal]] bars to forge, or '''six''' [[adamantine]] wafers.
* When a non-adamantine metal stepladder is [[Melt item|melted]] down, it will return '''1.8''' metal bars, for an '''efficiency of 90%'''.
* When an adamantine stepladder is [[Melt item|melted]] down, it will produce '''1.8''' wafers, for an '''efficiency of 30%'''.

== Adventurer Mode ==
These can be constructed from Carpentry and used by standing on the same tile and using the {{k|h}}old key to climb up and down.

== Terminology ==
{{D for dwarf}}
Certain dwarves involved in the [[justice]] system are known to debate with others about whether to call these items "ladders" or "stepladders". Dwarves engaged in these arguments are commonly accused of "making judgements based on narrow-minded cultural assumptions."
