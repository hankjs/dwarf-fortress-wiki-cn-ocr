[[File:ammo_sprites_preview.png|right|The best use for ammo: hurting others. 🏹]]'''Ammunition''' is the collective term for projectiles that can be fired from ranged [[weapon]]s such as crossbows and blowguns. Ammunition is stored in ammunition [[stockpile]]s and carried in [[quiver]]s. Ammunition may also refer to the stones and [[Ballista arrow]] fired from siege engines; for more information about these weapons, see the [[siege engine]] article.

Ammunition for foreign weapons like [[bow]]s and [[blowgun]]s is also considered foreign, and cannot be manufactured in the fortress.
 
All ammunition has "EDGE" [[attack types]]; this means that sharper [[metal]] or other sharp [[material]]s are better for ammunition purposes. As projectiles, however, ammunition is also affected by the density of the material and the volume of the individual arrow, bolt, or dart.

When dwarves with [[bolt]]s or [[arrow]]s stuck in their bodies are treated in a [[hospital]], the removed ammunition will be left in their beds.

==Ammunition table==

There are three types of ammunition in ''Dwarf Fortress'': bolts, arrows, and blowdarts, each fired from a different weapon.

== Effectiveness ==
Projectiles made of different [[material]]s have different levels of effectiveness, depending on the situation. Likely factors in this are the [[weight]] of the ammunition and the [[material science|physical properties of the material]] in combat. The type of ammunition and the weapon used to fire the ammunition may also have an effect on the potential damage possible.

In practice, the material type heavily affects the effectiveness of bolts, just like [[Weapon#Superior_metal_rule|melee weapons]]. Recent dwarven [https://www.reddit.com/r/dwarffortress/comments/11w6lwm/science_the_effectiveness_of_metal_bolts_vs_armor/ !!science!!] has observed that ammo made of equal or lesser metal might take over 4x more ammo to kill the opponent.

Projectiles are more likely to be blocked than parried.{{cite forum|169696/8385967}}

Blowgun darts are noticeably less effective than bolts or arrows, due to them having a light weight and small size compared to other ammo types, almost never managing to pierce armor and being stopped even by clothing, unless the darts are made of metal.

Subterranean animal tribes, the main users of blowguns, do not have access to metal, so you will never see non-wooden blowdarts normally.
==Bugs==
* Marksdwarves may not equip ammunition if the squad they are in was not assigned the default "Archer" uniform when it was created.{{bug|0012008}}
