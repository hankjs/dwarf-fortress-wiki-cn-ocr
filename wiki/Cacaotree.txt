'''Cacao trees''' are [[above ground|aboveground]] [[tree]]s, found only in dry sections of [[biome|tropical rainforests]]. Like the overwhelming majority of overland trees, cacao tree [[carpenter|wood]] is brown and produces brown products. 

While its seeds are the basis of the creation of chocolate in real life, they cannot be used to produce chocolate in-game, even though its trunk is, ironically, chocolate-colored. In real life, cacao fruits are also edible raw.

Some [[Dwarf|dwarves]] [[Preferences|like]] cacao trees for their ''flowers''.
