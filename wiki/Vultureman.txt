'''Vulture men''' are humanoid versions of the common [[vulture]] and a [[Creature|species]] of [[animal people]], found in [[savage]] [[desert]]s and [[tropical]] plains. They are only a little over half the size of an adult [[dwarf]], being unlikely to pose a threat to a civilian's life, though they possess two significant traits: flight and the desire to [[Steals food|steal your food]]. The former makes them difficult to attack, and the latter can be annoying to a newly-embarked fortress which has not yet set up their food industry or made [[Farming|farm plots]].

Like other savage animal people, vulture men may occasionally join [[civilization]]s, becoming full-fledged citizens who may appear in your fortress as [[visitor]]s or be playable in [[adventurer mode]].

Some dwarves [[Preferences|like]] vulture men for their ''patience''.

''A guide to Vulture Man culture and traditions by Kivish Aughra:''
*Vulture Men consider Elves, or '''Elflings''' as they call them, their mortal enemies, and make a point of ceremonially devouring their souls in dark rituals.
*They have been steadfast allies of the Crab Men since the dawn of time, and have been known to employ them as bodyguards and soldiers in their military.
*Have a habit of enslaving any race smaller than they are.
*They are very fond of crystalline gems and minerals, especially Amethysts.
