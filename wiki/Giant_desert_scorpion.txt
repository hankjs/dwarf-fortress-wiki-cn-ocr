<div id="scorps" style="image-rendering:pixelated; -webkit-image-rendering: pixelated; -moz-image-rendering: pixelated; margin-right:10px;">[[File:giant_desert_scorpion_sprite.png|62px|right]]</div>The '''giant desert scorpion''' was a rare, large, aggressive and dangerous [[creature]] found in most [[savage]] [[desert]] [[biome]]s - the above-ground equivalent of the [[giant cave spider]]. As opponents, they were equivalent to [[blind cave ogre]]s in lethality, and could appear in groups of anything from 1-3 mayhem-minded individuals. Giant desert scorpions were predatory, meandering killing machines. They would roam over long distances seeking prey, meaning they ''would'' eventually find your fortress and start stinging [[dwarves]]. Unlike other giant creatures, they never possessed normal and humanoid equivalents. All giant desert scorpions were born with Legendary [[skill]] in [[Climber|climbing]].

The reason they were considered such a big threat was because of their stingers; giant desert scorpions were capable of injecting a [[syndrome|neurotoxin]] which caused necrosis of the brain and nervous system, resulting in instant death once they completely rotted, though suffocation due to respiratory paralysis was likely to occur first. This process took about 950 ticks, or 19 in-game hours. They also [[No Stun|couldn't be stunned]] and [[No Pain|felt no pain]] or fear. A wounded scorpion would never stop fighting until it was dead. This meant that despite its relatively moderate size, the giant desert scorpion was able to one-hit-kill all creatures with [[blood]] and a nervous system, that is, most creatures. Yes, a giant desert scorpion could and would kill an [[elephant]], [[giant]] or [[dragon]] if it got in melee and had the time to sting before getting killed.

They were also famous for their ability to wrest the [[weapon]]s (or [[backpack]]s, or socks, or [[armor]], or whatever item struck their fancy) you or your dwarves wielded out of your hands (thanks to the UPPERBODY_PINCERS possessed by scorpions) and proceed to brutally kill you with them. They had also been reported to shoot [[crossbow]]s in the [[object testing arena]].

Giant desert scorpions could be captured in [[cage]] [[trap]]s and [[Animal trainer|trained]] into pets, being the most valuable animals (tied with giant cave spiders) in the game that weren't [[cave dragon]]s or [[megabeast]]s. Products made from their parts were 4 times more valuable than those made from normal animals, and they gave a decent amount of [[meat]] and [[fat]] when [[butcher]]ed, but most players would lean to the thought of breeding these beasts for the purpose of [[fortress defense]]. Stuffing a cage with thirty scorpions and [[Lever|releasing]] them all at once right next to unsuspecting [[goblin]]s during an invasion was a joyous sight.

Giant desert scorpions were removed from the game in [[DF2014:Release information/0.42.04|version 0.42.04]], with plans for a replacement in a future update.

(Players who can't wait that long can add the old version back in, by [[mod:giant desert scorpion|installing this mod]].)

Some dwarves [[Preferences|liked]] giant desert scorpions for their ''tails''.

{{D for Dwarf}}
It is said that to this day, you can still hear [[dragon]]s complaining about them being removed.
