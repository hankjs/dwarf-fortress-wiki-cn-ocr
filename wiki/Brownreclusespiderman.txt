'''Brown recluse spider men''' are humanoid versions of the common [[brown recluse spider]] and a species of [[animal people]], found in [[savage]] [[temperate]] broadleaf [[forest]]s. They are a little over half the size of an adult [[dwarf]] and appear in groups of 1-3 individuals. Their existence is marked by [[web]]s scattered across the surface, but the creatures themselves are uncommon to encounter.

They do not feel [[No Pain|pain]] or fear, and have three pairs of arms and a moderately [[Syndrome|venomous]] bite that is usually deflected by [[clothes]], but is quite effective at incapacitating animals with pain. Additionally, they cannot disturb or be caught in webs.

Like other savage animal people, brown recluse spider men may occasionally appear in your fortress as visitors, or even join [[civilization]]s, becoming full-fledged [[citizenship|citizens]].

Some dwarves [[Preferences|like]] brown recluse spider men for their ''venomous bite''.

=== Adventure Mode ===
As adventurers, besides the advantages listed above, they have the advantages of no need for sleep, and their 6 arms allow them to equip up to five [[shield]]s and a [[weapon]] if shield-user skill is selected at chargen.  They can actually harvest webs and turn them into [[thread]]; an empty hand must be available to hold the web in order to convert it into thread.

The downsides include a non-standard and rather small body size, meaning most found [[armor]] will not be useful, and strength will be at a penalty. Additionally, brown recluse spider men are completely unable to swim or consume plant food (e.g. berries) due to being carnivorous. 

Due to the way ''Dwarf Fortress'' names things, upon achieving superior base stats, these creatures become ''superbrown'' (e.g. having "superbrown recluse spider man strength").

{{D for Dwarf}}
<!-- Reference: "Spider-Man" Marvel Comics superhero-->
The nature of the animal person creature variation template means that they cannot, in fact, do whatever a spider can.

<!-- Reference: "Drider" Dungeons and Dragons monster -->
It is commonly assumed by uninformed dwarves that brown recluse spider men have the lower half of a spider. This is incorrect and illogical for animal people.
