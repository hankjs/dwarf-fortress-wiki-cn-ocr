'''Glassmaker''' is the skill associated with the glassmaking [[labor]]. Glassmakers make [[glass]] [[furniture]], [[Box|boxes]], [[block]]s, [[trap component]]s, [[gem|raw glass gems]], some [[pipe section|machine component]]s and most [[crafts|craft items]], (all but generic "crafts", which are actually made by a [[gem cutter]]) at a [[glass furnace]] or [[magma glass furnace]].

A glassmaker's [[skill|skill level]] is used to determine the [[Item quality|quality]] of the created good. The type of glass also determines the base value of the final product. 

Glassmakers can produce nearly everything for a fortress as part of the [[glass industry]], and, using a magma glass furnace, can produce green glass indefinitely without consuming anything but dwarven labor and sand.
