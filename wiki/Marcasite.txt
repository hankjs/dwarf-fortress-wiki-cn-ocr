'''Marcasite''' is an unremarkable olive stone found within [[kaolinite]]. While it can be used as building material for [[floor|floors]], [[wall|walls]] and such, it can not be used for [[furnace|furnaces]] and [[forge|forges]].
It is one of a few stones that is guaranteed to produce a boulder when mined, rather than having a 1/4 chance as most do.

In real life, it is similar to [[pyrite]] but is much more brittle and thus not usable as a gem.
