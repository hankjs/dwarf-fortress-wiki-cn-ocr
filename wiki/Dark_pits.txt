'''Dark pits''' ([[File:icon_site_dark_fortress_2.png]]) are the [[goblin]] equivalent to [[hamlet]]s and [[hillock]]s. In ASCII mode, they are marked as {{Raw Tile|º|5:0:0}} on the world map, and ones marked as {{Raw Tile|º|0:0:1}} mean they have been abandoned or [[ruin|ruined]]. 

Much like [[dark fortress]]es, they consist of numerous simple towers criss-crossed by a network of trenches, with most of the population living on the top floor of those towers. Some of these towers also have downward stairs, which lead to the underground part of the site. Generally only one or two of the towers will have these stairs, unlike dark fortresses where most of the towers are linked.

The underground part of the site consists of so-called "pits" (from which the "dark pits" supposedly got their name). These pits come in two variants: "living pits" consisting of corridors and small rooms, and "work pits" consisting of large halls which may contain [[troll]]s, goods and goblin skeletons. Supposedly, the living pits are used as [[bedroom|dwellings]], while the work pits are used as [[industry|industrial]] areas and [[tomb|burial grounds]].
