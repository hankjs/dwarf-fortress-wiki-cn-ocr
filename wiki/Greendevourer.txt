'''Green devourers''' are very rare [[creature]]s who inhabit the second and third layers of the [[cavern]]s. These tentacled monsters, with each tendril ending in a toothy mouth, spawn individually and wander the underground, potentially picking fights with other creatures who provoke them (like passing [[dwarves]]). They are as large as [[human]]s and may deliver some nasty damage to unarmed civilians with their bites, but an armored squad will have very little problem dispatching them.

A dead green devourer can be [[butcher]]ed for a fair amount of returns, except bones, as they, bizarrely, lack those. Products made from their parts are [[Item value|worth]] 3 times more than those made from common domestic animals. Green devourers possess a [[Pet#Pet value|pet value]] of 200, but lack the necessary tokens to be [[Animal trainer|trainable]].

Unlike most creatures, green devourers can't be spawned in the [[object testing arena]].

Some dwarves [[Preferences|like]] green devourers for their ''bizarre appearance''.
