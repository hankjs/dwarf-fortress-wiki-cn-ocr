This error message pauses the game and zooms to the location where the warm or damp stone was located.

[[File:warm_stone_preview.png|right]]Warm or damp stone can be very dangerous, as it indicates the presence of nearby [[magma]] or [[water]], respectively. However, the stone could be warm/damp because the magma/water is beside the tile, directly above the tile, or directly below the tile - and, most of the time, ''you don't know which''. You will only know if you are near the surface and find the damp stone below a known [[murky pool]] or [[river]].

[[File:Damp Stone Butcher.png|thumb|right|In this case, digging the room around the butcher was cancelled due to the last, bottom right tile being below the pool floor. The pool is known since it is on the surface. Note that it was possible to dig below the upper level's damp tiles of clay.]]The safest thing to do is back off several tiles, mine up a [[z-level]] then approach the location again. Rinse and repeat until you emerge above the surface of the magma/water. Note that you will not receive warnings when digging staircases upward. If you plan on digging a staircase to a higher z-level, make sure there are no heavy [[aquifer]]s or [[magma]] in your way!

Only in the middle case would it be unsafe to mine out the square that had just been canceled: In the first and last cases, there would be a floor between your miner and the fluid.

If the damp stone is due to an aquifer, empty tiles next to damp stone will fill with water, either slowly with a light aquifer, or quickly.

The announcements can be changed to add recentering and pausing, either in the [[settings]], or by editing [[announcements.txt]].

If you have [[DFHack]] installed, you will have the option to enable "Damp dig" or "Warm dig" mode. If you do not want to have your digging designations canceled, for example when digging minerals out of a light aquifer, you can enable the appropriate mode when you designate the tiles for digging. Click on the toolbar icon to set your desired mode.

In this screenshot, the upper row is designated without any special mode. The second row is designated with damp dig enabled. The third row is designated with warm dig enabled. The fourth row is designated with both damp and warm dig modes enabled.

In ASCII mode, tiles designated in warm and/or damp dig mode will flash in an appropriate color.

There are also options to retroactively enable damp or warm dig mode for existing designations on a z-level.
