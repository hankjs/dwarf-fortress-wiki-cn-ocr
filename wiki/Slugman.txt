'''Slug men''' are [[animal people]] variants of the common [[slug]], who can inhabit most [[savage]] [[biome]]s. They spawn in groups of 1-3 individuals and are generally content to keep to themselves. In terms of size, they are a little over half the weight of the average [[dwarf]].

Like other savage animal people, slug men can join [[civilization]]s, become [[historical figure]]s, appear as [[visitor]]s and be playable in [[adventurer mode]].

Some dwarves [[Preferences|like]] slug men for their ''slime trails''.

Slug men have been shown to have a preference for spears over other weapons and are highly fascinated by large dwarven computers.
