'''Rest''' is a [[job]] in [[fortress mode]] that is given to [[dwarves]] too badly injured to do anything else. Generally, they lie where they fall until they are rescued and put in a [[bed]]--though they may be able to walk to a bed in a [[hospital]] for certain [[Wound|injuries]], such as badly mangled arms. The injured dwarf will usually remain on the ground or in bed until they are either fully healed, or dead. A dwarf's reaction to a Rest period varies according to [[personality]] -- some will feel contented, others restless.

== Healing ==
The Rest job is the way that dwarves heal injury. If you see a dwarf is resting, it means they are healing naturally. This is different from the [[Unconscious]] status, where the dwarf is simply asleep, or has fainted from pain or injury - Rest is simply recuperating in bed. A dwarf must be resting to heal. If the dwarf is too badly injured to rest and keeps falling unconscious instead, they are likely doomed to a [[fun]] ending.

== Interference with jobs ==
Resting happens randomly; when an injured dwarf that is capable of moving is doing a job, you will see the message "'''Urist Mcinjured cancels X: Resting injury'''" and the dwarf will go to their bed and Rest to heal. This is automatic and cannot be controlled.
