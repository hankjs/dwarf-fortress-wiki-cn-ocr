This is a list of '''Controls''', or '''keyboard shortcuts''', used in the game. Their function can change depending on what game mode you are using and what screen you are at. Menu specific controls are usually listed on the bottom of each screen or next to the respective option when you have opened a menu. Arrows are shown on the edges of the screen if more options are available beyond the screen.  Use the [[#Interface|Interface]] keys to scroll through the list of options.

This document contains a list of the default controls for ''Dwarf Fortress'' as of version v0.50. Controls may be [[Key bindings|customized]] to use a different key sequence through the use of the {{key|}}{{k|↓}}{{k|↓}}{{k|Enter}} menu or by editing the file [[interface.txt]], but this is not recommended for new players.  

For purposes of the game, note that any key designated in uppercase means to hold Shift while tapping that key.  For instance, {{key|V}} means to press {{key|Shift}}+{{key|v}}. Also, pressing a key with Caps Lock turned on will work similar to pressing the key while holding shift. For example, if you want to press {{key|C}} then you could do it by pressing {{key|Shift}}+{{key|c}} or by pressing {{key|Caps Lock}} and then pressing {{key|c}}.

===Camera===
The camera can be controlled both by mouse input or keys. Your view is focused on one [[Z-level|elevation]] at a time. 

{| class=wikitable
| {{key|w}}{{key|a}}{{key|s}}{{key|d}} or [[Image:Mouse-wheelpressed.png|20px|Scroll mouse wheel down.]]
| To move the camera around on the same elevation. Hold shift to double the amount moved.
|-
| {{key|c}}{{key|e}} or [[Image:Mouse-wheeldown.png|20px|Scroll mouse wheel down.]][[Image:Mouse-wheelup.png|20px|Scroll mouse wheel up.]]
| To change camera elevation. Hold {{key|Shift}} to jump 10 levels at a time.  
|-
| {{key|[}}{{key|]}} or {{key|Ctrl}}+[[Image:Mouse-wheeldown.png|20px|Scroll mouse wheel down.]][[Image:Mouse-wheelup.png|20px|Scroll mouse wheel up.]]
| To zoom the camera in and out
|}

: Tutorial note: When your view is in the air above other tiles, you can see them below, but you can only interact with objects in your current elevation. 
: Tutorial note: The view will be dark underground until you begin mining. You can move the camera to the surface with the camera elevation button. The F1 hotkey will recenter on your wagon.
