'''Weaver''' is the [[skill]] associated with the '''weaving''' [[labor]]. Weavers use a [[loom]] to weave [[cloth]] from [[silk]] [[thread]] (from [[web]]s left by [[cave spider]]s, [[giant cave spider]]s, or [[phantom spider]]s), [[plant fiber]] thread (processed from [[rope reed]]s or [[pig tail]]s), or [[yarn]] ([[spinner|spun]] from [[wool]] of [[shearer|shearable]] creatures). Unlike most intermediate goods, cloth has a quality value, and [[dwarf|dwarves]] with high skill in weaving create higher-quality cloth. Collecting spider webs also requires and trains the weaving skill.

Because they visit the [[cavern]]s often to gather webs, weavers are particularly susceptible to encountering dangerous wildlife, such as the giant cave spiders which create the webs they're gathering. Consider assigning physically stronger dwarves for the job and giving them some war [[dog]]s or something similar, so that they have a better chance of fighting off hostile cavern beasts.
