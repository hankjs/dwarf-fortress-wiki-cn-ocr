[[File:blocks_sprite_preview.png|right]]A '''wall''' is either a [[map tile]] or a [[construction]] that blocks access to [[creatures]] and [[Flow|fluids]]; though many creatures can [[Climber#Climbing_safety|climb many walls]]. The appearance of a constructed wall is similar to that of a [[smoothing|smoothed]] natural wall, but it works the same as any filled tile composed of [[stone]], [[clay]] or [[soil]]. Walls either occur naturally (e.g. a Rough-hewn Andesite Wall), or can be constructed. With constructed walls, it is possible to create multi-level [[building]]s such as [[archery tower]]s complete with roofs by creating [[floor]]s on the layer above. A wall fills the tile it is in and creates a walkable space above it.

There is another type of wall known as the '''reinforced wall''', which is much more durable than the standard one, as its purpose is to withstand [[Siege|invaders]]. However, the trade-off is that these type of walls are triply expensive to build, and each tile requires up to two different materials. Each tile of a reinforced wall requires two of a base material, and one unit of metal as the reinforcement. Like standard walls, they can be engraved and have gaps carved into them to assist archers. Normal walls cannot be reinforced later, as those kind of walls need to be removed and replaced with the reinforced version. In ASCII mode, standard and reinforced walls cannot be visually told apart, as the differences in that mode can only be found by hovering the cursor over the walls.

== Digging ==
[[File:two_walls_premium.png|thumb|120px|Normal wall at the bottom, reinforced wall above.]][[File:walls.png|thumb|120px|Walls and pillars.]]As explained on the [[digging]] page, naturally occurring walls can be dug out using the {{Key|d}}igging {{Key|m}}ine command, or channel command {{K|u}}. These tasks are carried out by dwarves with the [[mining]] labor activated.

Natural walls can be designated for s{{K|m}}oothing and en{{K|g}}raving to improve the appearance and value of the wall from the {{K|v}} menu.  These tasks are carried out by dwarves with the [[stonecutter]], [[engraver]] labor respectfully activated.

== Construction ==
Walls can be built ''en masse''. To do this, use the {{K|b}}uild -> Co{{K|n}}struction -> wa{{K|l}}l command. Walls may be built on any square which does not already contain a structure, provided your dwarves can reach an adjacent square (this includes building a wall over empty air next to a floor, allowing for the construction of inverted pyramids). Diagonals cannot be built from, nor will they support constructions.

The important thing to remember is that all walls, floors, or anything built with the {{K|b}}-{{K|n}} keys are LIFO - "Last In, First Out". That means that the very '''last''' designation you make will be the very '''first''' thing your builders will work on next! Once you master this concept, it can be used to your advantage, but only if you can plan ahead.

When building walls across gaps, it helps to take advantage of the fact that walls can be constructed on top of a constructed floor. This is important, since a wall cannot be constructed while standing on top of an adjacent wall tile, as one would extend a constructed floor over empty space by standing on the previously-built tile. To build across a gap, construct a floor exactly where the wall will go, and then build the wall on top of this (but in the reverse direction; see the previous paragraph). Each wall tile constructed this way will therefore require two units of material, which may be recovered on deconstructing the tile. It is possible to cut this requirement in half by constructing a temporary walking surface (sometimes called "scaffolding") next to each planned wall tile, then building the wall over the adjacent open space, then removing the temporary construction, and repeating as necessary, with each iteration widening the wall by one tile until the wall is the desired width. For such multi-tile width walls, it may speed construction to build the next scaffold before removing the previous one.

Constructed walls made from [[stone]]s cannot be smoothed, but can be engraved or carved into [[fortification]]s ({{K|v}}-{{K|f}}ortifications). Unlike constructed fortifications, those created from walls retain an implied [[floor]] on the level above. As usual, the fortifications will block movement, but not [[liquid]]s or small objects such as [[bolt]]s.

Normal walls are considered 'rough'. By using [[stone]], [[glass]], [[wood]], or [[metal]] [[block]]s, higher-quality constructions can be built with increased value.  This can be particularly important when trying to maximize the value of a [[noble]]'s [[zone|room]].

The [[labor]] required to perform the construction can be found under Other Jobs, Wall/Floor Construction.

When building walls, your builders will carry the material to the job site themselves. A useful tip when building [[megaproject|large projects]] is to first make a stockpile nearby, and only allow one type of material in it. After it fills up, build only as many constructions as there are items in the stockpile. Wait for your haulers to refill the stockpile, then build the next section of the project.

When constructing a wall over a walkable tile, the constructing dwarf will move any items in the tile prior to construction. When constructing a wall over an unwalkable tile (such as a tree top) any items stuck in the tile will be destroyed when the construction is completed.

=== Building walls in damp conditions ===
When trying to build walls in damp conditions (such as when digging through an [[aquifer]] in a soil layer), you need to make sure that the area to be built on ''and'' the area the dwarf needs to stand on to build from are at 1/7 or 0/7 when you set the order to build the wall.

If the area the dwarf needs to stand on is 2/7 when the wall is designated to be built, then the dwarf will try to build the wall by standing in the space the wall will occupy, and will never complete the work.

If there are multiple areas, then at least one must be at 1/7, and the dwarf may ignore those which were at 2/7 or greater, even if they subsequently drop to 1/7 or dry out entirely.

== Removing Walls ==
[[File:DFwikiWallRemoved.png|right|]]
To remove a wall, open the {{Key|m}}ining (Previously {{Key|d}}esignation) menu and select {{Key|x}} Remove Construction. This task will be carried out by a dwarf with the [[construction removal]] labor enabled.

== Notes ==
* Walls do not have any effect on [[noise]].
* If a wall that is the only support for a structure is removed, it will [[Cave-in|collapse]], most likely hurting any dwarves on or around it.
* If a tree is near your wall, sometimes dwarves will climb the wall to climb on the tree. If this happens, dwarves could get hurt from falling out of the tree.

== Bugs ==
*Dwarves will once again wall themselves out of the fortress (a regression caused by the fix for the "[[Main:Dwarf cancels construction of Wall: Creature occupying site|Dwarf cancels construction of Wall: Creature occupying site]]" errors). To avoid this behavior, make sure the building material you choose is "inside" the fortress (i.e. closer to your fortress center). Manufactured building materials (like blocks) provide much more control of the location, and consequently the direction the dwarf will approach the build site.
