The '''clean self''' [[job]] is a special job in that it is enabled automatically and cannot be disabled. [[Dwarf|Dwarves]] that have been [[Contaminant|contaminated]], be it by dirt, grime, or [[goblin]] [[blood]], will take a bit of time off at some point to [[clean]] themselves if possible; dwarves that haven't had a bath in a while will do so as well on occasion. They can do this with access to a water source, be it a [[murky pool]], a [[brook]], or a [[well]] (but not [[river]]s as they will be swept away). In the absence of such an area, or if the water source(s) are [[forbid]]den, they will not perform this job.

Cleaning oneself gets rid of anything on the dwarf, and doing so with a bar of [[soap]] in addition to some water has a good chance of providing a happy [[thought]]. It is most useful as preventative medicine: dwarves that clean themselves lower their internal dirtiness levels (even more when they use soap) and thus dramatically lower chances of an [[Health_care#Infection|infection]] in case they are wounded. Many fortresses, especially ones in [[evil]] biomes, include a [[Stupid_dwarf_trick#Bathtub|bathhouse]] in their design. This is important, because a non-military dwarf caught in a rain of repulsive goo will immediately run to clean themselves, usually by dashing in to the various rotting limbs of an undead creature.
