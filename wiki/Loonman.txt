'''Loon men''' are [[animal people]] variants of the common [[loon]], who inhabit [[savage]], [[temperate]] [[lake]]s. They spawn in groups of anywhere between 1-5 individuals and are generally content to keep to themselves. In terms of size, they are a bit over half the weight of the average [[dwarf]]. All loon men are born with Legendary [[skill]] in [[Climber|climbing]].

Like other savage animal people, loon men can join [[civilization]]s, become [[historical figure]]s, appear as [[visitor]]s and be playable in [[adventurer mode]].

Some dwarves [[Preferences|like]] loon men for their ''coloration'' and their ''haunting call''.
