'''Fuel''', '''coal''', and '''refined coal''' are three in-game terms that refer to the same thing, any unit of [[charcoal]] or [[coke]], the two fuels used to power high-temperature industries, namely [[Metalsmithing|metalworking]], [[glassworking]], and [[pottery]].  One unit of either of these fuels is required for every task at a conventional (non-magma) [[smelter]], [[forge]], [[kiln]], or [[glass furnace]].  [[Magma smelter|Magma versions]] of these facilities do not need fuel, and in fact ''cannot'' use conventional fuel to power them, if their magma sources fail.  Fuel is also used as a reactant in the pig iron and steel creation process ''(see [[#Pig iron and steel production|below]])''.

Both "charcoal" and "coke" are considered [[bar]]s; they are found under the "bars" section of the [[stocks|{{k|k}}-stocks]] menu and are stored in Bar/Block [[stockpile]]s.  To place bars of fuel in a stockpile, create a Bars/Blocks stockpile, or a [[Stockpile#Custom_stockpiles|custom stockpile]] with "coal" (found in the "Bars" sub-category) {{k|e}}nabled and {{k|p}}ermitted. To allow ''only'' coal in a stockpile, {{k|e}}nable "Bars/Blocks", {{k|b}}lock everything, and enable "Bars: Other Materials &rarr; Coal" (with {{k|Enter}}). There is currently no way to distinguish between "charcoal" and "coke" when designating stockpiles. But you can sort the coal in stockpiles by origin: if plant-based ones are allowed, there will be charcoal, and if non-plant-based ones are allowed, there will be coal.

== Fuel: charcoal and coke ==
The two types of fuel are '''''charcoal''''' and '''''coke''''' – both are "fuel". These are ''nearly identical'' for in-game purposes, even though they come from different sources and have different in-game names. Whenever you see "fuel", "refined coal" or "coal" in-game, those refer to ''either'' charcoal or coke – they are interchangeable, and either one will serve as fuel for any workshop activity. Since some understandable confusion can arise over the usage of the various terms for fuel, the simple umbrella term "fuel" will be used in the explanations in this article.  

To be perfectly clear – ''despite the different names, there is no distinction between charcoal and coke for any workshop-related activities.'' Both are "refined coal" or "coal", or just "fuel". '''The only actual difference''' between charcoal and coke has to do with [[Elf|Elven]] traders – trading them charcoal will offend them, but coke will not.

== Creating fuel ==
{{main|Fuel industry}}

[[Wood]] does not burn hot enough for use as fuel, and (in ''Dwarf Fortress'') raw [[bituminous coal]] and [[lignite]], though flammable, are not directly usable as fuel. Both can, however, be converted to fuel using different processes:

=== Charcoal, from wood===
Charcoal is created at a [[wood furnace]] from [[wood]] logs by a [[dwarf]] with the [[Wood burner|Wood burning]] [[labor]] enabled. One log produces one bar of charcoal; [[Skill|skill levels]] in [[Wood burner]] reduce the time required for this activity, but do not affect the results.

:* Required Building – [[Wood furnace]]
:* Required Labor enabled – [[Wood burning]]
:* Required Material – [[Wood]]

===Coke, from bituminous coal or lignite===
Coke is a type of refined coal created at a [[smelter]] from either [[bituminous coal]] or [[lignite]] (producing either 9 or 5 coke, respectively) by a [[dwarf]] with the [[Furnace operating]] labor enabled. [[skill|Skill levels]] in [[furnace operator]] reduce the time required for this activity, but do not affect the result.

At a conventional smelter, one bar of fuel is required to perform this reaction, effectively reducing the net yield by one bar.

:*Required Building – [[Smelter]] or [[Magma smelter]]
:*Required Labor enabled – [[Furnace operating]]
:*Required Material – [[Bituminous coal]] or [[lignite]]
:*Required Fuel – one unit of fuel per job at a conventional smelter

[[Block]]s of bituminous coal and lignite (sometimes offered by [[trader]]s) can neither be used as fuel nor converted into fuel in any way. They can only be used for standard block purposes – though they are, of course, ''not'' [[fire-safe]]!

Because you need fuel in order to refine coke at a standard smelter, you may need to create at least one unit of charcoal at a Wood Burner first, [[trade|import]] a bar of fuel, or skip directly to [[#Magma facilities|magma power]].

==Error messages==
At a conventional (non-magma) [[smelter]], if you try to add a smelting task and have no fuel, you will see the message:

<diagram fg="white">
No tasks available
Check for raw material access
and fuel if necessary
</diagram>
:''(Note that this message will also be seen if there is no [[path]] to your workshop or needed materials, including fuel, or if the necessary materials aren't in any linked [[stockpile]]s.)''

You will not be allowed to add any tasks to any conventional smelter until that workshop has access to at least one unit of either charcoal or coke. (However, if you have just one bar of un-used fuel, you can queue up as many jobs as you want – see next.)

If you have queued up multiple tasks and then run out of fuel, you will get an [[announcement]] similar to:

<blockquote>"'''[[Main:Urist|Urist McFuelUser]] cancels job: needs refined coal.'''"</blockquote>

Note that a forge or glass furnace ''will'' let you add tasks if you have no fuel, and only once a dwarf arrives and finds they cannot complete that task will you get the announcement to that effect.  You will get one announcement for each un-fueled task that is unable to be completed. Jobs are canceled when there is no fuel.

When you get either of these messages, you need more fuel – either charcoal or coke will serve equally well.

== Magma facilities ==
Magma replaces conventional fuel for [[magma smelter]]s, [[magma forge]]s, [[magma kiln]]s and [[magma glass furnace]]s.  No fuel is needed, nor can it be used, for activities at these facilities.  Note that you will still need charcoal or coke as a reactant for smelting bars of [[pig iron]] and [[steel]]. (And see next section.)

== Pig iron and steel production ==
When [[smelting]] [[pig iron]] or [[steel]] at any location, one unit of either charcoal or coke is required in the reaction as a source of carbon. Again, there is no distinction – both charcoal and coke serve equally well in the production of [[bar]]s of either. This is in addition to the unit of fuel that is needed to power the furnace at conventional (non-magma) smelters.
