'''Panda men''' are humanoid versions of the common [[panda]] and a [[Creature|species]] of [[animal people]], found in [[savage]] [[temperate]] [[forest]]s. They are nearly twice the size of [[dwarf|dwarves]] when adults and spawn in groups of 5-10 individuals, though they are unlikely to pose any danger to your fortress unless provoked. Unlike their animal cousins, panda men aren't restricted to eating just [[bamboo]], though they'll only appear in areas where bamboo grows.

Like other savage animal people, panda men may occasionally join [[civilization]]s, becoming full-fledged citizens who may appear in your fortress as [[visitor]]s or be playable in [[adventurer mode]].

Some dwarves [[Preferences|like]] panda men for their ''striking coloration'', their ''big fluffy heads and bellies'', and their ''lazy nature''.

<!-- Reference: Kung Fu Panda -->
Panda men should be feared for their legendary kung fu, although even the [[Dragon]] warrior is not much of a match for a competent marksdwarf. They may also be seen joining forces with [[human]]s and [[goblin]]s in wars against lightning-throwing kings and hordes of [[Mantis man|mantis men]]. These panda men often urge others to slow down, since life is to be savored.

<!-- Reference: Panda Cheese commercials / "Never Say No to Panda" meme -->
Panda men also are proud cheesemakers, and refusing to eat their cheese has been known to make them throw a tantrum.
