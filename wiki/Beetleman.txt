'''Beetle men''' are [[animal people]] variants of the common [[beetle]], who can inhabit most [[savage]] [[biome]]s, spawning in groups of 2-5 individuals and are generally content to keep to themselves, but may pick fights if provoked. In terms of size, they are a little over half the weight of the average [[dwarf]]. Like normal beetles, they have a pair of wings, but are unable to fly with them. All beetle men are born with Legendary [[skill]] in [[Climber|climbing]].

Like other savage animal people, beetle men can join [[civilization]]s, become [[historical figure]]s, appear as [[visitor]]s and be playable in [[adventurer mode]].

Some dwarves [[Preferences|like]] beetle men for their ''protective shells''.

{{D for Dwarf}}
If allowed residence in a fortress, Beetle men may form immensely popular rock 'n roll bands. These bands have been known to cause a [[strange mood]] that primarily affects young female dwarves.

Beetle men wearing masks have been seen interacting with [[slug man|slug men]], showing particular aggression towards red-tinted members.

<!-- warning: massive amounts of cope, mald, and seethe incoming -->
Beetle men in groups of five are known to be dirty vile repulsive cheating scumbags who should never be given a happy ending.
