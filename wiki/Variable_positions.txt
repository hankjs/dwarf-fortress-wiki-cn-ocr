= Introduction = 

This page documents the variable positions that entities create when neccesary. This is - in vanilla - the case for [[Human]] and [[Goblin]] [[Civilization|civilizations]], but also for merchant's guilds, mercenary groups, [[Religion|religious groups]] and [[Criminal|criminal]]s.

Initially none of the positions marked as variable do exist for an entity. The positions will only exist for a given entity, if they are either created during world-gen, world-activies(?) or by memory hacking or scripting (ie. with lua). Ie. in vanilla all human civilizations have at the beginning of the world-generation no positions at all, neither on the site nor civ level, as all positions of the vanilla human civs are marked as variable (variable positions: all). When a variable (civ level) position is created, the position is only created for that civilization (entity) and not for any other entities of the same type. Ie. the creation of a law-giver for one human civ does not create law-givers for other human civs.

Also presumably all site-level positions for each entity are created on a per site basis, meaning the creation of a site ruler for one site (of a civ) does not also create the site ruler positions for any other site (of that civ).

The existance of a (variable) position does not mean, that the position will also be filled by a historical figure. But during world-gen the creation of a position will usually be followed-up with the position being filled. Ie. the human historical figure, who forced the creation of a law-giver position, will usually become the first law-giver.

For the succession rules of a variable position (after the position has been initially filled by a historical figure), presumably, the same rules as for non-variable positions apply.

(Disclaimer: The following only applies during world-gen and normal world activities. Scripting and memory hacking can circumvent the normal limitations, but with currently unknown results).

For civ level entities, if the law-giving position is a variable position, the law-giving position does not (seem to) have any further requirements to be created (ie. no other position being already created). Ie. this position can be created by force (or popular support etc.) by any historical figure of that civ. But for all other variable (civ-level) positions the law-giving position must exist as usually the historical figure, who is the law-giver, does create the other variable positions (for various reason).

Something similiar is probably the case for site level positions. Ie. if the ruler of a site is a variable positions, that position needs to be created, before any other site-level variable positions can be created. And the site ruler can afterwards create other variable positions for that site. It is not yet clear if a site level ruling position can be created before a civ level ruling (law-giving) position is created (or exists). This also means that it should be possible, via memory-hacking or scripting, to create (and fill) the variable site level positions (for a player site), at least after the civ level law-giving position has been created (and the law-giving position has been filled), so that a human player site gets the maximum possible human site level positions (with the normal appointment rules for the succession/reappointment of the positions), without having to edit the raw files (as outlined in the human civ page), prior to creating a world, to make the variable positions of human civilizations to "static" ones.

Presumably for guilds (Merchant Guild and other Guilds), mercenary groups, religious orders (and criminals) also a "leader" position needs to be created by a historical figure, before other variable positions for that entity can be created.

= Raw tokens =
The tokens that manage the creation of positions are [[Entity_token#SITE_VARIABLE_POSITIONS|SITE_VARIABLE_POSITIONS]] and [[Entity_token#VARIABLE_POSITIONS|VARIABLE_POSITIONS]]. 

SITE_VARIABLE_POSITIONS allows for the creation of lords, hearthpersons, and [[boss]]es, and [VARIABLE_POSITIONS] allows creation of Law-makers.

= Generated positions =
The following positions can be created. Note: these should be sorted among the different group types.
* CUSTOM_LAW_MAKER
* CUSTOM_LAW_MAKER_2
* CUSTOM_OUTCAST_LT
* CUSTOM_OUTCAST_FACTOR
* CUSTOM_COMPANY_LEADER
* CUSTOM_COMPANY_FACTOR
* CUSTOM_MERCENARY_LEADER
* CUSTOM_MERCENARY_TREASURER
* CUSTOM_BANDIT_LEADER
* CUSTOM_MARKET_OFFICIAL_#
* CUSTOM_OFFICIAL_#
* CUSTOM_MILITARY_STRATEGY
* CUSTOM_MILITARY_GOALS
* HIGHEST_PRIEST
* HIGH_PRIEST
* CUSTOM_GUILD_LEADER
* CUSTOM_GUILD_STEWARD
* CUSTOM_GUILD_CLERK
* CUSTOM_GUILD_ALDERPERSON
* WORSHIP_HF
