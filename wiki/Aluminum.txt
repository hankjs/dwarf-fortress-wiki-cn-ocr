'''Aluminum''' is a high-value decorative metal used to create [[furniture]] and other objects, but not forgable into [[weapon]]ry or [[armor]].

With a [[material value]] of 40, aluminum is tied with [[platinum]] as the second-highest value [[metal]] in the game, after the peerless and extraordinarily rare [[adamantine]]. It also is the second lightest metal, again against [[adamantine]]. Its only [[ore]] is [[native aluminum]] and it is found only exceedingly rarely, appearing only in small [[cluster]]s and only in [[igneous extrusive]] [[stone layer]]s.

==Real world vs. Dwarf Fortress:==
Aluminum is actually the most abundant metal in the Earth's crust, and the third-most abundant element, but in the ''Dwarf Fortress'' world can only be sourced from pure deposits; as aluminum is highly reactive, these are exceedingly rare. This matches the metal's real life account, as until the invention of the [[wikipedia:Hall–Héroult process|Hall–Héroult process]] (which utilizes electrolysis and is thus beyond the technology level of the setting) in 1886/1888 and easy metal extraction from [[bauxite]], aluminum was many times more valuable than gold. 

Napoleon III supposedly gave a banquet where his favored guests were given aluminum utensils, while the others had to make do with ordinary [[gold]]. When the tip of the Washington Monument in Washington DC was forged out of pure aluminum, it was (and remained until the invention of the above process) the largest single object made of metallic aluminum.
