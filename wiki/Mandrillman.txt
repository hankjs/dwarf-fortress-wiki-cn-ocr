'''Mandrill men''' are [[animal people]] variants of the common [[mandrill]] who can be found in [[savage]] [[tropical]] moist broadleaf [[forest]]s. They spawn in groups of 1-5 individuals and share their animal cousins' penchant for [[Thief|thievery]], running off with any [[Steals items|items]] or [[Steals food|food]] they can get their grubby fingers on. In terms of size, they are a little over half the weight of the average [[dwarf]]. All mandrill men are born with Legendary [[skill]] in [[climbing]].

Like other savage animal people, they can join [[civilization]]s, become [[historical figure]]s, appear as [[visitor]]s and be playable in [[adventurer mode]].

Some dwarves [[Preferences|like]] mandrill men for their ''colorful faces''.
