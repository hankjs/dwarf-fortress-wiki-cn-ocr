While the [[alligator snapping turtle]] is named after its ferocity, similarly to an [[alligator]], it is still much smaller than one. This is unlike the '''giant snapping turtle''', a carnivorous beast almost 7 times the size of the average dwarf (slightly larger than an alligator). Giant snapping turtles may be found individually in [[savage]], [[temperate]] [[lake]]s and [[river]]s. 

Like most [[giant animal]]s, giant snapping turtles may be caught using [[cage trap]]s, and butchered to give a fair amount of returns. However, be aware that as they do not have a child stage, offspring of a caught breeding pair won't be possible to domesticate, meaning they will revert to a wild state if their [[animal trainer|training]] is not maintained. Giant snapping turtles lay 5-10 eggs in a clutch. Unsurprisingly, they also give a [[shell]] when butchered, which can be useful for moody dwarves, but no tannable skin, as they have scales.

Giant snapping turtles are exotic [[mount]]s, sometimes arriving in [[elf|elven]] [[siege]]s.

Some dwarves [[Preferences|like]] giant snapping turtles for their ''vicious bites'' and their ''long necks''.
