Searching for a good '''location''' for your fortress is extremely important. If you neglect this, you may find your [[dwarves]] dying off 
from dehydration, starvation or the other dangers that lurk about. Different players consider different sorts of locations to be ideal.  

Players looking for an easy map should look for:

* A location that lacks an [[aquifer]].
* A water source such as a [[brook]], [[river]], or [[lake]], although an aquifer or [[ocean]] can serve in a pinch; most sources also serve as an important source of [[shell]]s
* A [[soil]] layer in which to easily place [[farming|farm]]s, without having to worry about irrigation.
* Absence of [[water|salt water]] on the map, which can make all natural sources of water unpotable.
* Absence of a [[cave]] or similar [[site]], which may contain dangerous native life.
* A [[climate|temperature]] that isn't extremely hot or cold.
* A non-evil, non-savage [[biome]].
* An area with an abundance of [[tree]]s.
* A flat surface.
* An area with [[trade|access]] to [[human]]s and [[elf|elves]].

Players looking to [[maximizing framerate|maximize framerate]] look for:
* An area on a small world.
* An area where their desired features are combined in a small embark area.
* An area without flowing water.
* An area without cyclical [[freezing|freezes]] and thaws.

Players looking for a complete DF experience on a single map generally look for the following features:
* Shallow and deep [[metal]]s to provide ores, especially [[iron]] and [[platinum]].
* A [[flux]] material for making [[steel]].
* A soil layer which acts as a source of [[sand]] to enable a [[glass industry]].
* A soil layer which acts as a source of [[clay]] to enable a [[ceramic industry]], of which [[fire clay]] is especially desirable.
* An area containing a [[volcano]].
* An area with access to [[goblin]]s, and one or more [[necromancer|towers]].

Some other features that are frequently sought out, despite making the game more difficult in many ways, are:
* A [[waterfall]], especially one spanning many z-levels.
* An evil biome, particularly one suffering interesting [[evil weather|weather]] phenomena or one where corpses [[undead|reanimate]].  The borders of such evil areas are especially important to some players.
* An especially small [[island]], such that dwarves may embark on the entirety of the island.
* A small embark location serving as the border of a large number of distinct biomes.
* An area visited by interesting and uncommon creatures, such as [[merperson|merpeople]], [[unicorn]]s, [[giant desert scorpion]]s, or [[sea monster]]s.
* An area with steep, interesting cliffs, or other variations in elevation.
* An area where one or more dwarven civilizations are currently at war with the local humans, elves, or both.
* An area containing an interesting cave, [[night creature|lair]], [[minotaur|labyrinth]], or [[tomb]].
* An area suffering extreme temperature conditions.
* An interestingly glitched area, for instance, one in which [[adamantine|cotton candy]] spirals high above the surface of the map.

It's extraordinarily difficult to find a location that meets all criteria for the "perfect map" for any particular person.  One typically must settle for a map containing certain acceptable elements.

Before you choose a location, remember that all maps have [[magma sea|magma]], and many have [[cavern|underground water]].
