[[File:scribe_icon_preview.png|right]]'''Scribes''' are an assigned [[occupation]] at [[libraries]]. They can be assigned in a library, which can be accessed though Locations submenu in {{menu icon|P}} [[Places]] menu.

Scribes make copies of [[scroll]]s, [[quire]]s, and [[book]]s. To make copies, scribes require [[scroll]]s and [[quire]]s. These can be made of any of the usual crafting materials plus [[paper]] or parchment/vellum at a craftsdwarf workshop.

Without any scribes in your fortress, the books and scrolls written by your residents or visitors will not be copied, increasing the likelihood of theft and reducing access to books for fortress residents.
