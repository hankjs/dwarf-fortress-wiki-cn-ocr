[[File:tropical_preview.png|thumb|300px|right|"A nice place to visit, but I wouldn't want to [[embark]] there."]]'''Tropical''' [[climate]]s are those that are perennially warm. [[Murky pool|Bodies of water]] on the surface may evaporate during dry [[Calendar|seasons]] (usually summer). But they can be refilled by [[Weather|rain]]. Rivers are unaffected. Most tropical climates offer vast varieties of {{Catlink|Animals|animal}}- and {{Catlink|Plants|plant}}life (for example [[Forest#Tropical moist broadleaf forests|moist broadleaf forests]]).
