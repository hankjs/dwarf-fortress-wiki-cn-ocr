'''Custard-apple''' is one of the many genera of [[tree]]s found above ground. Like the vast majority of above ground trees, custard-apple [[wood]] is brown and produces brown products.

Custard-apple wood is fairly lightweight (fifth-lightest, slightly less dense than [[willow]]).

Custard-apple trees bear custard-apples that can be harvested by setting up a gathering [[zone]]. They can be eaten raw, cooked, or brewed into delicious [[alcohol|custard-apple cider]].

Some [[Dwarf|dwarves]] [[Preferences|like]] custard-apple trees for their ''fruit''.
