'''Llamas''' are common domestic livestock available to most civilizations. Llamas can be [[shearer|sheared]] once every 300 days to yield [[wool]], which can be used to make low-value [[cloth]]. In addition to the standard [[meat industry]] products, llamas also supply wool when [[butcher]]ed. 

Female llamas can be milked, and that [[milk]] can then be [[cook]]ed or made into [[cheese]].

As [[grazer]]s, llamas require a moderately-large [[pasture]] to survive; however they still eat significantly less grass than [[cow|cattle]], making them an excellent base animal for the player's combined meat, cheese, and cloth industries.   

Notably, Llamas are the largest and provide the most meat and wool of all the [[shearable]] creatures, though llama wool is equivalent in value to all other wool.

Some dwarves [[preference|like]] llamas for their ''long necks'', their ''jutting teeth'', and their ''wool''.

{{D for Dwarf}}
Instead of Pasture land you may also give your Llamas faces and hands to satisfy their lust for flesh. They seem to also prefer to be pastured next to stockpiles of hats. (more testing needed) 

While llamas are a common choice of livestock, be warned. You never know which one might actually be a [[noble]] transformed by a [[syndrome]]. Said llamas are usually very arrogant and self-centered, and often talk about building a pool upon a hilltop.
