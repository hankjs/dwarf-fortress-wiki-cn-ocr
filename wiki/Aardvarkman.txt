'''Aardvark men''' are the savage [[animal people|half-man/half-beast]] variant of the standard [[aardvark]]. They can be found topside in tropical [[biome]]s, wandering in groups of 1-5. Because of the double 'a', they appear near the top of alphabetized lists, including the create creature list in the [[object testing arena]]. Like their aardvarkian brethren, aardvark people do not actually eat [[vermin]].

Like other savage animal people, aardvark men may occasionally join [[civilization]]s, becoming full-fledged citizens who may appear in your fortress as [[visitor]]s or be playable in [[adventurer mode]].

Some dwarves [[preference|prefer]] aardvark men for their ''long ears'' and ''snout''.

Some Aardvark men are known to wear glasses, and form tight relationships with many other types of humanoid animals, most notably the [[hare man]]. They can often be found in your fortress' library.

Aardvark men appear at the very top of the alphabetical order list for all creature based stockpiles - not really important but it is nice to know.
