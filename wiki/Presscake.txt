[[File:sesame_press_cake.jpg|thumb|290px|right|Press cakes and pomace, like this sesame seed press cake, are generally not edible as-is in real life.]]
A '''press cake''' is a type of [[glob]], a low-value [[food]] item [[screw_press|pressed]] from an [[oil]]-producing [[seed]] or [[fruit|olive]] at a rate of one press cake per unit of oil.  It is a by-product of the pressing process, consisting of the leftover solids from the base material. Unlike most similar byproducts of oil pressing in real life, press cakes are edible. 

Press cakes can be used in the [[kitchen]] when 'prepare meal' tasks are queued, if they are enabled in the Kitchen tab in the {{menu icon|y}} Labor menu. They are stored in a [[Stockpile#Food|food stockpile]] as "pressed material."

To press oil from the various seed crops - all except olives - the seed must first be [[miller|milled]] into paste at a millstone or quern. Only this intermediate product can be pressed. Olives can be pressed directly.
