A '''mountain''' is a [[biome]] with a naturally-high elevation, usually culminating in a peak. [[Volcanic]] activity is most commonly found on mountains.

As part of a starting site, mountains provide jagged terrain and impassable [[cliff]]s. They usually have very limited [[water]] resources, i.e., few ponds or streams, although many streams and [[river]]s originate from the base of mountain ranges.  They often have sparse vegetation, and, depending on the elevation, may lack any sort of usable [[soil]]. In [[adventure mode]] it's impossible to cross a mountain tile while fast-traveling, even if the adventurer(s) have flying capabilities.

It is not possible to start a fortress on an exclusively-mountain biome; however, fortress sites can straddle mountains on one side and more (or less) hospitable biomes on the other, which will provide more valuable diversity of wildlife and resources.

Mountains imply high elevation in the surrounding area.  This can result in a fake "forest biome" that does not actually have any [[tree]]s (''or, a pseudo 'tree line' as it is sometimes called''), since, above a certain elevation (''likely 44 or 45, check your worldgen''), there may be no [[soil]] and, therefore, no place for trees to actually grow.  When choosing a starting fortress site, be sure to check the elevation map (using the {{k|Tab}} key), and try to get a mix of low and medium or high elevations if possible.

Mountains are covered with [[grass]] when first encountered, but if the grass is removed (whether due to grazing, construction, or simple trampling), it will '''never''' grow back{{bug|4164}}. Keep this in mind when designating [[pasture]]s, lest your animals starve.

== Minerals ==

The stratification listed for mountains in ''Dwarf Fortress'' usually consists of one lighter rock type, generally a sedimentary [[stone]] (such as [[limestone]], [[mudstone]] or [[dolomite]]), and then two further layers of heavy intrusive igneous (such as [[granite]] or [[gabbro]]) or metamorphic rock (such as [[gneiss]], [[quartzite]], or [[phyllite]]). Stone, and subsequently [[ore]]s, are always in abundance in mountain [[biome]]s.
