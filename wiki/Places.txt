[[Image:Menu places zones v53.04.png|480px|thumb|right|Example zones tab, displayed after selecting {{Menu icon|P}}]]

The '''place information menu''' is accessed from the main view by clicking the {{Menu icon|P}} menu icon or pressing {{k|Shift}} - {{k|P}}. This allows you to view related information on [[zone]]s, [[location]]s, [[stockpile]]s, [[workshop]]s, [[farm plot]]s and [[siege engine]]s by selecting the corresponding tabs.

This menu has replaced the '''building list screen''' from v0.47 of the game.
