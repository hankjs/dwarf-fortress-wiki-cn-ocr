'''Rat weed''' is an [[Item value|inferior]] [[crop]], on the level of [[muck root|muck roots]] and [[prickle berry|prickle berries]]. It can be [[food|eaten raw]], [[cooking|cooked]] or [[brewing|made]] into [[sewer brew]]. However, it is not as [[Alcohol#List_of_alcohol|delicious]] as any of the [[underground]] crops.

Rat weed is notable in that it has cookable seeds, providing both food and booze in one cheap item (although [[Strawberries|strawberries]] are better if they're also available), and making disposing of their seeds easier if you chose to embark on a biome where farming aboveground crops is impossible.

Some [[dwarves]] [[Preferences|like]] rat weed for its ''hanging leaves''.
