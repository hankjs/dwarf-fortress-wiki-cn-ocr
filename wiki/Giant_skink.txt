'''Giant skinks''' are super-sized versions of the common [[skink]] who inhabit most [[savage]] [[biome]]s. While their original counterparts are just [[vermin]], these [[creature]]s are over 3 times bigger than a [[dwarf]]. They are not particularly aggressive, but are carnivorous and will attack other creatures (including dwarves) who provoke them, potentially killing them. All giant skinks are born with Legendary [[skill]] in [[Climber|climbing]].

Giant skinks can be captured in [[cage]] [[trap]]s and [[Animal trainer|trained]] into [[pet]]s, possessing the standard giant creature pet value. They are born adults, fully-sized right after birth, and cannot be permanently tamed. They produce an adequate amount of products when [[butcher]]ed and lay a fairly high amount of [[egg]]s, making them a good choice for food production - being born fully-sized means they can be butchered immediately after birth for maximum returns, meaning a breeding pair of giant skinks can be a huge help for your [[egg production]] and [[meat industry]]. They are exotic [[mount]]s and may be witnessed being ridden by [[Elf|elves]] during [[siege]]s.

Some dwarves [[Preferences|like]] giant skinks for their ''colorful tongues''.
