'''Giant kestrels''' are simply giant versions of their smaller, more common cousins: [[kestrel]]s. In a similar manner to normal kestrels, they can be captured in a [[cage trap]] and used for [[egg production]]. This makes them better assets for your dwarves alive than dead.

Some dwarves [[Preferences|like]] giant kestrels for their ''coloration'' and their ''hunting prowess''.
