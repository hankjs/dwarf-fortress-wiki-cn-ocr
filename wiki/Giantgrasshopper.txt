'''Giant grasshoppers''' are giant versions of the insect [[grasshopper]]. Compared to most other "giant" creatures, they are unimpressive. Usually benign, if forced into combat they have no [[attack]]s apart from [[push]]ing and [[wrestling]], and unlike their real-world counterparts, they cannot fly or jump. Even with their size maxing out at 200,007 cm<sup>3</sup>, this makes them little threat; consider using them as combat dummies for your military.

Giant grasshoppers cannot be [[animal trainer|tamed]] in fortress mode, as they are born as adults. Tame versions may be obtained from [[elf|elven]] [[caravan]]s or in [[mission|raid]]s on elven sites, but they cannot be trained for [[animal trainer|war]] or [[animal trainer|hunting]]. Like most giant insects, they only have a maximum age of one year, making these rare tame specimens very poor choices as pets anyway. If you happen to acquire one, you may as well just [[butcher]] it.

Some dwarves [[Preferences|like]] giant grasshoppers for their ''chirping'' and ''great leaps''.
