'''Bismuth bronze''' is an alloy of [[copper]], [[tin]] and [[bismuth]], with exactly the same [[weapon]] and [[armor]] properties as regular [[bronze]]. However, it is slightly more valuable (×6 vs ×5) than regular bronze.

==Uses==
Just like regular bronze, it can be used to make weapons and armour, along with all [[furniture]] and other objects.  Bismuth bronze is 20% more [[value|valuable]] than [[bronze]] and three times more [[value|valuable]] than its component parts.

==Obtaining==

Bismuth bronze is made with the following recipe:

* from [[bar]]s (not [[ore]]s): 1 [[Tin]] bar + 2 [[Copper]] bars + 1 [[Bismuth]] bar = 4 Bismuth Bronze bars

Because of these proportions, bismuth bronze is produced in lots of four bars at a time.  While the ores must be smelted normally, only one additional [[fuel]] is needed to produce those four bars of bismuth bronze from the four bars noted above at a regular [[smelter]]. At a [[magma smelter]], fuel isn't an issue, although the additional time and labor of smelting each ore chunk into bars should still be considered.

Bismuth bronze also provides more weapons-grade metal per tin bar than regular bronze, which may be a consideration if [[cassiterite]] is rare on your map.

==Trivia==
In real life, bismuth bronze is often used in applications where ordinary bronze would corrode. Unlike in ''Dwarf Fortress'', real bismuth bronze typically does not contain more than 1-3% bismuth by weight, though in some cases, up to 6% bismuth may be used. Bismuth bronze is very corrosion-resistant, much like gold.
