'''Ogres''' are huge (a fully grown ogre is 100 times the size of an average [[dwarf]], however most ogres you encounter will not be fully grown), violent [[Creature|humanoids]] found in [[evil]] plains. They are highly aggressive, able to [[Building destroyer|destroy buildings]] and strong enough to make short work of [[dog|war dogs]] and inexperienced dwarves. Ogres usually appear in groups of 1-3, which can prove a deadly threat to a new fortress. An attack by ogres in the very beginning will make short work of most unprepared embarkation attempts.

[[Goblin]]s may bring ogres in [[siege]]s in place of [[troll]]s {{cite talk|DF2014 Talk:Ogre}}, and, like trolls, they are fully capable of [[Swimmer|swimming]] (not unlike their [[Blind cave ogre|blind cave]] cousins). It is interesting to note that a clothed ogre is a lot tougher than a troll; if it is wearing good enough [[armor]], it can possibly shrug off masterfully wielded, masterwork [[steel]] [[battle axe]] strikes.

Some dwarves [[Preferences|like]] ogres for their ''low howls''.

Ogres do, in fact, have [[Tissue definition token#Tissue layer tokens|layers]], but as yet, have not been observed travelling with [[Donkey|donkeys]].
==Trivia==
*Previously, the sprites of ogres were less threatening and malformed-looking:
