'''Grizzly bear men''' are [[animal people]] variants of the common [[grizzly bear]] who can be found in [[savage]] [[temperate]] [[forest]]s and [[taiga]]s. They spawn in groups of 2-10 individuals and can be a threat to a fortress, as they are over twice the size of a [[dwarf]] and can easily maul one to pieces with their teeth and claws.

Like other savage animal people, they can join [[civilization]]s, become [[historical figure]]s, appear as [[visitor]]s, and be playable in [[adventurer mode]].

Some dwarves [[Preferences|like]] grizzly bear men for their ''strength''.

==Trivia==
*Currently, grizzly bear men and [[black bear man|black bear men]] share the same sprites in the Premium graphics pack, with the exception that the grizzly man sprites are translated 1 pixel higher than the black bear man sprites (1 pixel to the right instead for the corpse sprites).

Bear men are smarter than the average bear. They are known to raid small food stockpiles.

<!-- Reference: "Banjo-Kazooie" titular characters from game series -->
Bear men have been seen wearing backpacks containing large birds, which some dwarves say are able to lift the bear in flight. Bear men have also been rumored to collect [[Gold|golden]] jigsaw pieces, which in turn hold the power to travel to other lands.
