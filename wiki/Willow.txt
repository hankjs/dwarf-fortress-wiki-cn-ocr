The '''willow''' is a type of [[above ground]] [[tree]] that is found in nearly any [[biome]] that has trees; but only near rivers, pools or other water.  Like the overwhelming majority of overland trees, willow [[wood]] is [[Wood#Types|brown]] and produces brown [[carpenter|products]]. Logs and leaves can be processed in a [[dyer's shop]] into yellow [[dye]].

Willow trees provide the sixth-lightest type of wood in the game, with a [[density]] of 0.390 g/cm³ (just under 2/3 of the average wood density of 0.600 g/cm³). Compared to lighter trees, willows have the benefit of growing nearly everywhere (near water), while the lighter trees are restricted to [[tropical]] climates (in the cases of [[papaya]]s, [[candlenut]]s, [[kapok]]s, and [[custard-apple]]s) or [[Surroundings#Good|good surroundings]] (in the case of [[feather tree]]s). As such, willow is the lightest indigenous wood type available to players on neutral or evil [[temperate]] embarks.

Willow trees produce '''Willow fruit''', which cannot be stockpiled, brewed or cooked at present, leaving dwarves free to chop down these trees for wood, unless they particularly want a shady place to sit while fishing.

Some [[Dwarf|dwarves]] [[Preferences|like]] willows for their ''fluffy catkins'' and their ''sad appearance''.
