'''Hornblende''' is an unremarkable dark gray [[stone]], which can be found in both [[metamorphic]] and igneous [[stone layers]].

==In Real Life==
Hornblende is typically a component of [[igneous layer|igneous rocks]] such as [[granite]], [[basalt]], or [[gabbro]]. It often contains titanium, which the dwarves do not have the technology to refine (no electricity).
Hornblende can be processed into white asbestos. Unfortunately, dwarven [[strand extractor]]s can't do that.
