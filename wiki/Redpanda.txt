'''Red pandas''' are small tree-dwelling [[Creature|mammals]], about the size of a <s>rapidly reproducing malevolent demon</s> [[cat]]. Like [[panda|regular]] and [[gigantic panda]]s, [[trained]] red pandas must consume [[bamboo]] to survive, however their reduced grazer value at least makes survival a possibility when placed in a large [[pasture]]. While they can be [[breeding|bred]] as livestock, their diet and meager [[butcher]]ing returns make them marginally useful, at best. As of 42.06, males are labeled red panda boars and females as red panda sows. 

Some [[dwarves]] [[Preferences|like]] red pandas for their ''large striped tails''.
