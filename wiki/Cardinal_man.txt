'''Cardinal men''' are [[animal people]] variants of the common [[cardinal]], who inhabit a number of [[savage]] [[temperate]] [[biome]]s, spawn in groups of anywhere between 5-10 individuals, and are generally content to keep to themselves. In terms of size, they are little over half the weight of the average [[dwarf]]. All cardinal men are born with Legendary [[skill]] in [[Climber|climbing]].

Like other savage animal people, cardinal men can join [[civilization]]s, become [[historical figure]]s, appear as [[visitor]]s and be playable in [[adventurer mode]].

Some dwarves [[Preferences|like]] cardinal men for their ''coloration''.

{{D for Dwarf}}
Cardinal men, despite popular belief, do not elect [[priest|religious leaders]].

<!-- Reference: Georg Cantor and his discoveries of transfinite numbers -->
Some cardinal men display an obsessive interest in fortress administration and will campaign aggressively for the [[Bookkeeper]] noble position. Such cardinal men are rarely satisfied with the standard "Highest" precision setting, claiming it only accounts for a limited infinity of inventory. They are vocal proponents of [[quantum stockpile]]s and will frequently pause work to lecture the [[Manager]] that a single 1x1 tile containing an infinite stack of ☼masterwork [[koala]] [[prepared meal|roast]]s☼ can easily accommodate a [[caravan]] bringing an infinite number of additional roasts, provided that [[haul]]ers are instructed to shift roasts to a new [[barrel]] number. They claim that even an infinite number of caravans cannot exhaust the [[stockpile]] space, provided that haulers shift roasts in a diagonal fashion. Cardinal men with the [[stonecutter]] labor activated will build [[fortification]]s by recursively adding the middle third of the next block, arguing that the resulting fortification lets in zero [[sun]]light but still provides an infinite number of holes to shoot [[bolt]]s through.

<!-- Reference: Georg Cantor's hated rival Leopold Kronecker -->
Cardinal men are often antagonized by rival [[leopard man|leopard men]] who strictly prefer integer-based accounting. These leopard men will publicly denounce the cardinal man's theories as "[[Elven]] charlatanism", often shouting that "[[Armok]] made the integers, all else is the work of dwarves." Unfortunately, this harassment often interrupts cardinal men during their [[strange mood]]. Unable to locate the [[quire]]s required to complete their transfinite [[book]], and blocked by the leopard man from the [[craftsdwarf's workshop]], the cardinal man will inevitably fail his mood and succumb to [[melancholy]]. They will sadly wander the fortress [[hospital]] zone, refusing to eat or drink, eventually dehydrating to death.
