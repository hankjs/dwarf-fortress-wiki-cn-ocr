''Dwarf Fortress'' v51.03 is a [[Premium]]-only patch that was released January 25, 2025. This fixes an issue that greets players with a deafening screech unexpectedly-loud for their volume settings. The noise activates during unlucky random sound selections involved in clicking scroll buttons and combat with goblins.

This patch modifies these two corrupt-looking ogg vorbis files that are the source of the problem:
*/data/sound/audio/one-shots/goblin-dark-pits/'''one-shot-006.ogg'''
*/data/sound/audio/ui/scrolls/scroll-1/'''scroll-2.ogg'''
