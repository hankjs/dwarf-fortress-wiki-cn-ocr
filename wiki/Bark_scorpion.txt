'''Bark scorpions''' are a species of [[hateable]] [[vermin]] found in [[desert]]s and a number of [[tropical]] [[biome]]s. They may sting [[Dwarf|dwarves]], leading to pain but no long-term consequences. All members of the species possess Legendary [[skill]] in [[Climber|climbing]].

Bark scorpions can be captured by [[trapper]]s and turned into [[pet]]s, but curiously have no pet value (making them be worth 0 dwarfbucks). An [[animal dissector]] can also make a [[vial]] of bark scorpion [[Extract|venom]] with a captured live scorpion.

Some dwarves [[Preferences|like]] bark scorpions for their ''pincers'' and their ''stinging tail''.
