'''Foul blendecs''' are [[fanciful]], intelligent [[creature]]s found in certain [[evil]]-aligned [[forest]]s. Standing as the size of a [[dwarf]], these skull-headed creatures spawn rarely, in groups of 3 to 5 individuals who will menace everything smaller than themselves. They will attack dwarves who provoke them and may cause great injury unless countered by a [[military]] squad. They are a male-only race - no female foul blendecs exist - and are also immortal, only dying to violence and disease.

Foul blendecs are sapient and can open unlocked [[door]]s, though they're unlikely to enter a fortress unless chasing dwarves inside. As described, they're completely eye-less, but can still see through {{token|EXTRAVISION}} (meaning it's impossible to blind them). They possess a [[pet]] value of 250, but lack the necessary tokens to be [[Animal trainer|trainable]] (and even if [[Modding|modded]] to be trainable, the fact they are intelligent creatures will lead to [[Animal trainer#Taming_intelligent_creatures|strange behavior]]). Due to the aforementioned intelligence, dwarves will not [[butcher]], eat or use products made from foul blendecs, limiting their use to occupying space in your [[refuse]] [[stockpile]], [[live training]] or putting them somewhere more to your liking if you capture one in a [[cage]] [[trap]].

Their [[good]] counterparts are the [[satyr]]s.

Some dwarves [[Preferences|like]] foul blendecs for their ''goat heads'', their ''goat legs'' and their ''rotten eye sockets''.

Foul blendecs are quite reminiscent of another [http://darksouls.wikidot.com/capra-demon goat-skull-headed monster]. Dwarves who witness them carrying machetes and using [[dog]]s are recommended to kill the dogs first. 
==Trivia==
*[[File:foul_blendec_sprites.png|right]]Initially, the premium version had a sprite for a child foul blendec. It was later removed from the game, because foul blendecs are adults at birth.
*[[ThreeToe]]'s story [http://www.bay12games.com/dwarves/story/tt_forest_befouled.html "Forest Befouled"] represents a potential origin story for foul blendecs being corrupted from satyrs.
