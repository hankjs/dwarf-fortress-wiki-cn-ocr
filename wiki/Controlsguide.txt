This is a beginner's guide to [[fortress mode|Fortress Mode]] interface [[controls]]. This page assumes the default [[key bindings]].

**You can also assign a room to belong to a specific dwarf here.
* Named [[location]]s designated in your fortress (libraries, temples, guildhalls, taverns)
** In this tab you can control the supplies desired for your locations, as well as designate a worker/workers for the location as appropriate.
* [[Stockpile]]s where you can change what types of objects are stored there, how many [[barrel|barrels]] are used, etc.
