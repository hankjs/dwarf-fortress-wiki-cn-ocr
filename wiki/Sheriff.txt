The '''sheriff''' is the [[noble]] responsible for crude [[Justice|law enforcement]] until your fortress grows large enough to require a [[captain of the guard]], designated through the {{menu icon|n}} [[Nobles screen|nobles screen]]. They will punish lawbreaking dwarves through beatings or imprisonment. Without a [[jail]], jail sentences will be "commuted" to beatings as well.

When appointing a sheriff, note that having a weak dwarf take the position is sometimes a good thing. A sheriff with good strength or training could heavily injure or kill a criminal who might have done nothing worse than push over a [[quern|handmill]] in anger.

When your fortress first elects a [[mayor]] (after reaching 50 dwarves), the sheriff's position will disappear and the sheriff will revert to their normal profession title. A [[captain of the guard]] must be nominated to enforce the law in larger settlements.
