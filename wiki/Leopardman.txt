'''Leopard men''' are [[animal people]] variants of the common [[leopard]] who can be found in [[savage]] [[tropical]] regions and [[desert]]s. They spawn in groups of 1-5 individuals and are generally content to keep to themselves. In terms of size, they are the same weight as the average [[dwarf]].

Like other savage animal people, they can join [[civilization]]s, become [[historical figure]]s, appear as [[visitor]]s and be playable in [[adventurer mode]]. Leopard men are able to wear dwarf-sized [[armor]] and [[clothing]], making it a good choice for adventurers of their species to start in a dwarven civilization.

Some dwarves [[Preferences|like]] leopard men for their ''spotted coats''.
