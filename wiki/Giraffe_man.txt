'''Giraffe men''' are [[animal people]] variants of the common [[giraffe]] who can be found in [[savage]] [[tropical]] [[shrubland]]s and [[savanna]]s. They spawn in groups of 5-10 individuals and generally do not start fights of their own volition. They are almost nine times larger than the average [[dwarf]].

Like other savage animal people, they can join [[civilization]]s, become [[historical figure]]s, appear as [[visitor]]s and be playable in [[adventurer mode]].

Some dwarves [[Preferences|like]] giraffe men for their ''long necks''.
