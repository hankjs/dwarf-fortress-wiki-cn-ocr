'''Lead''' is a heavy, low-value [[metal]] available only from [[galena]] [[ore]]. Unlike in real life, lead is '''not''' a biological toxin.  Lead is not magma-safe or even fire-safe –  it will melt in a grass fire.

== Uses ==
Lead can be forged into [[furniture]] and other objects, like most metals, but its low value and high weight may make it a poor choice for personal objects or anything portable, respectively. However, lead items that are not [[weapon|weapons]] or [[armor]] are just as strong as those of any other metal – a lead [[chain]] or [[bridge]] is exactly as strong as a [[steel]] bridge, even against a [[dragon]] or a [[building destroyer]]. 

Rare [[mood|moods]] might result in a lead weapon or lead armor – and material strength <u>is</u> considered in [[combat]], as well as weapon weight. Lead armor would not be a good result (it's so fragile it can literally be torn apart by a normal [[human|human's]] bare hands), but a lead mace could be very nice.

Lead can also be used to make massive [[minecart]]s to send crashing into [[invader]]s, [[goblin]] or not.  What fun!

If you have a surplus of it, lead can be semi-useful for decorating objects and training [[metal crafter]]s; lead crafts may be traded for a value of 100☼ or more, depending upon [[quality]]. 

Lead can be [[alloy]]ed with [[copper]] and [[tin]] to produce [[lay pewter]].

{{D for Dwarf}}
Since lead poisoning does not (yet) exist in ''Dwarf Fortress'', trading lead [[barrel]]s and [[craft]]s only weighs down the [[caravan]]. This, unfortunately, eliminates the possibility of lead poisoning the elves or humans through trade of lead-based crafts and lead-laced alcohol. However, if your dwarves happen to be irradiated as a result of an [[unfortunate accident]], lead coffins are a safe and practical way to ensure the remains are properly contained.
