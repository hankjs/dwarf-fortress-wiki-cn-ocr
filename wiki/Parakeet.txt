'''Parakeets''' are a species of [[above ground]] [[vermin]], found in a number of [[tropical]] [[biome]]s. They may be captured in [[animal trap]]s and turned into [[pet]]s. All parakeets possess Legendary [[skill]] in [[Climber|climbing]].

Some dwarves [[Preferences|like]] parakeets for their ''coloration'' and their ''ability to speak'' (but they have no actual CAN_SPEAK token).
