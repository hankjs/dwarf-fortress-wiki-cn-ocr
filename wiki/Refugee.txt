'''Refugees''' are groups of people fleeing an invasion, raid, or the destruction of their home [[site]]. They can be encountered in [[adventure mode]] as moving [[army|armies]] setting up [[camp]]-like structures when stopping for the night. These feature cloth or leather tents, and your adventurer may sleep in them as they would in any other house. In fortress mode, refugees may arrive as [[Immigration|migrants]], often with scars and high combat skills that reflect their rough and tumultuous (recent?) past. Since wars and invasions are common after [[world generation]], your [[outpost liaison]] and other foreign [[diplomat]]s will often mention the movement of refugees all across the world map, when meeting with your [[mayor]].

Amusingly, if a refugee is both intelligent and the kind of beast that can attack sites and cause refugees to flee in the first place, they may become a member of a site, and thus become a refugee from ''their own attack''.
