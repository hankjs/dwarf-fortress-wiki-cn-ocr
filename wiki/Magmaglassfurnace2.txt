A '''magma glass furnace''' is a specialized form of [[furnace]] designed for use in the [[glass industry]]. It is functionally identical to a [[glass furnace]], but operates through use of [[magma]] instead of [[fuel]]

==Uses==
Dwarves with the [[glassmaking]] labor enabled can use a magma glass furnace to produce a wide array of objects. Almost all furniture can be made here ([[bed]]s, [[millstone]]s, [[quern]]s, and [[slab]]s are the exceptions), as can [[block]]s, [[trade good]]s, [[gem]]s (in the form of raw glass), and a few items which can ''only'' be made of glass:
*[[Vial]]s - These are necessary for acquiring certain [[extract]]s at a [[farmer's workshop]], and can also be used in place of [[flask]]s or [[waterskin]]s.
*[[Window]]s - These function much like [[gem window]]s, but are also necessary inputs in the production of [[display case]]s.
*[[Instrument]]s - Depending on the specific outcome of your particular world gen, you may be able to produce unique instruments and instrument pieces here. Produced glass instruments will always be made of green glass, but [[caravan]]s may bring clear and crystal glass instruments for trade.

Some glass items are functionally identical to items of different materials, but have different names. A glass [[door]] is called a "[[door|portal]]," a glass [[chest]] is called a "[[box]]," a glass [[pipe section]] is called a "tube," and a glass [[cage]] is called a "terrarium" or "aquarium."

Magma glass furnaces can also be used to issue the "Collect Sand" order. Doing so requires an empty [[bag]], an Item Hauler, and a [[Activity zone|zone]] designated for sand collection. As the "Collect Sand" order will prevent other furnace tasks from being started until the sand is collected, it is often wise to build several additional furnaces, magma or otherwise, to use for the collection of sand. Not all maps will have a source of sand, but sand may be imported in small quantities. [[Caravan]]s can also bring raw glass [[gem]]s for trade, which can be particularly useful for dealing with [[strange mood]]s.

Passing dwarves may admire magma glass furnaces and receive a good [[thought]].

==Inputs==
Producing glass items requires working with raw materials, though the specific materials are determined by the kind of glass you wish to produce. [[Green glass]] goods are simple, requiring only a single [[bag]] of [[sand]] - the color of the sand makes no difference to the finished product. [[Clear glass]] goods are more complicated, requiring a [[bar]] of [[pearlash]] in addition to the sand. [[Crystal glass]] replaces the sand with an uncut [[rock crystal]] [[gem]], while still requiring the bar of pearlash. Rock crystal is not present in most regions, and is very limited on those maps it does generate on, making production of crystal glass goods a rarity.

Unlike traditional glass furnaces, reactions at a magma glass furnace do not consume [[fuel]], but do require the presence of [[magma]]. This magma is not consumed during production of glass goods; a single tile of magma will last forever.

==Construction==
Magma glass furnaces only become available for construction after discovering a source of magma on your map, and can only function when one of its eight border tiles is above a [[channel]] filled with at least 4/7 height of magma. If this supply of magma becomes unavailable, the magma glass furnace will immediately become inoperable, even for such unfueled tasks as collecting sand. Note that you can still easily collect sand with a non-magma glass furnace.

The overall value of the furnace building helps determine the strength of the good thought that your dwarves receive when admiring it. This value is determined by the value of the material used in its construction as well as the quality of the builder's efforts.
