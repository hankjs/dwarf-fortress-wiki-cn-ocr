'''Hornbills''' are small [[Creature|birds]] that may appear in any [[tropical]] [[forest]], where they spawn individually. They are benign and do little but fly around the air, being harmless to a [[dwarf]] and just about anything else. All hornbills are born with Legendary [[skill]] in [[Climber|climbing]].

Hornbills may be captured in [[cage]] [[trap]]s and [[Animal trainer|trained]] into cheap exotic [[pet]]s. With a [[Egg|clutch size]] of 1-4, their minimal [[butcher]]ing return, and poor pet value, these creatures' use is questionable for any fort. They are commonly sold by the [[elf|elven]] caravans, like many other useless creatures. Consider building a [[butcher's shop]] and a [[leather works]] next to your [[trade depot]] where the merchants can watch, and sell the muddy tree squatters a snack and a nice new hat before they leave.

Some dwarves [[Preferences|like]] hornbills for their ''great bills''.
