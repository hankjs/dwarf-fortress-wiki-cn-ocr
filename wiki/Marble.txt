'''Marble''' is the only [[metamorphic]] [[flux]] [[stone]], and as such is very valuable when in a primarily metamorphic biome. It also frequently contains a wide variety of [[gem]]s.

Being a [[calcium carbonate]] stone, marble can be made into [[quicklime]] at a [[kiln]], to make [[parchment]] [[sheet]]s.
