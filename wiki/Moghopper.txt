'''Moghoppers''' are a species of amphibious [[vermin]] found in any [[savage]] area near [[pool]]s during summer, and can be [[fishing|fished]] and [[fish cleaning|cleaned]] for [[food]]. Moghoppers are, notably, the only creatures in the game usable in [[Fish dissector|fish dissecting]]; they can be [[Captured live fish|captured alive]] and have [[mog juice]] extracted from them, which can be used as a [[cook]]ing ingredient.

Some [[Dwarf|dwarves]] [[Preferences|like]] moghoppers for their ''round tummies''.
