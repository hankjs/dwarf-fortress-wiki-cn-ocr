'''Giant hamsters''' are just the giant versions of their vermin counterparts: the [[hamster]]. They are fairly uncommon and may appear in a small group within most savage biomes. They are benign and will not attempt to remove the entrails of [[dwarf|your bearded slaves]] even when attacked, this despite being slightly larger than [[grizzly bear]]s.

They can be caught in cage traps to be turned into pets, live trade goods, meat, bones, and leather. Despite their pet value, their products don't fetch a high price. 
Giant hamsters are capable of [[breeding]], though have a somewhat short lifespan of 3-5 years. There exists no such thing as a giant hamster pup in ''Dwarf Fortress'', as they are born adults. [[Animal_trainer#Taming_children|Giant hamsters can, therefore, never be fully domesticated]].

Being exotic mounts, they sometimes appear in [[elf|elven]] [[siege]]s.

Some dwarves [[Preferences|like]] giant hamsters for their ''puffy cheeks''.
