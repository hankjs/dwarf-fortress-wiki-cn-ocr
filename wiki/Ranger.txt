'''Ranger''' is a category profession for dwarves that work with live animals, both [[creature|creatures]] and [[vermin]]. Rangers [[hunting|hunt]], [[animal training|train]], and [[Animal caretaker|care for]] animals.

An adult [[dwarf]] whose best [[skill]] is in this category and whose total experience within this category is distributed across multiple skills will be known as a Ranger - if the dwarf's experience is mostly concentrated within a single skill, the dwarf will be known for that particular skill instead. Graphically, rangers will often wear dark green tunics with brown underclothing, gloves and shoes.

The ranger skills are:

* [[Animal dissector]]
* [[Animal trainer]]
* [[Trapper]]}}
