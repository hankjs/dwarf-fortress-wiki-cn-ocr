:''Not to be confused with [[giant sloth bear]]s''

'''Giant sloths''' are oversized variants of the common [[sloth]]. Like the other sloth creatures, giant sloths are quite [[gait|slow]]. Because of this, giant sloths are not particularly dangerous, especially when serving as [[mount|mounts]] during a [[siege]]. In this situation they are actually detrimental to the rider, being slower than any [[goblin]] or [[elf]] would be, even if they had both legs taken out from under them.

Giant sloths can be captured, [[animal trainer|tamed]], and bred for [[meat]] or [[pet]]s; though their only notable trait over other [[grazer|non-grazing]] giant creatures is that they are somewhat easier to keep track of. Some dwarves [[preference|prefer]] giant sloths for their "''slow movement''".

==In real life==

Unlike many giant variations in-game, giant sloths are notable for actually having existed in the real world (though currently [[extinct]]). The closest species to a giant sloth was [[wikipedia:Megatherium|Megatherium]] (although other similar species included [[wikipedia:Eremotherium|Eremotherium]], [[wikipedia:Promegatherium|Promegatherium]], and [[wikipedia:Prepotherium|Prepotherium]] [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Megatheriidae]). It was roughly the size of a modern-day [[elephant]], making it one of the largest land mammals of its time period. It lived in South American [[forest|woodlands]] and [[grassland]]s. [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Megatherium#Habitat]

Interestingly, giant sloths in-game aren't as large as some other giant animals (in addition, they are only a measly 40.36 times larger than [[sloth]]s). They do not produce nearly as much food as an [[elephant]], despite their ancestors being nearly the same size.
