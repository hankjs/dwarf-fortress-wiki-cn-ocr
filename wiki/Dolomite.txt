'''Dolomite''' is a medium-[[value]] and economic type of [[sedimentary layer|sedimentary]] [[stone]] that forms entire layers. It is also a [[flux]] stone, meaning it can be used in the production of [[pig iron]] and [[steel]]. Additionally, it is [[magma safe]], with an extremely high melting point of {{ct|16507}}. It is pale pink with [[premium]] graphics or white with [[classic]] graphics.

In fact, dolomite has the highest [[Temperature#Melting point|melting point]] of all common* stones and metals. It is not safe from the scorching {{ct|50000}} heat of [[dragon]] fire, though it will last longer than most minerals.

(* The uncommon exceptions being [[raw adamantine]] ore, [[adamantine]] metal, and, because it cannot be melted, [[slade]].)

Because of its abundance and utility, dolomite is one of the most remarkable non-[[ore]] stones, and is much more useful than many other flux stones.

Dolomite is slightly denser than the average rock, inhibiting [[hauling]]. Because of its status as a flux stone, which are in high demand in [[steel]]-making, [[wheelbarrow]]s are useful for the transport of dolomite.

==In real life==

Dolomite is composed of calcium magnesium carbonate (CaMg(CO<sub>3</sub>)<sub>2</sub>) and is related to [[limestone]], [[chalk]], and [[marble]]. Its ionic and crystalline nature contributes to its high melting point. It's dolomite, baby!

Some [[Iron man|iron men]] have claimed that they are composed of 40% dolomite. However, iron men are known to frequently make illogical, exaggerated and contradictory claims about their composition, especially ones whose internal mechanisms are powered by alcohol. As dolomite is magma-safe, it is sometimes touted by elderly human [[scholar]]s that it "won't cop out when there's heat all about".
