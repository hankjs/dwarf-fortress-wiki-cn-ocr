The '''valley herb''' is a somewhat hard-to-gather [[plant]], for it grows only in [[temperate]] [[grassland]]s in [[Calendar|spring]]. It is edible when [[cook]]ed, but its main use is in producing [[golden salve]]. It has no [[seed]]s (''in an unmodded/vanilla game, specifically - see the mod below''). This plant can be collected by [[plant gathering]]. Unlike most other gathered plants, only a single valley herb will be gathered from a shrub.

[[Elf|Elven]] and [[human]] caravans may offer valley herbs for trade in stacks of 5, assuming their nations have access to the proper biome; this large stack size makes them ideal for processing into golden salve, as a single stack will yield a trade good worth 2,500☼ (plus vial value).

* Extract value: 100
* Seasons: Spring

Some [[dwarves]] [[Preferences|like]] valley herbs for their ''tiny leaves'' and their ''soothing fragrance''.
