'''Rope reeds''' is an [[aboveground]] [[crop]]. It is useful for producing [[textile_industry|cloth]] and [[paper_industry|paper]]. They can also be [[brewer|brewed]] into [[alcohol|river spirits]], an affordably priced drink. You will likely be able to collect by [[plant gathering|gathering plants]] near a [[river]] or [[pool]] if you're in a temperate biome, but it may be easier if in a less hospitable enviroment to [[trading|trade]] for the plants or [[seed|seeds]] from a (non-[[dwarven]]) [[caravan]], especially an [[elf|elven]] one.

To produce rope reed cloth, the plants must be [[plant processing|processed into threads]] at a [[farmer's workshop]]. Processing plants will yield both rope reed [[thread]] and [[seed]]s. Rope reed thread can then be woven into [[cloth]] at a [[loom]]. To produce paper [[sheet]]s, it needs to be mashed into a [[slurry]] with a [[millstone]] or a [[quern]] and then pressed on a [[screw press]].

Some dwarves [[Preferences|like]] rope reeds for their ''precise lines''.
