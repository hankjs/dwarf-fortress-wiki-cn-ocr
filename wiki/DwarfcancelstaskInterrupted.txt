{{DFtext|Dwarf cancels task: Interrupted.}}

This means that a civilian dwarf had line-of-sight to a non-friendly creature; it does not matter whether the creature can actually reach the dwarf. The cause can be anything from a [[horse]] or [[Hoary marmot|marmot]] (basically safe to ignore), a [[kobold]] thief (often harmless, will usually flee), potentially dangerous animals like [[cougar]]s (dispatch military or hunter), to a [[goblin]] ambusher (Oh-oh, bad news) or [[40d:carp|carp]] (which were once lethal).
