'''Ocean sunfish''' are a species of huge [[Creature|fish]] who can be found in [[temperate]] and [[tropical]] [[ocean]]s. At one ton, they're the heaviest species of Osteichthyes fish (fish with skeletons made of [[bone]] rather than cartilage) in real life, but are second to [[sturgeon]]s in ''Dwarf Fortress''. Due to their massive size, they provide a great amount of returns when [[butcher]]ed. As non-[[vermin]] fish, ocean sunfish can't be fished by [[Fisherdwarf|fisherdwarves]], but can be caught with the use of a [[drowning chamber]]. Infant ocean sunfish are called ''ocean sunfish fry''.

Some dwarves [[Preferences|like]] ocean sunfish for their ''size'' and their ''strange fins''.
