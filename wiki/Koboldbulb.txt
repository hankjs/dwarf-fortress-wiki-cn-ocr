The '''kobold bulb''' is an unusual [[plant]] found in [[wetland]]s. Its only use is to make [[gnomeblight]], a [[extract|substance]] [[syndrome|poisonous]] only to [[mountain gnome]]s and [[dark gnome]]s. Unfortunately, it requires significant workarounds to apply it and gnomes are weak in combat anyway, so it is effectively useless other than as a valuable [[Trading|trade good]]. Despite the name, they have no relation to [[kobold]]s, nor does their extract affect them.

Some [[dwarves]] [[Preferences|like]] kobold bulbs for their ''shrouded history''.
