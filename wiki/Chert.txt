'''Chert''' is a [[magma-safe]] but otherwise unremarkable brown [[stone]], found in [[sedimentary layer]]s. 

==In real life==
Chert occurs as [[Vein|oval to irregular nodules]] in [[limestone]], [[chalk]], and [[dolomite]] formations. A specific, high-quality type of chert known as flint is used for stone tools as it chips with sharp edges. The art of sharpening flint to create weapons such as arrows is known as [[knapping]].
