'''Blizzard men''' are a species of intelligent and very rare [[creature]] found in [[evil]]-aligned [[tundra]]s and [[glacier]]s, who spawn one at a time. Weighing more than a [[troll]], these beasts are aggressive and will attack any [[dwarf]] who approaches them with punches, kicks, scratches and bites, and should be disposed of with an equipped [[military]] squad or [[trap]]s. Despite being named in a similar fashion, they do not share many characteristics with [[construct creature]]s like the subterranean [[gabbro man]] or [[fire man]]. Killing a blizzard man in [[adventurer mode]] grants more experience than other normal creatures.

Despite what their description may imply, blizzard men are not made of ice, instead being made of normal flesh. However, a note on their raw files states [[Main:Toady One|Toady One]] plans to make them be made out of ice in a future update. Blizzard men possess the {{token|NO_THOUGHT_CENTER_FOR_MOVEMENT}} token, meaning that their limbs do not need to be connected to a brain in order to function (they do not have brains). Due to the aforementioned intelligence, dwarves will not [[butcher]], eat or use products made from blizzard men, limiting their use to occupying space in your [[refuse]] [[stockpile]], [[live training]] or putting them somewhere of your liking if you capture one in a [[cage]] trap.

Some dwarves [[Preferences|like]] blizzard men for their ''translucent skin'', their ''icicle teeth'', their ''glowing red eyes'' and their ''pointy ears''.

<!--Reference: Game of Thrones-->
It has been posited that the best way to keep blizzard men out of the fortress is with an exceptionally large [[wall]].

<!--Reference: Mega Man 6 boss Blizzard Man-->
Blizzard men are often though to roll into spheres to attack, though this behavior has never been seen before. It is unknown how this idea came to be.
==Trivia==
*[[File:blizzard_men_sprites.png|right]]Initially, the premium version had a graphic for a child blizzard man sprite. It was later removed from the game, because blizzard men are adults at birth.
