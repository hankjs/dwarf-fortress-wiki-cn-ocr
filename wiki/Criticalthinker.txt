[[File:Thomas Waterman Wood - Thinking It Over - 1919.990 - Cleveland Museum of Art.jpg|thumb|250px|right|"How do cats ''never'' care?"]]'''Critical thinker''' is a [[scholar]] skill. It is used by scholars when thinking about history [[topics]]. It seems to be an important skill for [[scholar]]s in general, especially when writing [[book]]s/[[scroll]]s. As dwarves [[Learning|level]] in this skill very slowly, it can be worth assigning dwarves that already have a few levels in it as your [[scholar]]s.
