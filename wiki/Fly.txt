'''Flies''' are a type of [[hateable]] [[above ground]] [[vermin]] found in swarms near [[pool]]s, farms with unpicked [[rot]]ting [[food]] and food [[stockpile]]s. Since [[cat]]s cannot kill flies, the best way to protect against them is to make sure food is not left outside of a container too long. Also, make sure you have enough [[barrel]]s and [[large pot]]s to store your food and someone ready to pick food from [[farm]]s once ready. If there's no food around outside of a container, the flies will go away.

Flies have the dubious distinction of being the only vermin that can cause two separate bad [[thought]]s: "Annoyed by flies", which affects the general populace, and "Accosted by terrible vermin", which affects individual [[dwarves]] who have a particular [[Preferences|antipathy]] toward flies. All flies possess Legendary [[skill]] in [[Climber|climbing]].

Some dwarves, curiously, like flies for their ''ability to annoy''.
