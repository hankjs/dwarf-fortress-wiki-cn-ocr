'''Hippo men''' are [[animal people]] variants of the common [[hippo]] who can be found in [[savage]] [[temperate]] [[lake]]s and [[river]]s. They spawn in groups of 2-10 individuals and should be approached with extreme caution; a hippo man is over 13 times larger than a [[dwarf]] and can make short work of any civilian who provokes them. Do not attempt to fight them without an equipped [[military]] [[squad]].

Like other savage animal people, they can join [[civilization]]s, become [[historical figure]]s, appear as [[visitor]]s and be playable in [[adventurer mode]].

Some dwarves [[Preferences|like]] hippo men for their ''strength''.

<!-- Reference: "King Hippo" opponent from "Punch-Out!!" video game series -->
Despite popular belief, hippo men are not well-trained boxers, and are not the kings of South Pacific islands.

<!-- Reference:D&D "Giff" monster -->
Rumors of hippo men traveling the stars and shooting people with flintlocks are greatly exaggerated.

<!-- Reference: "Moto Moto" from "Madagascar: Escape 2 Africa" movie -->
Hippo men are known to enjoy the company of the largest hippo women in an area. As a result, they are often at odds with [[giraffe|giraffes]].

<!-- Reference: Animaniacs characters, Flavio and Marito -->
Hippo men do not come in other colors (unless they're [[undead]], which would make them indigo). More specifically, male and female hippos that are blue and purple respectively are not normally seen as married couples, let alone seen as in the aforementioned colors.

<!-- Reference: Hungry Hungry Hippos board game -->
Groups of hippo men love to dump barrels of tree fruit into murky pools, form a circle around the fruit, and then compete to see who can consume the most food using nothing but their mouth.
