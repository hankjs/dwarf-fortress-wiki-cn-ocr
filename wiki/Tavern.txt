[[File:tavern_icon_preview.png|right]]A '''tavern''' or '''inn''' is a place where people [[drink]], lodge, socialize, and entertain with each other. They exist in both [[Fortress mode|fortress]] and [[adventure mode]].

==Fortress mode==

[[File:Tavern v0.43.png|thumb|300px|A tavern in adventure mode. ASCII mode.]]
[[File:tavern_v50_preview.png|thumb|300px|A tavern in fortress mode, v50.]]Taverns are establishments where patrons gather to socialize and can partake in alcoholic beverages and meals, while [[tavern keeper]]s and [[performer]]s serve drink and provide entertainment, with the occasional risks of a bar brawl. Taverns can be an integral part of social life for idling citizens, and may cater to long-term residents and [[visitor]]s, becoming a window to the outside world where [[rumor]]s from nearby [[civilization]]s can be shared. [[Long-term resident]]s will seek to rent rooms here.

Also instead of the "no job" activity a dwarf is usually displayed with the "Socialize" activity, if idleing in a tavern, even if no one else is currently in the tavern. In fact dwarves idleing (and not moving) with the "No job" activity directly adjacent to a zone, which is assigned to a tavern, will be displayed with any of the tavern activities, if the tile the dwarf is idleing on is added to the tavern zone. 

=== Tavern Activities ===
[[File:Daily barter by ncorva.jpg|thumb|<small>''Art by ncorva''</small>]]Once a character is in the tavern, they can do the following:

* '''Socialize''': A dwarf (or character) idleing in a tavern will start socializing. If there are at least two characeters in the tavern, the socialize activity might evolve into another activity, like telling each other stories, reciting poetry, sharing music (performing/listen to music) or dances (perform/watch dance). The only requirement for the last two is that you include a moderate amount of empty space (5x5 as a minimum, though some dances apparently require up to a 10x10 empty space) in the tavern's floor plan, which the game recognizes as a "dance floor." Stocking the tavern with a variety of [[instrument]]s will improve the quality of the music, as performers will simply improvise the sound of any missing instruments. Navigating to a socializing fortress citizen in the citizen list (for fortress citizens) and clicking with the mouse on the symbol directly right of the displayed current performed activity (like "perform dance") will allow you to see the details of the story, song, poem or dance being performed (or watched). For visitors' it might be possible to use the "Others" tab instead of the citizen list to view the performance activity of a visitor.{{verify}} 

Also normal social interaction can happen in a tavern, but two characters will only talk to each other, if they are adjacent to each other (including diagonally adjacent), but not all socializing interactions between two adjacent characters will result in both characters interacting with each other (there is some randomness involved), ie. it can happen that two characters, that are adjacent to each other in a tavern zone (with no other character present) for a whole day, will not get a thought that they did interact with the other character.

* '''Rent Rooms''': If you build a [[bedroom]] and assign it to the tavern (select the bedroom with {{k|q}}, then press {{k|l}} to bring up a list of locations to assign it to.), it will now be known as a "rented room" and become available for rent by visitors who were granted [[long-term resident|long-term residency]]. These vistors don't actually pay you anything for use of the room, but will offer their services in exchange for room and board, essentially joining your fort but refusing to accept labors until they petition for citizenship (with military ones never doing so while alive). You can assign multiple bedrooms to a single Tavern.

:'''''Note''''': Because of {{bug|12061}}, [[Long-term resident]]s do not sleep in rented bedrooms.

* '''Share information:''' Citizens and visitors alike can share information with each other, especially when plied with alcohol. This can include [[rumor]]s about the wider world, the location of your artifacts, learning songs and dances of other civilizations, or even a [[report]] on what happened to the squad you sent on a [[mission]] that never returned.

Because [[location]]s help your fort mood and focus and let jobs finish in them, there's little gameplay reason to not ensure your dwarves often visit them by combining them with dining halls, drinking mounds, or even dormitories and barracks. Lavishly decorating your tavern and filling it with [[Stress|mood]]-enhancing items such as [[mist]] generators will greatly boost your fort's happiness, as every dwarf will eventually need to visit the place to eat or drink.   However, should your fortress dwarves be [[Intelligent undead]] and/or just plain incredibly distracted from a tavern need, doing so will bring them to a halt, as they start to {{gametext|Socialize!|5:1}} to try to fill their needs⁎. In such a state, they'll stop doing regular jobs you assign them until satisfied, finding this way more important. This can be stopped by deleting the zone with {{k|i}}-{{k|x}}-{{k|X}}; or by unassigning the location with {{k|q}}-{{k|l}} and pressing {{k|Enter}} on the 'Remove assignment' option,  but they'll have to start over next time.

=== Tavern Setup === 
Taverns are designated [[location]]s in fortress mode. You may designate them from any [[meeting area]] or [[dining room]]. Upon creation, the new tavern will be given a random name and added to the {{k|l}}ocation list, where you can re{{k|n}}ame it.

In the location menu, you can assign dwarves to the [[occupation]]s associated with taverns: [[performer]]s and [[tavern keeper]]s. However, assigned performers do not appear to actually perform more often than unassigned dwarves, and both performers and tavern keepers will serve drinks in mugs to tavern-goers if your tavern has mugs in a [[chest]]* and a drink stockpile. Serving dwarves tend to provide more alcohol than a creature would normally drink, which can lead to issues with [[drunk]]enness and even [[#Bugs|death]], particularly for your non-dwarven long-term residents!

: (* Note that a [[bin]], which can be set in a 1-tile stockpile to hold only mugs, is ''not'' a substitute for a chest in a tavern. Instead, those mugs would be used by your citizens and long-term residents when thirsty. Mugs stored in the tavern's chests are solely for the use of the tavern keeper and performers to serve drinks.)

Although taverns attract foreign visitors by default, you can change the Tavern patron {{k|r}}estrictions in the location menu, and the total number of allowed visitors in [[Settings#Population_and_seed_capacities|settings]] . If you feel that your dwarves would be better off without fraternization with other peoples, you can simply change the tavern's policy on guests to serve locals only on creation, or have visitor cap of 0†. You can also adjust the number of mugs and instruments the tavern will keep on hand from this menu.

: († If visitors already arrived, no new visitors will arrive past this point, but the old ones will leave on their own time.)

Dwarves will eat and drink in taverns if tables and chairs are available. If the tavern was designated from a [[dining room]], then these dwarves may receive a [[thought]] about "dining in a [quality] dining room". If the tavern does not contain a zone designated as a dining room, dwarves will not receive this thought.

===Tavern risks===

==== Alcohol problems ====
Although it may be fun to see your dwarves singing, dancing, and socializing their spare time away, be aware that having a Tavern Keeper or Performer assigned to a tavern in your fort puts tavern-goers there at risk of both [[alcohol#Alcohol poisoning|alcohol poisoning]] and drunken brawls. Drunk creatures are more prone to violence, especially those with [[human|weak]], [[elf|tiny]] [[goblin|livers]]. Although these outbursts usually begin as a simple fist fight between peasants or children, they can escalate quickly; friends and family of combatants will often join in, leading to huge, undesirable melees which may include highly-trained military dwarves. Even if soldiers don't get involved, lucky punches and scratches can deal permanent wounds or even kill. Worst of all, unless you have a massive hospital with multiple doctors, you can find yourself suddenly buried under dozens of lightly injured dwarves, watching their wounds grow fatally infected as they wait for preliminary diagnosis. 

For the overdrinking itself, dwarves will consider alcohol harmless and not a cause to move people to hospitals on its own. For this, including some [[Beekeeping|bee hives]] or [[Trap#Cage_trap|cage traps]] in your tavern can help ensure unconsicious patrons are removed from the dance floor.

However, there is not much you can do to control for fights besides getting your medical industry up and running before opening the tavern doors, or outright not assigning any alcohol, mugs, tavern keepers or performers to your tavern. But hey, if you want, you can simply think of it as an exciting source of hands-on experience for your med team!

==== [[Agent]]s ====
Taverns are your window to the external world, with all the good and bad it has to offer. If you happen to be in possession of a much coveted [[artifact]], foreign [[agent]]s ''will'' eventually venture to your tavern to gather information, assuming your dwarves can't hold their tongues. They will pose as any other [[visitor]], chat with your dwarves and other tavern patrons, potentially trying to [[Villain#Plotting|corrupt them]], before reporting back home. If your fortress is confirmed to hold artifacts that other entities have laid a [[claim]] on, you may attract a lot of [[siege|unwanted attention]]. Should you happen to notice a group of visitors who are asking about one of your artifacts, you can force them to either leave or act on their plan immediately by setting your tavern to allow only Citizens and Long-Term Residents. Doing this after surrounding the group with military dwarves greatly improves your odds of ending the conflict with minimal loss to your fortress, after which you can resume allowing visitors to your fortress.

==== [[Werebeasts]] ====
You know the problem with opening a public tavern? Anyone can come right in and have a good time. And anyone who comes in could very well be a secret werebeast. One moment, everyone is having a fine drink and a good dance. Next thing you know, a Wereskink appears and turns the Tavern's dance party into a bloody rave. Be careful if you make your tavern public, or don't and sit back and watch the [[fun]] play out.

==Adventure mode==
Taverns ([[File:Slab tavern.png]]/ {{Raw Tile|¶|6:6:1}}) can be found in [[fortress]]es, [[forest retreat]]s, [[town]]s, and [[dark fortress]]es. They are listed in the [[structure]]s tab in the [[legends]]. In the fast travel screen, their names will be in yellow with a brown background ({{DFtext|example|6:6:1}}). In towns and forest retreats, taverns are represented with a [[Finished goods#Goblet|mug]] symbol on the map and with a physical [[slab|sign]]. "Tavern trees" are constructed in forest retreats but are considered taverns nonetheless. As their name implies, they are completely made of tree trunks and branches.

You can order drinks and rent rooms at most taverns in exchange for [[coin]]s. To do this, {{Adv menu icon|k}} [[Talking|speak]] to the [[tavern keeper]] and choose to {{DFtext|Ask about available services, drinks, rooms, etc.}} then choose the drink you want to order or the room you want to rent. Drink options are different for each tavern and change every week. Because elven and goblin civs cannot brew drinks, their taverns lack alcohol. Tavern trees additionally do not provide lodging.

You can hold off on paying your debts until you leave the tavern. To pay off your debts, talk to the tavern keeper and choose to {{DFtext|Trade or settle debts}}. You can pay in currency or trade items of equal or greater value than what you owe them in order to pay off your debts. You can ignore your payment and run off if you aren't planning to return any time soon, but you will be labeled as a [[thief]].

===Drinking mound===
In [[hillocks]], a drinking mound can be found, but instead of alcohol, [[drunk|drunken dwarves]] fill up the hollow structure. You can easily recruit them as your companions. Drinking mounds are not considered taverns.

=== Custom taverns ===
The [[Adventurer_mode_gameplay#Woodcutting.2C_building_and_site_management|build menu]] gives you the zoning option to allocate a tavern area. Companions left here will behave as if they are in a tavern - even without a tavern keeper, drinking vessels, furniture or instruments, they will mill about, gossip and [[Performance|perform]].

{{D for Dwarf}}
A little-known idiom about taverns and cats is the ancient dwarven expression, "Oh Urist, curiosity didn't kill the cat, the booze did." This became popularized early on due to cats liking booze just as much, if not more, than dwarves did, which led to a century-long friendship between cat and dwarf kind – and many cats dying of alcohol poisoning in taverns. Many, many cats. Sadly, cats have recently become less inclined to drink booze. Scholars claim this is probably due to the process of [[Bugs|natural selection]].
