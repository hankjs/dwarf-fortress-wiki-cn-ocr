An '''equipment mismatch''' is usually not as bad as it sounds. This most often means that a [[military]] dwarf was on their way to pick up a piece of gear when a more-appropriate or better piece of gear than what they were on their way to collect becomes available.  

For example, a military dwarf assigned to wear metal [[leggings]] is on their way to pick up some copper leggings when your [[armorsmith]] finishes making some steel leggings.  The military dwarf will cancel the collection of the copper leggings with this message, and then move to collect the steel ones instead.  This happens fairly often when your smiths are cranking out a large number of military items and your soldiers hustle about to collect and distribute the higher-quality items.  

This error may also occur with military equipping bugs such as {{Bug|2687}}.
