A '''Jeweler's workshop''' is a [[workshop]] for a [[jeweler]]. A jeweler uses this workshop to make items more valuable.

== Cutting specific gems ==
By default, the "Cut Gem" task will use any rough gem a jeweler can find. This is usually enough, but sometimes you may want only specific types to be cut. There are two easy ways to ensure this. 

The first way is to specify the task details. After the task has been created the gem type can be specified by clicking the magnifying glass icon ([[File:mag_glass_icon.png]], {{Raw Tile|─|7:0:1}}{{Raw Tile|O|3:0:1}} in [[Classic]]) and selecting the rough gem type there. 

The second way is to use a [[stockpile]] accepting only the types of gems you want to cut, and link it up to the Jeweler's Workshop. This is also useful when you want to cut anything ''but'' specific gem types (e.g. [[rock crystal]], which is needed for [[glass|crystal glass]] production, or rough [[diamond]]s, to save them for [[strange mood]]s), by letting the linked stockpile accept everything but the types you want to reserve.

==Notes==
*The name of this workshop will change if your fortress's primary race provides a custom value for the {{token|PROFESSION_NAME|c|JEWELER}} token.
*Gems are always more [[Item_value#Items_without_quality_levels|valuable]] when cut; however some dwarves will demand rough gems during a [[strange mood]], so it is best not to cut all your gems.
*Rough [[rock crystal]]s are used in glassmaking, but not cut rock crystals, so it is best not to cut these.
*When adding a task to cut/encrust gems, the tasks are generally ordered by gem value, from least valuable to most valuable (in reality, they appear in the order in which they are defined in the raw file "inorganic_stone_gem.txt", which is roughly grouped by rarity).
*It's a good idea to let your [[gem setter]] train with low-value gems, cut stone cabochons, or [[glass]] (which can be manufactured) and only encrust with high-value gems after reaching legendary status, as there's a much better chance they will produce a [[Item quality|masterpiece]] which is 2 times as valuable plus 35.
** Be careful when setting up many encrust jobs or putting one on repeat -- this can result in all the work being done to a single item. This happens because if the gem setter enters the shop and finds a correct item already set up (IE: a hauler didn't remove it after the last job completed) he will simply encrust that item rather than waiting for a different one to be hauled in. (However, this behavior can be beneficial if you wish to, for instance, encrust a dining room statue with every gem in your fortress.)
*Cut gems do not have quality, so it is generally unnecessary to train a dwarf in gem cutting.  The value of gem crafts and large gems do have quality levels, but are trade goods which are not used in gem setting. 
*You may also cut normal stones in the jeweler's workshop. These stones will always come out as cabochons, while other gems will come out as cut gems. The difference being that a cabochon is just a cut and polished stone, whereas a gem is a gem. Some rough gems are also always cut as cabochons, this is dependent on the opacity or transparency of the stone.{{verify}}
*While you can increase the value of crafts by cutting valuable stones such as obsidian or various ores (platinum, silver, or gold) into cabochons and then encrusting your crafts with these stones, it is almost always better to smelt the ore and [[stud]] the crafts instead (or just produce more metal crafts). 
*The ability to cut all stones makes training [[gem setter]]s much easier, while also providing a convenient way to dispose of excess stone.  This works even better with [[flux]] stones and [[obsidian]], since they are 2-3 times as valuable as normal stone.
*It's technically possible to cut boulders made of any material into gems. During regular gameplay, this means [[stone]], [[clay]] and [[ice]].
