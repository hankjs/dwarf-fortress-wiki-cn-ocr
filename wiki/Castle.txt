[[File:castle_preview.png|thumb|220px|right|Complete with a far away bird.]]A '''castle''' ([[File:icon_site_castle.png]] / {{Raw Tile|○|7:0:1}}) is a small [[site]] founded by [[human]]s, consisting of a single [[keep]] or [[mead hall]]-like structure surrounded by high, fortified walls with watchtowers. Both the central structure, which all inhabitants dwell in, and walls are made of random stone types. [[Artifact]]s and loot are stored in here as well. There are no underground or other aboveground structures. All castles occupy 3×3 local tiles.

Adventurers can visit castles, but they cannot rest or fast travel within them.
