A '''table''' is a piece of [[furniture]] necessary for [[dwarf|dwarves]] to eat [[food]] in comfort. A table is also needed to define a [[dining room]] and serve as an operating surface in a [[hospital]]. Tables are also a component to build [[traction bench]]es. Dwarves dislike eating at a [[chair]] without a table and can't share their table or chair with others. 

Tables can be made from a wide variety of materials, including [[wood]], [[stone]], [[metal]], and [[glass]].

Dwarves primarily use tables to eat [[food]], avoiding the negative [[thought]] for eating without a proper table. Since dwarves first try to sit down and only then check whether there's a table to put their food on, the proper placement of chairs is more important for proper dining. Tables without an adjacent chair will simply not be used for eating; if two tables are adjacent to a single chair, one will go unused. Chairs without adjacent tables, however, will cause unhappy thoughts whenever dwarves sit on them to eat, and a single table with two adjacent chairs can also lead to unhappy thoughts if two dwarves sit on the chairs: only one can put their food on the table, the other will have to eat from their lap and will complain about crowded tables.

An unassigned [[dining room]] designated from a table will be used by any dwarves without an assigned dining room, resulting in positive [[thought]]s scaled to the [[Zone#Quality_and_value|quality]] of the dining room. Creating a high-value dining room is one of the easiest ways to give your dwarves a happy thought. Note, however, that dwarves with a table (or chair) in their [[quarters]] may opt to eat there instead, so it is generally best to only install tables in your nobles' quarters.

In a [[hospital]] zone, tables are used during [[surgery]] as an operating surface.

Tables are also used as an input, along with [[mechanism]] and [[rope]]s, at the [[Mechanic's workshop]] to make a [[traction bench]].  The quality of each component is not reflected in the quality of the traction bench, and only the material of the table is used as the material for the bench.

Tables can be created from one [[wood]] log at a [[Carpenter's workshop]], one [[stone]] at a [[Mason's workshop]], one bag of [[sand]] at a [[Glass furnace]] or three metal [[bar]]s at a [[Metalsmith's forge]].

A [[noble]] might [[demand]] a [[glass]] table, so they can watch themselves while they are [[eating]].
