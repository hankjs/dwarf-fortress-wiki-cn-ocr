A '''glass furnace''' is a specialized form of [[furnace]] designed for use in the [[glass industry]].

==Uses==
Dwarves with the [[glassmaking]] labor enabled can use a glass furnace to produce a wide array of objects. Almost all furniture can be made here ([[bed]]s, [[millstone]]s, [[quern]]s, and [[slab]]s are the exceptions), as can [[block]]s, [[trade good]]s, [[gem]]s (in the form of raw glass), and a few items which can ''only'' be made of glass:
*[[Vial]]s - These are necessary for acquiring certain [[extract]]s at a [[farmer's workshop]], and can also be used in place of [[flask]]s or [[waterskin]]s.
*[[Window]]s - These function much like [[gem window]]s, but are also necessary inputs in the production of [[display case]]s.
*[[Instrument]]s - Depending on the specific outcome of your particular world gen, you may be able to produce unique instruments and instrument pieces here. Produced glass instruments will always be made of green glass, but [[caravan]]s may bring clear and crystal glass instruments for trade.

Some glass items are functionally identical to items of different materials, but have different names. A glass [[door]] is called a "[[door|portal]]," a glass [[chest]] is called a "[[box]]," a glass [[pipe section]] is called a "tube," and a glass [[cage]] is called a "terrarium" or "aquarium."

Glass furnaces are also needed to issue the "Collect Sand" order. Doing so requires an empty [[bag]], an Item Hauler, and a [[Activity zone|zone]] designated for sand collection. As the "Collect Sand" order will prevent other furnace tasks from being started until the sand is collected, it is often wise to build several additional glass furnaces, [[magma glass furnace|magma]] or otherwise, to use for the collection of sand. Not all maps will have a source of sand, but sand may be imported in small quantities. [[Caravan]]s can also bring raw glass [[gem]]s for trade, which can be particularly useful for dealing with [[strange mood]]s.

Passing dwarves may admire glass furnaces and receive a good [[thought]].{{Verify|is this still true in v50 without architecture?}}

==Inputs==
Producing glass items requires working with raw materials, though the specific materials are determined by the kind of glass you wish to produce. [[Green glass]] goods are simple, requiring only a single [[bag]] of [[sand]] - the color of the sand makes no difference on the finished product. [[Clear glass]] goods are more complicated, requiring a [[bar]] of [[pearlash]] in addition to the sand. [[Crystal glass]] replaces the sand with an uncut [[rock crystal]] [[gem]], while still requiring the bar of pearlash. Rock crystal is not present in most regions, and is very limited on those maps it does generate on, making production of crystal glass goods a rarity.

Additionally, all reactions at a glass furnace consume one unit of [[fuel]].

==Construction==
Glass furnaces can be built from any [[fire-safe]] material. Strangely enough, [[charcoal]] and [[coke]] are valid mason's materials for building a glass furnace, since their ignition point is above the cutoff for fire safety.

The overall value of the glass furnace building helps determine the strength of the good thought dwarves receive when admiring it. This value is determined by both the value of the material used in its construction, as well as the quality of both the architect's and builder's efforts.
