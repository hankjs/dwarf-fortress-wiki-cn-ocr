'''Molemarians''' are relatively uncommon [[creature]]s found in [[caverns]], from the second layer downwards. They spawn in tiny groups of 1-3 and roam the underground, possibly clashing with [[dwarves]] they find in their path. They are able to freely open unforbidden [[door]]s and can theoretically equip [[weapon]]s and [[armor]] due to having the {{token|EQUIPS}} token.

Molemarians possess the anatomy of a [[centaur]], but rather than being half-[[human]] and half-[[horse]], they possess the upper body of a humanoid mole-rat and the lower body of a [[Naked mole dog|giant mole-rat]] - essentially, they are centaur-shaped mole-rats. Like actual naked mole-rats, molemarians are [[No Pain|immune to pain]] and so will not give in to it during combat. Note that, despite having a humanoid mole-rat half, there is no such thing as a mole-rat man in ''Dwarf Fortress''.

Despite their centaurid appearance and their ability to equip items, molemarians are not intelligent creatures and can be freely [[butcher]]ed into [[meat]] by your dwarves. Products made from their parts are worth twice as much as those made out of common animals. Molemarians possess a [[pet]] value of 400, but lack the necessary tokens to be [[Animal trainer|trainable]]. They can't be spawned in the [[object testing arena]].

Some dwarves [[Preferences|like]] molemarians for their ''freakish appearance''.
