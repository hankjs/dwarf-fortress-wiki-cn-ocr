'''Platypuses''' are small, [[amphibious]] and somewhat rare [[creature]]s found inhabiting [[river]]s, where they spawn one at a time. They are benign and smaller than [[cat]]s, making them typically harmless to the average [[dwarf]]. Males of the species possess [[Syndrome|venomous]] spurs on their legs which they can sting enemies with in their kick attacks, leading to swelling and severe pain on the victim, but their benign and timid disposition means they'll rarely, if ever, poison dwarves. A newborn platypus is called a ''baby''.

Platypuses can be captured in [[cage]] [[trap]]s and [[Animal trainer|trained]] into cheap [[pet]]s. Due to their tiny size, they produce few returns when [[butcher]]ed, and they lay fewer [[egg]]s than domestic poultry, making them subpar animals as livestock.

Some dwarves like platypuses for their ''bizarre appearance'', their ''venomous spurs'', their ''flat tails'' and their ''large bills''.

{{D for Dwarf}}
The river [[titan]] Platypus has come! An enormous [[beaver]]. It has a broad [[duck]] beak and it undulates rhythmically. Its [[river otter]]-like hide is patchy. Beware its poisonous sting! 

Some tamed platypuses have been observed sneaking off to missions during the day to fight evil.
