'''Jaguars''' are very rare [[Creature|animals]] found in [[tropical]] and [[desert]] [[biome]]s, where they spawn one at a time. Weighting more than a [[dwarf]], these predators can kill an unarmed [[peasant]] in moments, but generally fall short against a [[squad]] wearing any kind of protection. On top of low frequency rate, no more than 3 jaguars will exist in a single surrounding before they're considered locally [[extinct]]. A newborn jaguar is called a ''cub''.

Jaguars can be captured in [[cage]] [[trap]]s and [[Animal trainer|trained]] into exotic [[pet]]s, and they're also sometimes brought along with [[Elf|elven]] [[caravan]]s. They can receive additional war or hunting training as well, further increasing their strength. Products made from jaguar parts, should you choose to [[butcher]] them, are [[item value|worth]] thrice more than those made from parts of common animals. Jaguars take 3 years to reach adulthood, though they're fully grown by the age of 2.

Some dwarves [[Preferences|like]] jaguars for their ''spotted coats''.
