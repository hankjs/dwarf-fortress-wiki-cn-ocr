This page is specifically about the '''info.txt''' file. A lot of what is here is redundant; it can also be found at the comprehensive [[Mod]] page.

== Directory Structure ==
Mods contain an [[info.txt file]] and either an "objects" folder or a "graphics" folder (or both.) All of the vanilla objects in the game too use this format. Your mod folder should look something like this:

 [[File:Folder-orange.svg|20px|link=]] Mod Name
  ├ [[File:Text-x-generic.svg|20px|link=]] info.txt
  ├ [[File:Text-x-generic.svg|20px|link=]] preview.png
  ├ [[File:Folder.svg|20px|link=]] objects
  └ [[File:Folder.svg|20px|link=]] graphics



== Mod Info ==
{{main|Mod info token}}

Each mod must have a <code>info.txt</code> at the root of your mod folder. It has a few fields defining basic metadata information about the mod and can be edited using any text editor (like notepad++ or Subline Text). 

=== Examples ===

The info.txt is formatted like so:

{{code|
[ID:my_first_mod]
[NUMERIC_VERSION:1]
[DISPLAYED_VERSION:1.0.0]
[EARLIEST_COMPATIBLE_NUMERIC_VERSION:1]
[EARLIEST_COMPATIBLE_DISPLAYED_VERSION:1.0.0]
[AUTHOR:Your Name Here]
[NAME:My First Mod]
[DESCRIPTION:A cool mod I made!]}}

The examples below are largely identical.

''Note that you should remove the last token "STEAM_FILE_ID" as it will be autogenerated.  Remove the [STEAM_FILE_ID:###] tag since that is unique for every mod and generates automatically whenever you upload your mod to the workshop''
