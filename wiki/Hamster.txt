'''Hamsters''' are a species of [[hateable]] [[vermin]] who may be found in any area that isn't [[biome|freezing]]. Like [[rat]]s, they can pose a risk to [[stockpile]]d [[food]], [[bone]]s, and [[shell]]s, and may inspire unhappy [[thought]]s to [[Dwarf|dwarves]] who hold a particular antipathy towards them.

Hamsters may be captured by [[trapper]]s and turned into low-value [[pet]]s. They have the {{token|GNAWER}} tag, so they can escape wooden [[animal trap]]s and [[cage]]s. They will escape from them almost instantly, pausing the game and giving a message, so if you plan on doing any trapping on a map that has them, you should make only [[metal]] animal traps and discard all others.

Hamsters may be kept in a [[cage]] like other [[vermin]]. Multiple hamsters may be kept in a single [[cage]].

Some dwarves [[Preferences|like]] hamsters for their ''puffy cheeks''.

{{D for Dwarf}}
Rumors of miniature giant space hamsters are spreading. Reportedly, they resemble ordinary hamsters but are a distinct sentient race. As of now, it is unknown whether they are a threat, valuable <s>pets</s> allies, or just a rumor.
