[[File:bow_sprite_preview.png|right]]
A '''bow''' is a ranged [[weapon]] that fires [[ammunition|projectiles]] called [[arrow]]s. Compared to [[crossbow]]s, bows are less accurate but can be loaded faster. [[Attributes#Strength|Stronger]] and more skilled bowmen fire arrows at higher velocities.

As ranged weapons, bows use and train the [[bowman]] (bowdwarf) skill; as melee weapons, bows use and train the [[swordsman]] (swordsdwarf) skill, instead. Dwarves cannot [[forge]] bows nor [[arrow]]s, limiting supply to artifacts, and whatever low-[[quality]] specimens can be traded from elven or human [[caravan]]s and scavenged from invaders. Trading with humans is preferred because they have metal arrows. In most cases, your dwarves would be better served with crossbows and bolts instead, as they are native weapons. All dwarves can equip bows. Bows do not have to be made out of [[wood]]. [[Weapon#Material|Like all other weapons]], they can be made out of metal.

==Bugs==
* If a [[squad]] is assigned multiple ammo types, dwarves with "individual choice ranged" may carry the wrong ammo{{bug|1374}}.
