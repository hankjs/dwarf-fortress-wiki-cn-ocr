Dwarves will sometimes make '''friends''', and this gives them a happy thought. The likelihood of two dwarves becoming friends increases, as both spend time [[Social skill|socializing]] instead of working. But be warned, although dwarves get happy thoughts from making friends and talking with them, they will become quite sad if a friend dies. This is a common source of [[tantrum|fun]].

Note that friendship is not reciprocal: A dwarf may be friends with another dwarf who isn't even a passing acquaintance. 

There are several ways of avoiding the dangers of friendship. The first and hardest option is to ensure that no one ever idles. The second is to designate a HUGE [[Activity zone#Meeting Area|meeting area]], so that idlers won't be anywhere near each other. The best way, however, is to provide everyone with a personal [[bedroom]]. When this is combined with the absence of a designated meeting area, idle dwarves will spend their time in their bedrooms, alone. Extra care must be taken with [[soldier]]s in the same squad, for not only do they spend a lot of time together, and thus can easily socialize when they're off-duty, but they also are the most likely to die (especially if they're inexperienced recruits). This often leads to the entire squad becoming depressed over the death of a single soldier; combined with the fact that the soldiers are most likely equipped with armor and weapons, this means that [[tantrum|tantrums]] resulting from a soldier's death can be <s>catastrophic</s> fun.
