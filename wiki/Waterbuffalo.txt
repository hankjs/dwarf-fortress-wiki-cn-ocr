'''Water buffalos''' are the largest of all [[domestic animal]]s, roughly twice the size of a standard [[cow]]. They are a common choice for [[trader]]'s pack animals, and [[dwarven]] settlers may bring one or more water buffalos to pull their [[wagon (embark)|wagons]] on [[embark]]. Wild water buffalos may appear as wandering animals in [[tropical]] [[wetland]] [[biome]]s.

Producing up to four times the [[butcher]]ing returns of an ordinary cow, they can feed 7-14 dwarves for an entire year. Water buffalo cows can also be [[milk]]ed for additional sustenence. However, water buffalos are [[Grazer|grazing]] animals; they require a large [[pasture]] to survive. Because of their voracious appetites, water buffalos are a challenging choice for livestock, and their large size makes them dangerous in an [[overcrowding|overcrowded]] pasture.

Some dwarves [[preference|like]] water buffalos for their ''water wallowing''.

{{D for Dwarf}}
Water buffalos possess exceptional martial capabilities when defending settlements, but these abilities only manifest when they are not being watched.
