'''Rattlesnakes''' are small, solitary, [[Syndrome|venomous]] [[creature]]s found in all non-freezing [[biome]]s. Its venom causes pain, nausea, blisters, swelling, and bruising in the short term, and severe localized necrosis in the long term. While small, they can easily kill [[children]], and as such should be approached with caution or dealt with via ranged weapons like [[crossbow]]s. Like other snakes, they continuously grow through their entire lives, reaching their max size at the age of 20, though some rattlesnakes may die of old age as soon as they reach the age of 10.

Rattlesnakes can be captured in [[cage]] [[trap]]s and [[Animal trainer|trained]] into exotic [[pet]]s. They are born adults and as such can't be fully tamed. While their uses are pretty limited, given their small size and few [[butcher]]ing returns, the idea of disposing of [[goblin]] prisoners via rattlesnake pits does sound quite tempting (if only to watch them slowly succumb to poison). Products made from rattlesnake parts are worth [[Multiply value|twice]] more than those made out of common animals. Unlike most reptiles, they give live birth instead of laying [[egg]]s.

Some dwarves [[Preferences|like]] rattlesnakes for their ''warning rattle''.
