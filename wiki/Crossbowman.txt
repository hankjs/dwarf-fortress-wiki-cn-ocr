[[File:dwarf_crossbow.jpg|thumb|250px|right|Prefers iron bolts.]]'''Crossbowman''' is the [[combat skill]] associated with using [[crossbow]]s in battle. Higher skill levels grant better accuracy and a higher rate of fire. Additionally, they significantly reduce the probability of the enemy dodging. A [[dwarf]] with this skill is given the name of '''marksdwarf'''.

While doing decent general [[Weapon#Weapon statistics|damage]], a [[bolt]] does a fine job at piercing the internal organs of a [[creature]], which can possibly cause organ failure, instant death, [[unconscious]]ness or crippling of any size target. This is of limited use against creatures without internal organs, such as [[Magma man|magma men]], but works well against most other creatures. Occasionally a bolt will get stuck in a target; the only known use for this is that a [[wrestling]] dwarf may grab the bolt and twist it in the [[wound]]. Functionally, [[arrow]]s work by the same laws, but they use the bowman skill instead.

Marksdwarves will usually open fire at a distance of 20 tiles or so from their target, but a bolt may travel 30 or more tiles. Note that a difference in height (z-levels) ''hurts'' range, rather than helping it. A marksdwarf who is forced into melee will use the [[hammerdwarf]] skill to bash enemies with their crossbow. 

[[Immigrant|Immigrating]] marksdwarves bring their own crossbows and a quiver with 30-40 bolts.  Immigrating [[ranger]]s often arrive with marksdwarf skill, but will only bring a crossbow and bolts if they also have [[ambusher]] skill.

==Training==

Increasing the crossbowman skill requires firing upon a target (hitting is not required), with "[[Vulture|live]] [[Buzzard|targets]]" granting much more experience than an [[archery target]]. The difference is huge, on the order of ~67 bolts fired (~7.5 [[experience]]/shot) in practice vs. 17 bolts fired (30 [[experience]]/shot) against live enemies in order to achieve novice rank.

==Notes==

It is believed that marksdwarves won't fire through fortifications unless directly adjacent if their skill is below a certain level. This means that for live training exercises which use 2-width diagonal fortifications (see [[mass pitting]]) unskilled marksdwarves won't fire through the fortifications.

==Bugs==

* Marksdwarves may not grab bolts if there were no bolts available on squad creation. {{bug|0012008}}
