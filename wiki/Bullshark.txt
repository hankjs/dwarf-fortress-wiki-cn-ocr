'''Bull sharks''' are [[Cartilage|cartilaginous]] [[Creature#Aquatic|fish]] that can be found in [[tropical]] [[ocean]]s. At 2.5 times the size of an average [[dwarf]], they are fairly large fish and produce a decent amount of [[meat]] when [[butcher]]ed. As fully-sized creatures, they can't be fished by [[Fisherdwarf|fisherdwarves]], but can be caught with a [[drowning chamber]]. An infant bull shark is called a ''bull shark pup''.

Being cartilaginous, bull sharks won't give [[bone]]s if butchered (though they'll still provide a [[skull]]).

Some dwarves [[Preferences|like]] bull sharks for their ''aggressive nature''.
