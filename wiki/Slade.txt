'''Slade''' is the stone that makes up the surrounding layers of [[Hell|eerie cavern]]s. After dwarves dig deep enough down into [[adamantine]] veins, large, demonic caverns made of slade will open up and spew forth demons. [[Underworld spire]]s and [[vault]]s are also made entirely of slade. 

Slade is '''very''', '''''very''''' heavy{{verify}} – according to the density specified in the raws (200 grams per cubic centimeter, 33% higher than the density of the core of the sun!), a single boulder weighs around '''20 metric tons'''; by comparison, an equivalent volume of freshly mined [[native platinum|platinum nuggets]] only weighs around 2.1 metric tons (and takes a ''very'' long time to haul) - this makes slade around ''9.348 times as dense as platinum'', and thus the heaviest material in the game.

It is not possible to mine through slade walls. You can still [[obsidian]]-cast them and then mine that, but this will not yield any slade boulders.

It is possible to use weapons made out of this extremely dense material in Arena mode – tests show that weapons and armor made out of this superdense rock are at least comparable to, if not stronger than even adamantine. In fortress mode, it is possible to obtain slade bars by embarking on a [[vault]] and deconstructing the vertical [[bars]] within. Through a [[strange mood]] slade weapons can be created.

Slade has a natural immunity to [[dragonfire]] since it does not have a specific heat or any state change temperatures defined in the raws.

It may be interesting to note that our friends at Wikipedia also believe [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slade] Slade to be a hard rock and a heavy metal.

==Bugs==
* Although slade is not intended to be diggable, it can be channeled through floors from above, leaving the wall underneath it.{{bug|708}}
* Jewelers may randomly try to cut slade, despite not finding any of it on the map.
