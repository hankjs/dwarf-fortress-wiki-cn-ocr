'''Calcareous ooze''' is one of the several types of [[soil]] that can be found on the floors of deep [[ocean]]s. Not surprisingly, such layers occasionally contain an [[aquifer]].

Calcareous ooze is a type of [[soil|pelagic sediment]]. It is formed by particles of [[flux|calcium carbonate]], as opposed to [[siliceous ooze]], which is formed by the silica in diatoms and other microorganisms.
