[[File:gizzard_sprite_preview.png|right]]A '''gizzard''' is the stomach found in many birds, such as the [[albatross]]. When butchered, it becomes a "prepared &lt;[[creature]]&gt; gizzard", which is an edible organ that can be eaten exactly like [[meat]] or other bodily organs. They have similar size to many other bodily organs, such as the [[brain]] or the [[liver]].

Some creatures with gizzards also provide [[gizzard stone]]s when butchered.
