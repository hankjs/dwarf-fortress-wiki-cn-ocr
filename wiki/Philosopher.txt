Back in version 0.28.181.40d and earlier, the [[40d:Philosopher|Philosopher]] was a noble who arrived once your population reached 100; unlike most other nobles, it had no special room requirements and made no [[mandate]]s.

In the current version, a Philosopher is merely a [[Scholar]] whose studies focus primarly on the appropriate [[Topic#Philosophy|topics]].
