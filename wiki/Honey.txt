'''Honey''' is a product [[screw_press|pressed]] from a [[honeycomb]]. Honey can be made into [[mead]] at a [[still]] (as a separate task) or used in [[cook]]ing [[prepared meal]]s. 

Honeycombs are produced by [[honey bee]]s at a [[hive]], harvested as part of the [[beekeeping_industry|beekeeping industry]]. In order to press the honeycomb, you must have a dwarf with the [[presser|pressing]] labor active, a [[screw press]], and empty [[jug]]s. A [[wax]] cake is produced as a byproduct, and a [[wax worker]] can use it to create wax crafts in the [[Craftsdwarf's workshop]]. Honey is the only animal product that can be brewed, and it, along with [[royal jelly]], are the edible products of bees. Honey has the lowest value of 1, and is brewed into 5 mead, with a value of 2 each.

Honey jugs will be stored either in a [[finished goods]] stockpile allowing the storage of "tools" or a food stockpile set to allow "animal extracts - honey bee honey". Turning it into mead works regardless, but if bins are allowed on a finished goods stockpile where honey is stored, [[hauling]] of the bins can make the honey temporarily unavailable and force the cooking or brewing jobs to cancel.
