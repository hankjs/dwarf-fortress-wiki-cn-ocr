In [[Legends]] Mode, pressing the {{k|p}} (Export Map/Gen information) will create three files in the root directory of DF, one of those files is the '''World Sites file''' named (save name)-world_sites_and_pops.txt.

== File Breakdown ==

Below, the history file will be explained in detail, using portions from an example file to show all of the possibilities.

=== Civilized World Population ===
At the top of the file, the text "Civilized World Population" appears with a listing of the total population of "civilized" beings:
