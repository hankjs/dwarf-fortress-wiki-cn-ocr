{{Main|Starting build}}

This is a collection of '''starting builds''' (or embark setups) which individual players find useful and generally worth trying.

These can be found in [[embark_profiles.txt]]. Each one begins with a [PROFILE] tag. To use a raw starting build, just copy the text and paste it at the end of the file.

== ''Dwarf Fortress'' Starter Pack ==

The ''Dwarf Fortress'' Starter Pack includes a large number of basic embark profiles, including scenarios adapted from the Masterwork mod.  If you don't want to download the whole pack, you can also find many of the profiles at https://pastebin.com/vsQgfWNH

== Nagidal's Allrounder ==

Recommended for newbies who want to play a ''defensive'' embark on sites with ''mild conditions'' (warm or temperate [[climate]], easy access to drinking [[water]], [[tree]]s and [[stone]]). 

=== Dwarves ===

According to the dwarves' [[attributes]] you assign:

* 2 Proficient [[Miner]]s (high [[Attributes#Endurance|endurance]], high [[Attributes#Willpower|willpower]], good  [[Attributes#Kinesthetic_Sense|kinesthetic sense]])
* 1 Proficient [[Mason]] (good [[Attributes#Creativity|creativity]], good endurance)
* 1 Proficient [[Mechanic]] (good [[Attributes#Analytical_Ability|analytical ability]])
* 1 Proficient [[Planter]] (good [[Attributes#Agility|agility]])
* 1 Proficient [[Wood cutter]]
* 1 Proficient [[Carpenter]]

Make one of five non-miners at least an adequate [[Appraiser]] (the one with good [[Attributes#Memory|memory]] or [[Attributes#Intuition|intuition]]).

=== Items ===

Keep all the standard stuff, sell some [[splint]]s, [[crutch]]es and [[quiver]]s to buy a couple of [[cat]]s and a dog or two. (The cats will eat the [[vermin]] trying to eat your food supplies.) You can also sell one of the battle axes or the anvil to buy even more stock or some more [[drink]]s and [[food]] if you wish.

Some dwarven [[civilization]]s start with a [[steel]] [[anvil]], rather than an [[iron]] one, which will reduce the amount of points you can use for the dwarves' skills and items. In this case, sell the anvil and rely on [[merchant]]s bringing you one.

=== First-year roadmap ===

We deliberately didn't take any [[cook]]s or [[brewer]]s. You can pick both from one of the first [[Immigration|migration waves]]. Also, we don't have any [[military]] to start with. The idea is that our mechanic and carpenter will build us many wooden cage [[trap]]s which will easily deal with the first [[ambush]]es, maybe even the first [[siege]]. Any useless migrants of the later waves will become our military.

Your aims for the first year are: farming, traps, trade, healthcare (ordered by importance)

==== Farming ====
Start [[farming]] as soon as possible. Try to harvest the spring crop of your first year. Be careful not to produce too much food. Be sure to have some [[barrel]]s or [[large pot]]s reserved for drinks rather than stuffed with [[plump helmet]]s. Thirty tiles of farm plots are more than enough to start with. If you really want to farm more, try [[pig tail]]s and get the [[textile industry]] up and running once you have more dwarves.

==== Traps ====
Build a [[mechanic's workshop]] soon and let him churn out about 2–3 dozens of [[mechanism]]s. Your carpenter should produce roughly as much wooden cages before autumn. When you build traps, build them in a one tile wide meandring corridor—preferably outdoors. There should be no way around this corridor for the enemies. Use raising [[bridge]]s to direct the flow of all enemies heading for your fort's entrance through this trap corridor. Lower the bridges to allow your dwarves fast access to the fort's entrance bypassing the trap corridor. You should have at least ten traps up and ready by autumn. To deal with a [[siege]] in the later years without fighting you better have 40 of these traps ready.

==== Trade ====
Make one of your first immigrants a [[Stone crafter|stone crafter]] and let him make stone crafts 24/7. You will need them as [[trade]] goods. Textile industry is also a good starter. If your farms produce enough pig tails, go for it and ship some fine socks to your mountain homes.

==== Healthcare ====
Before you start thinking of having some military, build a [[well]] and a [[hospital]].

== ELLIOTTCABLE's Twerking Band ==
{{User:ELLIOTTCABLE/Starting_build}}

== Albedo's 7 ==
This balance works for me, and has (built-in) some room for flexibility. I've tried to give each dwarf just one <u>dominant</u> [[Strange mood|moodable]] skill, something that would produce a desirable end product (rather than an Artifact Left Sock) - but 2 dwarves have "moodable tbd" so that any 1 task of your choice will provide that for them (if they don't do any others).*

: (* I tend to like Weaponsmith (for Artifact Weapons) - crafting one quick pick for the mining operation, or a large trap weapon (easily melted back down) - done. Or Armorer for the instant legendary skill - lots of masterwork armor pieces to make. Ymmv - you can also go by any useful [[preference]]s.)

If you're embarking in a dangerous area, lean toward more military. I find that a trained X-bow dwarf (or two!) can thin out any threat early and from a safe distance, but until you have walls you need melee skills for when anything gets up close and personal. I'd just go Armor User 5 (or 4/x-weapon 1) since Armor User is slow to train, unarmored dwarves quickly fill your [[hospital]]s, and untrained armor-wearers never seem to be able to waddle to the battle in time. I chose Axe for my one token military dwarf (below) since he'll also be the woodcutter, but Macedwarf is probably your best all-purpose choice for dedicated additional military, especially if any nearby [[tower]] may be sending [[undead]] your way. 

: 1) "Boss Axe", '''Leader'''/Security: Axe +3, Armor User +5, Appraise +1, Judge of Intent +1*
: 2) "Dirty": '''Planter''' +5/Wrestler +5 (or <u>???</u>)*
: 3) "Stoney": <u>'''Mason'''</u> +5/Stone Crafter +5 (or ???)
: 4) "Cutter": <u>'''Weaponsmith'''</u> +5/Brewer +5 (or ???)
: 5) "Hardpan": <u>'''Armorsmith'''</u> +5/Cook +5
: 6) "Cagey" <u>'''Mechanic'''</u> +5/Carpenter +5
: 7) "Striker": <u>'''Miner'''</u> +5/Siege Engineer +5 or ???)
:: ''(* <u>moodable</u> skill tbd)''
====Notes====
To start, your '''Planter''' and '''Miner''' are the only ones using their main profession close to full time. For your Haulers and misc. tasks, you can choose from the Boss, Mason, Weaponsmith, Armorsmith and Mechanic, as they follow their profession only the minimal to get the fortress started, and it takes 100+ of any one task to threaten their initial moodable skill. Later (by year 2), you'll have migrants to do the hauling and misc. tasks, and these dwarves can move toward working as full-time professionals and becoming Legendary, just like [[Armok]] intended.

The 4 "(or ???)" skills can be tweaked to suit the target environment or your own playstyle/preference. They could be military, or something else if you think you need some other starting skill more. Ymmv, and that's fine.

Against most early animal threats, the '''leader''' dwarf should be able to crush most anything non-[[ambush]] level if you give him a decent axe*. Add some quick chain armor (and some back-up!) if something serious shows up. 

: (* I start w/ one generic pick for embark, and [[Make your own weapons|DIY]] a quality bronze axe asap (followed quickly by a crossbow) - but that can take a while. If you expect trouble, start w/ a generic axe.)

The '''Planter''' will probably be working close to 24/7 on the farm. He has "Wrestler" only as a defense for when working above ground - he's not really "military grade", but it will help keep him alive if he's surprised by something unpleasant. He'd make a good crossbow candidate, as you don't want to lose him - Farming skill is a great labor multiplier, and a Farmer 5 does the work of score of dwarves compared to a Farmer 1. (You could also just lose a 2nd skill on this guy, and spend the 15 Embark points on something else, maybe another dog.)

The '''Mason''' is designed to make stone mugs in his spare time to trade to caravans (my preferred trade item), but he could do so from skill 0 - it would require (a lot) more time, but, to start, he's just Hauling, and making a few pieces of furniture, and stone blocks for fortress expansion (and to get his skill up).  So he could easily be backup military.

The '''Weaponsmith''' is also a Brewer - [[alcohol]] has no [[quality]], so this only affects the speed of brewing. But, because it's important, ''someone'' will be doing a lot of it - if not him, then pick one to skill up and hope for a talented migrant asap. If you don't love Brewer (and/or need more military), he's another good choice, but a painful one to lose if you do - another crossbowdwarf?

The '''Armorsmith''' should keep Cook - cooked food ''does'' have [[quality]], so it both keeps your dwarves happier and can be used as high-value trade goods.

The '''Mechanic''' is only a part-time Carpenter, but only a Carpenter can build [[bed]]s, and I believe it's a good thing to give dwarves good quality beds. Plus higher quality [[shield]]s for your military, and (slightly) more valuable buckets for [[well]]s. Even with a lot of trees, cutting them down and retrieving the logs is slow to train up Carpenter - I would ''not'' recommend losing this skill, even if it's not used much.

The '''Miner''' should be digging 24/7 for the first year or so, until he becomes Legendary or can be replaced by migrants. He then can be retired and given a second career, either military (in which case give him Armor User 5) or anything else that is not needed early on - gem cutter, glass maker, beekeeper, whatever.  He's not your ~best~ choice as early back-up military, since he'll often be busy very far from your front gates - and should be - but as a long-term plan Armor User works.

== Specialized builds ==
These builds are good for increasing efficiency, certain starting positions, or for starting [[megaprojects]] with minimal planning.

=== All Miners ===
:[[Embark profile repository#All miners|Download All Miners Embark Profile]]
Each dwarf also has some other vital skill as well.
Remember, you can make adjustments to this before you embark, if you feel inclined to. I added a few animals here, which you can change before embarking.

'''Challenges'''
While 7 miners are useful for building a fort quickly, it definitely isn't a good idea for every fortress. This profile doesn't include any crafting labors, which are usually helpful as an initial source of income. Brewing is '''highly''' recommended, unless you have a source of fresh water.

===Make your own weapons and tools===
{{Main|Make your own weapons}}

By eliminating the [[battle axe]]s, [[pick]]s, and other metal equipment from the starting build, and replacing them with the raw goods to [[make your own weapons]] on the spot, many points are saved. To illustrate, a [[steel]] battle axe is around 300 or 500 points; quite an expense. Iron is more affordable but still up there. But the only advantage a steel battle axe or pick has over a silver or copper one is in combat effectiveness, not wood chopping or mining. Bring a [[copper]] [[ore]] and some fuel, and that 300-point axe gets replaced with 16 points of raw ingredients.

It is possible to take this strategy to the logical extreme and to bring only raw materials, this is known as a full minmax build, see below for that variation.

===Minmax build===
:[[Embark profile repository#Minmax|Download Minmax Embark Profile]]

Taking the [[make your own weapons]] strategy to its logical extreme of removing picks and all the fancy things that are included in the default embark, the build below brings along one copper and one tin ore (enough for 8 bronze tools), some magma-safe rock to build a forge and furnaces (remember - no mining before you have a pick!), and some [[plump helmet]]s for immediate [[brewing]] and [[seed]]s+[[drink]]s.

Now, what for all those saved points? One possibility is to bring along a few pieces of [[iron]] ore to equip a basic guard just in case, or some cheaper [[tin]] to at least ensure [[bronze]] production at some point. But perhaps the best use of points is to buy a SHITLOAD OF COAL. [[Bituminous coal]] and [[lignite]] are only 3 points each at embark, as they are a basic "economic stone" rather than an ore. By bringing along some 90 or so coal, not only will there be enough for early production, squad equipping, and buying out the first two years of caravans with metal goods, but with some care literally hundreds of [[coke]] will be ready by the time the first [[magma forge]] is set up. That means mass steel production without any reliance on lucky sedimentary layers.

The dwarves' skills in this build are an afterthought, following the template of Miner/Mayor/Proficient Armorsmith, Miner/Doctor/Proficient Weaponsmith, Carpenter/Cutter, Planter/Cook, Planter/Brewer, Furnace operator/Proficient Metalcrafter, and Mason. One neat trick: there is novice training in [[armorsmith]] on both Planters, so that if they avoid doing any job but their planting/cooking, and ever go [[strange mood#Fey|fey]], that's a guaranteed [[legendary]] armorsmith. It happens more than you might think.

The profile is not completely optimized. The bags can be replaced with thread. The 16 turtles are brought along so there's something to eat between brewing all the helmets and reaping the first harvest, but 7 turtles would probably do just fine.

Upon embarking, immediately use some bauxite to build a [[wood furnace]], [[smelter]], and [[forge]]. Burn a piece of wood to charcoal, then use the charcoal to process a few units of coal. Smith an axe and two picks, build a brewery and brew all the plump helmets. Plant seeds, and then one can proceed as with the normal embark, with some 80-100 coal in the wagon.

Warning: there is a good chance that your starting civilization has neither coal nor lignite. In that case, restart the embark and try another civilization; an entire world of coalless dwarves is rare. Also, the added burrowing/starting time may prove fatal on inhospitable maps.

===Dwarves for a safer start===
This build adds some military and medical skills into the mix, so they are not defenseless. The seven dwarves are able to do all important work and you can set up two squads. When new dwarves arrive, remove hauling task (wood!) from your starting dwarves (and all new important (crafting) dwarves, so they do not run into ambushes, useless dwarves can get fishing, to scout the outside. 

At the beginning, you can give the starting dwarves all important labors like butcher, cook, brewing, plant processing, ... until you got a better dwarf for those jobs. 

Building a pen near your entrance with walls and a door (only passable for dwarves) for your sheep (stone blocks help a lot), and a pen in your entrance for your dogs to take care of thieves. Make the entrance passable for caravans (3 tiles).

Dwarves:
# Planter 5 / Leather Crafting 5 / Wood Cutting 0 (till miners are ready for inside growing)
# Weapons Smith 5 / Armor Smith 5 (this dwarf is very important)
# Mechanics 5 / Buildings Design 5 (for traps, with 5-10 spears, stones, ...)
# Diagnose 5 / Surgery Setting Bones, Suturing, Dressing Wounds  all 1, Appraiser 1*
# Mason 5 / Carpenter 5
# Mining 1 / Armor Use 5 / Dodging 4 (give him an axe and a squad and a leather armor, trouser and shield)
# Mining 1 / Armor Use 5 / Dodging 4 (give him a spear and a squad and a leather armor, trouser and shield)

: (* As your [[Broker]], without [[Judge of intent|Judge of Intent]], you will not be able to see a [[caravan]]'s mood during the first trading session. Just offer 2:1 value for the first few dozen trades, and then close to that later. He'll pick up JoI during that session to use for all later caravans.)

Items:
* iron anvil
* copper axe,
* copper picks (2)
* seeds (all 6+)
* drinks (all 21+)
* meat and fish (cheap ones with size-1 stacks for free barrels)
* leather (20-40, cheapest available)

Animals:
* 3 dogs (2 female, 1 male)
* 3-6 sheep (2-5 female, 1 male)
