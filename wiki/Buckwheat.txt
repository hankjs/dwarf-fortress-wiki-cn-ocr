'''Buckwheat''' is an [[aboveground]] [[crop]]. It can either be [[milling|milled]] into [[flour|buckwheat flour]] or [[brewing|brewed]] into [[alcohol|buckwheat beer]].

Some [[dwarves]] [[Preferences|like]] buckwheat for its ''beer''.

Note that this plant, along with the tomato, is only found in worlds with poles and a Medium or Large size, since it's unique to the Tropical Dry Broadleaf forest biome which only generates under those conditions due to a bug.
