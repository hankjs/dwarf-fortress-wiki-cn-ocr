[[File:utilities_icon.png|120px|right]]A collection of third-party '''Utilities''' that are useful for ''[[Dwarf Fortress]]'' players and [[modding|modders]] alike, of which this page serves as a list. ''Dwarf Fortress'' is a difficult game to play, and any help that can be had in the task is welcome help. 

If you would like to add an article on a ''specific'' game utility to the wiki, please do so under the <span class="plainlinks">[http://dwarffortresswiki.org/index.php?title=Special%3AAllPages&from=&to=&namespace=102 Utility]</span> namespace. 
Not included on this page: [[Main:Tileset repository|tileset repositories]] and [[Main:Graphics set repository|graphics set repositories]], due to having been given their own, separate pages. [[Modding|Mods]] have also been listed under their own <span class="plainlinks">[http://dwarffortresswiki.org/index.php?title=Special%3AAllPages&from=&to=&namespace=104 Modification] namespace. 

To avoid namespace clutter, websites ''are'' considered utilities and have been included.

A [http://www.bay12forums.com/smf/index.php?board=29.0 subsection of the Bay12 forums] is devoted to such third-party programs, and contains development threads for most of them.

[[File:dfhack_cmd.png|left|frameless|200px|]] 
DFHack is an advanced ''Dwarf Fortress'' memory access library and a set of tools and scripts using this library, providing direct object-oriented access to Dwarf Fortress's internals as if it were compiled into the game itself. Runs on Windows, macOS, and Linux (natively if supported by DF, or through [https://www.winehq.org/ Wine]). The standard configuration enables a variety of included bugfixes and interface upgrades, and provides many useful tools such as "clean all". See [[Utility:DFHack|main page]] for a summary of features, common use, and more.

== Remote playing tools ==
{{migrated section}}

=== [[Utility:Dfterm3|Dfterm3]]===

[[Utility:Dfterm3|Dfterm3]] is a remote ''Dwarf Fortress''-playing software for multiple users through a web interface. DFterm3 enables play through a web interface, and games can also be viewed on mobile - or even played if a bluetooth keyboard is attached.  The web interface should work with Chrome or Firefox browsers, but there are known problems using Internet Explorer. DFTerm3 functions via a DFHack plugin, and is thus dependent on each version of DFHack.

It is a successor to [[Utility:dfterm2|dfterm2]], which functions similarly using telnet instead of a web browser. This utility only works with version 0.34.11 or earlier.

=== [http://www.bay12forums.com/smf/index.php?topic=139167.0 Webfort] ===

Binaries are available for Windows, as well as the source (written in C++).  ''(Note: [https://github.com/mifki/df-webfort main repo] unmaintained.  [https://github.com/Ankoku/df-webfort New repo] last updated 5/22/2015.)''

DFPlex is a plugin for DFHack which introduces simultaneous, real-time online co-op to fortress mode: each player has their own independent view, cursor, menus, etc. so nobody has to wrestle for control. It's a fork of webfort, so players join just by connecting from their web browser.

Historically, [[Starter pack|starter pack]]s were used to easily configure settings, keep the game up to date, and integrate third-party mods and bugfixes. With the release of [[Release information/50.01|v50]] on Steam, much of this can be done in-game and through the Steam workshop, making starter packs no longer necessary.
