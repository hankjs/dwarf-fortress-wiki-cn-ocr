There are several situations in which a dwarf will commit actual '''suicide'''. The classic example is a [[liaison]] that is locked in and forgotten during a [[meeting]], resulting in [[insanity]] and melancholy - they will proceed to a swift end in your [[magma]] pool, [[river]] or a [[cliff]]. If no suitable spot can be found, they will fling themselves into your one-z-level moat, to no avail, and die in there of thirst and hunger. The same can happen to one of your own dwarves, for example, when they fail to finish their artifact.(''be it in normal gameplay, or as one of the ancestors themselves in [[world generation]] per se.)


Another, less obvious, case of suicide is the husband or wife that suspiciously dies at the same time as the partner. A dwarf who dies of old age will be announced as such: "died of old age" but the spouse will silently go "missing" - a sure sign that something is fishy.
