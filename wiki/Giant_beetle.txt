'''Giant beetles''' are the [[giant animal]] variant of the common [[beetle]], found in most [[savage]] [[biome]]s where they appear one at a time. Despite its disposition of being a "giant" creature and being about three times the size of a [[dwarf]], they are benign and will be of no threat to your citizens, fighting back only when forced to with [[push]]es and [[wrestling]]. All giant beetles possess Legendary [[skill]] in [[Climber|climbing]].

Giant beetles can be captured in [[cage]] [[trap]]s and [[Animal trainer|trained]] into exotic [[pet]]s, possessing the standard giant creature value. They provide a high amount of [[meat]] when [[butcher]]ed thanks to their many legs, but due to only living up to 1 year, they cannot feasibly be used in a [[meat industry]]. Like other giant animals, giant beetles are exotic [[mount]]s, but their tiny lifespan means this generally sees no use.

Some dwarves [[Preferences|like]] giant beetles for their ''protective shells''.

{{D for Dwarf}}
Contrary to [[Dwarf|dwarven]] legend, giant beetles are (unfortunately) not equipped with horns and cannot grow thick, shaggy beards similar to those of a dwarf's.
