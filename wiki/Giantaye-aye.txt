'''Giant aye-ayes''' are the [[Giant animal|super-sized]] counterpart to the common [[aye-aye]] found in tropical broadleaf forests. Giant aye-ayes are a little larger than [[grizzly bear]]s, but not as aggressive as those, instead fleeing any conflict. Only appearing rarely in a small subset of biomes, giant aye-ayes are among the more elusive animals in ''Dwarf Fortress''.

Due to their size, they yield a decent amount of returns when butchered, but the aforementioned rarity can make it difficult to obtain a breeding pair for a sustainable [[meat industry|meat production]]. Giant aye-ayes are exotic [[mount]]s, and can rarely be ridden by [[elf|elves]] in a [[siege]].

Some dwarves [[Preferences|like]] giant aye-ayes for their ''interesting fingers''.
