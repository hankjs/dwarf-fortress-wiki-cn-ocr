[[File:white_sand_floor_preview.png|thumb|160px|right|White sand floor.]]'''Sand''' is one of the many specific types of [[soil]] that can be found in ''Dwarf Fortress''.  As all sand types are [[soil]]s, above ground [[farm plot]]s can be built on them without need for [[Irrigation|irrigation]].  Sand can also be used to make [[glass]] (see below).

There are five different colors of sand – [[yellow sand]], [[white sand]], [[black sand]], [[red sand]], and [[sand (tan)|tan sand]] – but their only difference is their appearance on the ground, as there is no difference between them for purposes of [[Glass industry|glassmaking]]. Sand typically appears in [[desert]]s and along [[ocean]] beaches, but is often found in other [[biome]]s as well.

Sandy clay, sandy clay loam, sandy loam, and loamy sand are '''not''' considered sand by the game, and thus cannot be used for glassmaking.

When an underground [[tree]] grows on a muddy stone floor tile (after discovering a [[cavern]]) and is either trampled or cut down, the floor tile turns into a soil type appropriate to the [[biome]]. Although certain biomes lack soil layers altogether (such as [[mountain]]s and [[glacier]]s), their geology data still contains at least one soil type which may be a type of sand. In the case of mountains, however, the same type of soil can also be revealed on the surface by clearing away the initial layer of [[grass]] (which will not regrow once removed).

Sand, unlike normal soil, is always depicted using the {{Tile|≈|6:0}} and {{Tile|~|6:0}} symbols and cannot be furrowed, thus causing unpaved sand [[road]]s to be covered in grass and vegetation much more quickly.

[[Grass]], whether above-ground or subterranean, can grow on sand and cause it to become unavailable for collection, giving the message "Urist McBagger cancels Collect Sand: Sand vanished" if the job is in progress, or "Urist McBagger cancels Collect Sand: Need valid, active sand collection zone" if the job is new. You can easily remove the grass ''and'' prevent it from growing back by building a paved [[road]] ({{menu icon|b|n|O}}) over the grass; the paved road will ''not'' prevent the sand from being collected.  You can also put a floor [[grate]] over a sand floor to prevent growth while allowing sand to be collected, but you must first remove the grass/sapling/shrub; you can do this by placing a dirt road over it.

==Glass==
:''See also: [[Glass industry|Glass industry]]''
Sand is used in the production of [[glass|green and clear glass]] items at a [[glass furnace]] ([[glass|crystal glass]] requires rough [[rock crystal]] in its place). 

===Collecting Sand===
To collect sand, first locate some appropriate sand tiles, appearing as "[Color] Sand [Tile]" when you hover over a tile. Next, set a sand collection [[zone]] over or next to the sand tiles, by pressing {{menu icon|z}} and then designating the sand tiles as an activity zone (note that sand can be collected from adjacent sand walls, even diagonally). Then, you must build a [[glass furnace]] and activate the collect sand task. 

Each dwarf collecting sand will require a [[bag]], only one dwarf will collect sand per furnace, and no other tasks can be performed at the furnace while sand is being collected. Sand collection requires the "Item Hauling" [[labor]].  The bags of sand will not be taken to the glass furnace; they are left in the sand collection zone, until hauled or dumped or selected for a glass-making job.  Note that any sand tile holds an infinite amount of sand.

Filled bags of sand are considered [[furniture]], and. as such, require the "Furniture Hauling" labor to move. Sand bags are stored in furniture [[stockpile]]s with "sand bags" enabled (located under "type"). Note: You must also allow all items under "Core Quality" and "Total Quality" unless you want them to only store certain quality type bags in your stockpiles.

Collected sand is listed under [[powder]] on the [[stocks]] menu.  However, if you attempt to dump the sand from this section, the dwarves will dump it from the bags{{bug|3220}} and drop it in useless piles on the floor (as if it were a [[contaminant]]) - this will also happen if you attempt to use {{menu icon|i}} to mass designate sand bags for dumping. Going to the stocks screen and removing the dump order on the sand itself will make the dwarves dump the bags and not the contents, but this must be done before any dwarf can start a sand-dumping job.

To get bags to fill with sand for your fortress, create a [[leather]] bag at a [[leather works]] or a [[cloth]] bag at a [[clothier's shop]], or buy the bags from a caravan. To have sand bags stored near your glass furnace, create a furniture [[stockpile]] with only "sand bags" enabled but with all materials and quality levels still permitted. It may be useful to construct several glass furnaces so that you can have several "collect sand" jobs queued on them at the same time, which helps ensure that you have enough filled sand bags on hand to keep your glassmaker(s) supplied.  To create a reoccurring work order filling sand bags you have to manually set a condition.  That condition should have the type set to "items" and the adj set to "sand-bearing" so that it reads "sand-bearing items".  Set the other conditions as normal.

==Availability==
Not all embark locations have sand available. While this may prevent the establishment of a full glass industry, it does not outright prevent the making of glass at all - individual bags of sand may be purchased during [[embark]] for 1 point apiece (with a free [[bag]] included), and caravans will frequently bring several bags of sand with them each year (plus more, if requested from the [[liaison]]). Additionally, while it is rare, some caverns may contain sand in small amounts.

It is wise to always keep several bags of sand on hand, in order to deal with [[strange mood]]s requiring glass.

Some dwarves don't like sand because it is coarse and rough and irritating and it gets everywhere.
