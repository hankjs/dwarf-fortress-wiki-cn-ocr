'''Albatrosses''' are a species of [[Creature|bird]] found inhabiting the coasts of [[ocean]]s, appearing in groups of anywhere between 1-10 individuals. They do little but fly through the air, and are only slightly bigger than a [[cat]], being benign and harmless to [[dwarves]]. They may scare [[pasture]]d livestock if they're on the surface, however, leading to repeated re-pasturing jobs. All albatrosses are born with Legendary [[skill]] in [[Climber|climbing]].

Albatrosses can be captured in [[cage]] [[trap]]s and [[animal trainer|trained]] into cheap [[pet]]s. They produce more returns when [[butcher]]ed than domestic birds, but the effort of catching and breeding them is, perhaps, too great - if put in a [[nest box]], they only lay a single [[egg]] at a time, making them terrible for [[egg production]].

Some dwarves [[Preferences|like]] albatrosses for their ''large wings''.
