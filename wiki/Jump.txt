'''Jumping''' is a means of crossing otherwise uncrossable obstacles. Unlike with [[climber|climbing]], there is no associated skill with jumping.

Most creatures can jump - those that cannot; have the {{token|CANNOT_JUMP|creature}} tag.

== Fortress mode ==
In [[dwarf fortress mode]], dwarves and other creatures will sometimes jump, usually when trying to get to an enemy on the far side of water. This has implications for [[Defense guide|fortress defense]]. One-tile moats, for example, are unlikely to be a significant obstacle to [[invader]]s, and your own dwarves may opt to leap from your defenses to complete an already-active job. Jumping creature are shown with an "airborne" [[status icon]].

== Adventurer mode ==
In [[adventurer mode]], your adventurer can jump by using the {{adv menu icon|j}} key. If your adventurer is walking, the jump is limited to two squares. By setting {{adv menu icon|m}} the walking [[Gait|speed]] to "Sprint" or "Run" and picking up speed until the maximum is reached, the distance you can jump is drastically increased. Indeed, this even allows an adventurer untrained in [[swimmer|swimming]] to cross [[river]]s.

Jumping can also be used in combat - provided it hits, it will send similarly-sized targets flying, do some damage to them (both from "skidding on the ground", and from collision with something - sometimes even another enemy) and leave them stunned for easy follow-up attacks until they recover. It can also be used to knock enemies that are wrestling your companions away. Since wrestling prevents dodging, this will always connect.
