'''Monasteries''' ([[File:icon_site_monastery.png]] / {{Raw Tile|○|7:0:0}}) are a type of [[religion|religious]] site, taking up a 3×3 square of tiles on an embark map, and are built by monastic orders, which are headed by an abbot.

They always have one each of the following structures: a dormitory which will be lined with beds, a canteen which will contain two rows of tables and chairs of wildly-varying materials, a warehouse consisting of a few empty rooms, and a [[temple]], a religious site in the shape of a multi-floor rectangular building with engraved walls and statues scattered about. The engravings and statues are predominantly religious in nature, featuring the [[deity|object of worship]] and the ascension of custom-named [[priest]]s. On the bottom-most floor, [[pedestal]]s are kept for storing [[artifact]]s. 

In addition to the main four structures, there will be a number of [[Temple#Shrines|shrine]]s, statues standing outside, surrounded with varying patterns in the earth. There is a maximum of five shrines to a monastery, though it is currently unknown if the minimum number is 1 or 0. These shrines will sometimes have small altars beside them, which will sometimes contain divination [[dice]].

Monasteries may be the destinations of [[pilgrim]]s, who travel there to see the site, or stop there; on the way to [[temple|a more prominent holy place]]. They are also populated by [[prophet]]s.
