'''Trade agreements''' are made with the [[dwarf|dwarven]] and [[human]] [[civilization]] by meeting the [[liaison]] or treasurer, respectively.

Existing trade agreements can be checked via the {{menu icon|Y}} world screen, {{DFtext|Civilizations|7:2:1}} button, and hovering the mouse pointer over the civilization.

Both the selling and buying prices of items included in the trade agreement are raised (multiplied by the corresponding percentage value), regardless of who requested the items.

Trade agreements do not (directly) result in next years caravan bringing more items, it just results in next years caravan first loading up-to four items of the types requested (but might end up with packing less, if the weight limit is already exceeded or the maximum number of items to load is exceeded) and then, if still under the item count to bring (and under the weight limit), "emergency supplies" and random goods will be added to the cargo. But indirectly, if light goods (like cut gems) are requested en masse, it can mean that the caravan will pack more goods, because it will not surpass its weight limit (which it otherwise might exceed).

The trade agreement negotiation (pre-barony) give about 500 exp (possibly always 496 exp), divided between the learnable skills used in the trade negotiation. Negotiator getting the largest share of exp, followed by judge of intent (roughly 2/3 of negotiator), followed by persuasion and liar (roughly half of judge of intent) and the least amount given to intimidator and flattery (roughly half of persuasion). The other social skills (not mentioned above) do not get any exp for trade negotiations. And the creatures of both parties involved in the trade negotiations (ie. your mayor and the outpost liaison) get the same amount of experience. It could be that trade agreement negotiations after becoming a barony give more exp.

==Duration==
Trade agreements will not be available when the liaison appears on-screen to provide space for the next year's agreement. Unfortunately, this means that, to consult the trade agreements prior to hauling goods over, it is necessary to remember them, take a screenshot, or to predict the arrival of the traders. Despite this, the previous agreement will still apply to the trade caravan that arrived around the same time as the liaison.
