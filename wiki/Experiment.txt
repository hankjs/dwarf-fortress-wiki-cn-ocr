[[File:experiment_sprite_preview.png|right]]'''Experiments''' {{Tile|A|4:1}}-{{Tile|Z|2:1}} are procedurally-generated [[night creature]]s, "created" by [[necromancer]]s or certain [[demon|goblin leaders]] who experiment on captured citizens and livestock. They can be disallowed in [[Advanced_world_generation#Allow_Divination.2C_Experiments.2C_and_Necromancy_types|advanced world generation]].

Graphically, the sprites that non-intelligent experiments use will be of randomly-generated creatures with random colors that resemble the generated appearance they've been given. Intelligent experiments are given their own unique humanoid sprites based on their generated appearance.

==Characteristics==
{{imagefix|[[File:experiment_portrait_anim.gif|left]]|7|0}}[[File:Experiment janus.jpg|thumb|200px|Horrible experiments gone wrong or right?<br><small>''Art by JimmyNijs''</small>]]A species of experiment is created as the result of a necromancer or demon performing horrible experiments on people or animals. 

Experiments (''other than the initial subject'') are able to reproduce through normal means, assuming they have both male and female castes. 

There are failed and successful experiments, with the latter coming in many forms, depending on the source material. Every experimenter may create up to four species of experiment: one (sapient) humanoid, one small and one large creature type with 4 or more legs, and one giant amalgamation.{{cite forum|169696/8020553}} The giant amalgamation is created from multiple creatures, instead of just one, and is, as its name suggests, very large. Failed experiments, meanwhile, often come in the form of blobs, snakes, and worms, or armless bipeds with or without wings. The species, or even general shape of the experiment (save for the humanoid ones) is usually not preserved between experimentations (for example: horrible experiments on sheep may result in maggot-shaped creatures).

Experiments sometimes escape into the wild, and intelligent ones can rejoin civilization - in the latter case, they may become playable race options in adventurer mode - in fact, you can unretire an adventurer who died and was subsequently revived as a necromancer experiment, and their relationships will be preserved. Otherwise, experiments found at [[Tower (necromancy)|necromancers' towers]] will be loyal to their creator (following the "Identify yourself!" behavior and attacking if you give an unwelcome name). Experiments near necromancer towers can also be [[Undead|animated corpses]], giving them the immunities that undead have alongside any potential benefits their forms have. Sometimes experiment [[children]] can be found in the prisons of a [[dark fortress]] among other snatched children; this can happen from either a child being abducted and transformed into an experiment child or reproduction producing a child, both valid targets for [[Thief#Goblin_snatchers|snatching]].

Despite their various forms, all experiments possess certain uniform traits, being [[fanciful]] creatures who do not require any form of sustenance, sport immunity to [[No Pain|pain]], [[No Exert|exertion]], [[No Stun|stunning]], nausea, fevers or dizziness, and can survive both on land and [[Water|underwater]]. They can also be [[building destroyer]]s, [[Trapavoid|unaffected by traps]], [[Creature_token#EXTRAVISION|see everything]], and may even be generated with the ability to secrete extracts which can inflict [[Syndrome|night sickness]], including the ability to fly.
Their size varies depending on the type of experiment, with the smaller ones being comparable to a [[dwarf]] or [[human]], larger quadrupeds being around the size of a [[horse]] or [[yak]], and amalgamations being almost as large as a [[giant]]. All experiments appear to be associated with the [[sphere]]s of deformity and night.

Unlike other night creatures, experiments are represented by regular alphabet letters, upper or lower case indicating size.  Successful intelligent experiments are colored red, while failed creations and any others (quadrupeds, amalgamations etc.) are colored green. The name of the experimenter will always be included in their description, crediting them for their creation and telling the [[Calendar|date]] they were created, even if you play as an adventurer experiment.

Experiments may, rarely, wear items like rings. They cannot become [[vampire]]s, [[werebeast]]s, or [[necromancer]]s, due to their supernatural nature. Their names seem to be based on the creator, the place they were created, a deity (likely one associated with death or deformity), or just a generic, menacing-sounding name. Examples are "Obler's Hand", "Severesuppers's Eye", "Demon of Night", "Xakedkicu's Mistake", etc. 

'''Nouns of sapient experiments are: Demon, Eye, Fist, Hand, Soldier, and Warrior.'''

Dwarves will never have an (unmodded) [[preference]] for experiments, as they possess no {{token|PREFSTRING}}. They have an unused [[pet]] value of 2,000.

{{D for Dwarf}}
Amalgamations are known to be attracted by the smell of [[potato]] chips.

Necromancers may sometimes pet their horrific failed experiments.

==Trivia==
*The bodily makeup of some experiments can make playing an adventure mode game extremely difficult. For example, an experiment may excrete boiling steam constantly, catching oneself and everyone else in the clouds of steam, which in turn causes constant message spam of everyone nearby getting caught in a cloud of steam, making gameplay nearly impossible.
