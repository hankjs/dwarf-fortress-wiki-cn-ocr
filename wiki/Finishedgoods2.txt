[[File:finished_goods_preview.png|right]]'''Finished goods''' are items that go to a finished goods [[stockpile]] when made. Many of these items are frequently referred to as trade goods as they are lightweight and suitably valuable for [[trading]]. They include '''crafts''', '''goblets''', '''instruments''', '''toys''' and '''totems''', some of which have several subtypes.

Finished good types with several subtypes may have generic workshop orders to produce random subtype items, e.g. "Make crafts". Additionally, some specific subtypes of goods can be ordered directly at an appropriate workshop or through the [[manager]]. If you have a mandate to make rings, you can order rings directly, instead of waiting for a generic "crafts" job to produce rings; others, like puzzleboxes, though, can only be produced by generic jobs ("toys").

Some types of trade goods (crafts and goblets) can be produced in multiples. It is possible to get up to three crafts from a single resource. Skill does not affect the chance to produce multiples.

==Types of trade goods==

===Clothing===
{{main|Clothing}}
All clothing is stored in finished goods piles. Dwarves will replace their worn-out clothing automatically. Clothes can also be exported, but they are not especially valuable, unless they're made of exotic materials, like [[giant cave spider]] [[silk]].

===Crafts===
{{imagefix|[[File:figurine_sprite.png|left]]|11}} Crafts include all '''[[jewelry]]''' (specifically '''amulets''', '''bracelets''', '''crowns''', '''earrings''' and '''rings'''), '''[[figurine]]s''', and '''[[scepter]]s'''. If producing a specific subtype (e.g. "craft ring" or "craft scepter"), one item is produced from one resource material. If the general, non-specific work order is chosen, to "make crafts", one resource is consumed, however this produces one to three random items (two on average). In this case, all subtypes that can be produced from the chosen material have an identical % chance to be produced.

Jewelry items (including amulets) can be claimed and worn by dwarves, similar to any piece of clothing. [[Figurine]]s may be claimed and carried as personal items, and [[scepter]]s can be assigned (via the [[Noble]]s screen) as a token of office. No hand-held craft item interferes with [[labor]].

Some subtypes of crafts can reference [[historical figure]]s and events (figurines, for example); this does not have any meaningful effect on the value of the craft.

Gem and glass crafts cannot be made directly. They may only be produced randomly by gem cutting jobs.

===Flasks===
{{main|Flask}}
Metal flasks are made at a [[metalsmith's forge]]. Leather flasks are called '''waterskins''', and are made in a [[leather works]]. Glass flasks are called '''vials''', and are made in a [[glass furnace]]. Any of these can be used by soldiers and hunters, allowing them to transport water or booze for drinking while pursuing their combat duties. Glass vials, only, can also be used used to make [[extract]]s.

===Goblets===
[[File:goblet_sprite.png]] / {{Tile|¶|7:1}} Goblets have no subtypes, but have different names depending on the material from which they are made: [[metal]] and [[glass]] goblets are simply '''goblets''', [[stone]] goblets are called '''mugs''', and [[wood]]en goblets are called '''cups'''.

Goblets are always produced at a 3:1 ratio. Metal goblets are made at a [[metalsmith's forge]]. Glass goblets are made at a [[glass furnace]]. Rock mugs and wooden cups are made at a [[craftsdwarf's workshop]].

Goblets can be used by dwarves for [[drink]]ing. If no goblets are available in a dining room stockpile or a coffer in a [[tavern]], a thirsty dwarf can drink [[alcohol]] straight from the [[barrel]], but this will result in an unhappy [[thought]]. If a dwarf is unable to use their arms, they will stall on picking up a goblet rather than drinking straight from the barrel{{bug|9440}}. Goblets can also be used to transport liquids in [[adventurer mode]].

===Instruments===
{{main|Instruments}}
[[File:instrument_sprite.png]] / {{Tile|¿|7:1}} Instruments can be composed of one or more components made from specific materials. The presence of multiple high-value components can increase the trade value of an instrument far beyond any other finished good. Instruments can also be used by [[performer]]s in [[tavern]]s or [[temple]]s.

===Toys===
[[File:toys_sprites.png]] / {{Tile|æ|7:1}} Toys include '''mini-forges''', '''toy hammers''', '''toy axes''', '''toy boats''', and '''puzzleboxes''' created at a craftsdwarf's workshop. Dwarven children can play with toys.

===Totems===
[[File:skull_sprite.png]] / {{Tile|ç|7:1}} Totems are made from [[skull]]s by a [[bone carver]] at a [[craftsdwarf's workshop]]. Although totems have the same base [[value]] as all other crafts, totems made from the skulls of more valuable animals, like [[unicorn]]s, will fetch a hefty price.

===Large gems===
[[File:large_rock_gem_sprite.png]] / {{Tile|♦|7:1}} Large gems have no subtypes. Large gems can be ordered to be cut from most materials, with gems and glass being two notable exceptions. For standard [[gem]] gems, a gem cutting job will produce a large gem 5% of the time; for [[glass]] gems, it's 33%. It can be assumed that this represents the rarity of large gem-quality rough gemstones, and the difficulty of creating thick, evenly-structured glass pieces. 

Large gems currently have little use beyond trade. Some dwarves (with a preference for large gems) might claim large gems in order to satisfy their need to acquire an object. They are also listed as possible "bait" in [[animal trap]]s, but do not function. They can be placed in a 1-tile stockpile to act as bait for [[Thief|thieving]] creatures, with standard [[trap]]s or a [[Trap_design#Trap_Designs|more complex welcoming system]] nearby.*

: * Note that while thieving animals, such as [[macaque]]s and [[kea]]s, will trigger standard traps, intelligent [[thief|thieves]] such as kobolds or goblins can bypass those. Any thief will, however, trigger a [[pressure plate]] that has been set to detect creatures of the appropriate size (including "flying" or "swimming" ones that pass through that tile).

==Materials==
Most materials can be used to make trade goods - on occasion, a [[dwarf]] in a [[strange mood]] will make a trade good out of a material not normally suited for it (e. g., a bone toy).

<sup>1</sup> Instruments and their components are procedurally generated items; the materials they can be made from depend on the particular world.

<sup>2</sup> Wooden toys can only be made using the job [[manager]], as the craftsdwarf's workshop interface does not permit selecting them. {{bug|3119}}

<sup>3</sup> [[Adamantine]] cloth cannot be used to make crafts. (Adamantine crafts can be created at a [[metalsmith's forge]]).

<sup>4</sup> Amulets, earrings and bracelets are the only crafts that can be produced from [[leather]], [[plant]] cloth, and [[silk]] cloth. All crafts can be produced from [[yarn]] cloth.

<sup>5</sup> Skull totems, like bone crafts, are made by a bone carver at a craftsdwarf's workshop.

<sup>6</sup> Prior to v50, crafts and large gems were produced randomly by cutting jobs at a [[jeweler's workshop]], with the [[gem cutting]] labor. Raw glass possibly has a 33% chance to be cut into a large gem or a craft (with 11 crafts for every 16 large gems). Raw gems have a 5% chance to be cut into a large gem or a craft (with 1 craft for every 8 large gems).

{{D for Dwarf}}

<!-- Reference: the fact that boats cannot be built in Dwarf Fortress because of cave-ins -->
The existence of toy boats indicates that the dwarf civilization does have the concept of using specialized vehicles to travel on water. However, due to the nature of [[Physics |Urist's principle]], there is some difficulty in scaling them up to a usable level.

<!-- Reference: Nintendo "GameCube" video game console -->
Some dwarven children insist on calling puzzleboxes "game cubes". Scholars have yet to determine why.
