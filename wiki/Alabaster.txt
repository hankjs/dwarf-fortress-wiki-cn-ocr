'''Alabaster''' is a fine-grained variety of [[gypsum]]. It is found within gypsum in small [[cluster]]s, and can likewise be used to make [[plaster]]. There is no in-game difference between the two materials, except in coloration.

== In real life ==

Alabaster typically refers to two varieties of stone: the fine-grained varietal of gypsum, as in Dwarf Fortress; and fine-grained [[calcite]].
