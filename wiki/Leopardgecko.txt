'''Leopard geckos''' are a species of [[vermin]] that can be found in [[desert]]s. They may be captured by [[trapper]]s and turned into low-value [[pet]]s. All leopard geckos possess Legendary [[skill]] in [[Climber|climbing]].

Some [[Dwarf|dwarves]] [[Preferences|like]] leopard geckos for their ''coloration''.
