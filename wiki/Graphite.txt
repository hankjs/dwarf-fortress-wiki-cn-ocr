'''Graphite''' is a [[stone]] found within certain [[metamorphic layer]]s.  Graphite is flammable on contact with [[magma]], but will never ''melt'', meaning burning graphite makes an excellent long-burning flame - a single boulder will burn for about nine and a half months before being consumed. This quality has applications in some fire-based [[trap design|traps]].

==In real life==
Graphite is the most common form of carbon under standard Earth temperatures and pressures. It sits around 1.5 on the Mohs scale, making it a very soft substance. Synthetic Graphite is relatively easy to produce via compression.

Graphite's applications include steelmaking, lubricants, batteries, and of course, pencil "lead."
