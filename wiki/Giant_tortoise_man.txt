'''Giant tortoise men''' are [[animal people]] variants of the common [[giant tortoise]] who can be found in [[savage]] [[tropical]] [[shrubland]]s and [[savanna]]s. They spawn in groups of 5-10 individuals and are mostly non-aggressive, but will defend themselves from those who get too close. In terms of size, they are three times the size of a [[dwarf]] and will generally overpower any [[peasant]] who attempts to pick a fight with them.

Like other savage animal people, they can join [[civilization]]s, become [[historical figure]]s, appear as [[visitor]]s and be playable in [[adventurer mode]].

Some dwarves [[Preferences|like]] giant tortoise men for their ''great size''.
