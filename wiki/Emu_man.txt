'''Emu men''' are [[animal people]] variants of the common [[emu]], who inhabit [[savage]] [[temperate]] [[forest]]s and [[shrubland]]s, spawning in groups of anywhere between 1-5 individuals, and are generally content to keep to themselves. In terms of size, they are a little smaller than the average [[dwarf]].

Like other savage animal people, emu men can join [[civilization]]s, become [[historical figure]]s, appear as [[visitor]]s and be playable in [[adventurer mode]].

Some dwarves [[Preferences|like]] emu men for their ''size'' and their ''inquisitive nature''.
