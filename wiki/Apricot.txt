'''Apricot''' is one of the many genera of [[tree]]s found above ground. Like the vast majority of above ground trees, apricot [[wood]] is brown and produces brown products. Logs can be processed in a [[dyer's shop]] into pink [[dye]].

Apricot trees, obviously, bear apricot [[fruit]]. Apricots are able to be brewed into [[alcohol]], cooked or eaten raw, so it may be a good idea to build a food [[industry]] partially around a native population of apricot trees.

Some [[Dwarf|dwarves]] [[Preferences|like]] apricot trees for their ''fruit''.
