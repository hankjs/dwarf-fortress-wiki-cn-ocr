'''Saltpeter''' is a non-economic and low-value yellow [[stone]] found in [[vein|small clusters]] within [[sedimentary layer]]s. With a melting point of {{ct|10601}} and a boiling point of only {{ct|10720}}, it is one of the few stones which will ''boil'' in [[magma]]. Saltpeter is also the second least [[Density|dense]] non-economic stone*, making it better than most stone for objects that must be hauled frequently. 

: ''(*  Saltpeter is about 60% heavier than [[jet]], more than 21% lighter than typical stone, but about 350% (3 1/2 times) the weight of typical [[wood]] items.)''

In real life, its best known use is as a primary ingredient of gunpowder, along with [[charcoal]] and [[brimstone|sulfur]]. This process does not exist in ''Dwarf Fortress'' (yet; it seems [[Toady One]] has plans to include gunpowder later, but only for simple uses[https://www.bay12games.com/media/df_talk_8_transcript.html]), and therefore gunpowder is also non-existent. Saltpeter, as a source of both potassium (like [[potash]]) and nitrogen, is also a fertilizer, though it is not possible to use it as such in ''Dwarf Fortress''.

<!-- Reference: Saltpeter's use in Gunpowder, as described above -->
It is rumored that if a dwarf ever discovers saltpeter's capabilities, dwarven "civilization" would come to an explosive, but [[Fun]] end.

<!-- Referemce: the myth that Potassium Nitrate induces impotence -->
Despite persistent myths to the contrary, adding saltpeter to your male dwarves' military rations will ''not'' help to control your fortress's population ''or'' reduce incidences of romantic infidelity.
