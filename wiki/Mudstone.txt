'''Mudstone''' is an unremarkable [[sedimentary]] [[stone]].

Mudstone cavern floors do not count as [[mud]], and are thus unsuitable for [[farming]] (''unless one subjects them to [[irrigation]], of course''). 

==In Real Life==
Mudstone is a fine grained sedimentary rock which originates from [[clay]] and [[mud]]. With increased pressure over time, the clay minerals can form into parallel layers. This finely bedded material that splits readily into thin slices is then called [[shale]].
