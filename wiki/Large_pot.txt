'''Pots''', also known as '''large pots''', are containers that function much like [[barrel]]s, and have the same capacity, but can be made from materials other than wood or metal, such as [[stone]], [[ceramic]], and [[glass]]. The game refers to these containers sometimes as "pot" and sometimes as "large pot" but there is no actual distinction. Graphically, if a pot is empty, the sprite will show a pot with no lid; if it is filled with a specific type of item, the top of the pot will have the matching items sticking out of the top, which also applies for liquids. If the pot contains content such as [[slurry]], paste or [[tallow]], the pot will have a lid.

For most uses, large pots can replace [[barrel]]s. However, stone pots are usually heavier than wooden barrels, so tasks that require moving stone barrels may be slowed to some extent compared to wooden ones. (See "[[Large pot#Material selection|material selection]]", below).

Note, however, that large pots cannot replace barrels in all situations. Some tasks may ''specifically'' require "barrels" (eg. "Process Plant to Barrel"), and some workshops '''specify''' a <u>barrel</u> for their construction, e.g. an [[ashery]] or [[dyer's shop]]. Large pots cannot be encrusted with gems at a [[jeweler's workshop]], despite being stored in the Furniture stockpile.

Large pots can be made from stone by a [[stone crafter]] at a [[craftsdwarf's workshop]], [[ceramic]] at a [[kiln]], [[glass]] at a [[glass furnace]], [[wood]] at a [[craftsdwarf's workshop]], or [[metal]] at a [[metalsmith's forge]]. Pots made from stone, [[stoneware]], [[glass]], [[wood]], [[porcelain]], [[metal]], or [[glaze]]d [[earthenware]] are water-tight and can be used to store liquids, and even for [[brewing]]. Unglazed earthenware can only be used for storing dry items. Metal pots are made using the [[metalcrafting]] skill, as opposed to metal barrels, which use the [[blacksmithing]] skill. 

Pots are stored in the Large Pots/Food Storage section of the Furniture stockpile. Empty pots are listed under Tools when viewing the fortress's [[stocks]] or when moving them to a [[trade depot]].  Pots are hauled using the Haul Item labor.

Large pots take up 500 units of volume. Same as barrels, pots can hold up to 60 prepared meals, plants, or cheeses, 30 pieces of meat or fish, any number of units of brewed [[alcohol]] (but only a single stack), 100 units of [[lye]] or [[milk]], or 6000 [[egg]]s regardless of size.

== Material selection ==
As with other containers, several factors are relevant in choosing the proper material for making large pots. Namely, availability, value, fire/magma safety, vermin resistance, <s>hippie</s> elf kosherness, and most importantly '''weight'''.

Pots made from stone of typical* [[Density#Density of some materials|density]] will be 33% heavier than typical* wooden barrels. Fire clay "stoneware" pots weigh the same as a wooden barrel, while earthenware pots are lighter but must be glazed. This makes large stone pots superior for any stockpile that does not require the containers to be moved, such as [[Kitchen|prepared meals]]. Ceramic pots are superior to typical wood in all cases.
: (*There are exceptionally light or heavy examples of both stone and wood, but the majority of types of each fall into a "typical" weight category.)

Pots are only 1/4 as heavy<sup>[http://www.bay12forums.com/smf/index.php?topic=127471.msg4342164#msg4342164]</sup> as barrels <u>made from the same material</u> (e.g. metal, glass). This means metal pots are generally a better storage option than metal barrels, saving the industry precious dwarf-hours by hauling faster due to lighter containers. Additionally, a metal barrel costs '''3''' bars, but a metal pot only '''1''', making metal barrels a vastly less attractive option.

But in the case of large pots, stone is typically used chiefly due to its abundance, especially for young outposts. Doing so will conserve wood (likely the only other economic choice) for tasks for which stone cannot be used (and metal is not always practical), such as making [[bed]]s, [[bin]]s, [[bucket]]s, [[cage]]s, [[charcoal]], [[crutch]]es and [[splint]]s, [[pipe section]]s, [[stepladder]]s, [[training weapon]]s, [[wheelbarrow]]s, and many other items* of various usefulness and importance.
: (*[[Crossbow]]s and [[bolt]]s could fall here, too, but those often deserve to be made of a weapons-grade metal.)

Unless, of course, the embark location has trees aplenty, making it viable to use wood for most everything, including pots, though this obviously requires a sufficient amount of woodcutters, wood crafters, axes, and contempt towards the <s>tree-huggers</s> elves.

== Forging and melting ==

* Metal pots cost '''one''' [[metal]] bar to forge, or '''one''' [[adamantine]] wafer.

* When a pot is [[Melt item|melted]] down, it will return '''0.3''' metal bars/adamantine wafers for an efficiency of '''30%'''.

== Bugs ==
* Pots will not be used for processing [[sweet pod]]s into [[dwarven syrup]]. {{Bug|4356}}
* Dwarves will sometimes leave pots in furniture stockpile even when using them to store food. {{Bug|1833}}
