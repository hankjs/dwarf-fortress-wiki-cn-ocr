'''Sewers''' are underground networks of tunnels found below the streets of a [[town]]. Most sewer tunnels are partially flooded with water, making exploration possible. Water is sourced from nearby [[river]]s. Sewers with no nearby flowing rivers will be completely dry instead. Towns with sewers have visible [[floor grate]]s in the middle of streets.

All sewers have at least one {{DFtext|Sewer Access|5:1}}, as shown in the fast travel screen. The entrances are simple downward ramps or stairs that directly lead down to a walkable section of the sewers. An alternative entryway involves entering through a flooded tunnel by swimming under the river, but unless you're [[amphibious]] or don't require breathing, this method poses a high risk of drowning. [[Catacombs]] can also connect into sewers.

Items and corpses can be found on the floor. If the world has [[cavern]]s present, subterranean [[animal people]] will settle in the sewers. These outcasts will wander around the flooded sections and attack you on sight{{Verify}}. They are armed with [[spear]]s and [[blowgun]]s. Be careful not to dodge into the water without at least an {{DFtext|Adequate|7:1}} [[swimming]] skill, lest the fall stun and drown you. Wild animals with {{token|AMPHIBIOUS|c}} and {{token|LARGE_PREDATOR|c}} tags (e.g. [[alligator]]s) can also take up residence in the sewers.
