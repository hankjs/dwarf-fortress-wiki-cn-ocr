'''Indigo tourmaline''' is one of the higher-value, semi-precious [[gem]]s that can be found within [[sedimentary]] and [[metamorphic]] stone layers, as well as within [[granite]]. Scoring a ×25 multiplier, the same as [[clear zircon]], these are great for saving for later, when you have great gem-cutters and gem-setters, to get very high-value objects.
