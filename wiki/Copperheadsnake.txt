'''Copperhead snakes''' are tiny, solitary, [[Syndrome|venomous]] [[creature]]s who inhabit [[temperate]] broadleaf [[forest]]s and [[wetland|swamps]]. They can inject a poison that causes nausea and pain, and swelling of the affected area, which wears off after not too much time, though they're typically too small to successfully puncture a [[dwarf]]'s skin. Like other snakes, they continuously grow through their entire lives, reaching their max size at the age of 20, though some copperheads may die of old age as soon as they reach the age of 10. Even when fully grown, however, they are among the smallest creatures in the game who aren't [[vermin]].

Copperhead snakes can be captured in [[cage]] [[trap]]s and [[Animal trainer|trained]] into exotic [[pet]]s. They are born adults and as such can't be fully tamed. They are too small to give anything but a [[skull]] when [[butcher]]ed and, unlike most reptiles, they give live birth instead of laying [[egg]]s, making them entirely unusable for a [[meat industry]]. A [[totem]] made out of a copperhead's skull, however, will be [[Multiply value|twice]] more valuable than a normal one.

Some dwarves [[Preferences|like]] copperhead snakes for their ''attractive scale patterns''.

All attempts by dwarf-kind to extract the [[copper]] in their heads have failed, leading some to believe that copperhead snakes do not contain any copper at all.
