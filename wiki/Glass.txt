[[File:glass_preview.png|right]]'''Glass''' is produced at the [[glass furnace]] using [[fuel]] with either [[sand]] (green glass), sand and [[pearlash]] (clear glass), or [[rock crystal]] and [[pearlash]] (crystal glass). A [[magma glass furnace]] can also be used, in which case no fuel is required.  Raw glass (of all three types) can also be acquired from some [[trading|trade]] caravans and be purchased in the [[embark]] screen.  You have to buy or collect [[sand]] to get the raw materials to make glass.

Glass value corresponds to the difficulty of its production, with green glass having the lowest material value (2), clear glass, intermediate (5), and crystal glass, the highest (10).

== Uses ==
Glass can be used for most things that can be produced at a [[Stoneworker's workshop]], except slabs, querns and millstones.  Glass can also be used to make [[tube]]s.  Note that the names for some glass products are different from the same products made from different materials. For example, a glass tube has the same uses as a wooden pipe. It can also be used to produce goods normally made at a [[craftsdwarf's workshop]] by a [[stone crafter]], except obsidian short swords and generic crafts. In addition, it may be made as raw glass, which can then be cut as a gem at a [[jeweler's workshop]] by a [[gem cutter]], similarly to cutting generic stones. Note that raw glass '''''cannot''''' be made into glass items (excluding [[strange mood]]s), but can only be cut into [[gem]]-like items which can be used for [[decoration|decorating]] items.

Raw glass, especially raw green glass, is excellent practice for aspiring jewelers (and its production provides experience for [[glassmaker]]s). The value of glass is on par with low-to-mid value gemstones, meaning that a source of sand on your map used in tandem with a [[magma glass furnace]] makes decoration with cut raw green glass an essentially free, and very lucrative, way to increase the value of your goods, while training legendary [[glassmaker]]s and [[jeweler]]s – particularly when those goods are themselves made of glass.

Glass can also be made into [[block]]s which can be used to build [[workshop]]s and [[construction]]s, even glass [[trap component]]s. Unique goods made from glass include glass [[window]]s and [[flask|vial]]s, as well as [[Furniture#Furniture_types_with_multiple_names|renamed versions]] of common furniture.
* A glass [[chest]] is called a box.
* A glass [[door]] is called a [[portal]]. 
* A glass [[pipe]] is called a tube.
* A glass [[cage]] is called a terrarium.
* A glass [[flask]] is called a [[vial]].

For more information on the use of glass, see the [[Glass industry]] page.

Raw and cut glass storage options can be found under the Gem [[stockpile]] sub-menu. Glass blocks are stored in Bar/Block stockpiles.

==Glass Block Floors, AKA The Dwarven X-Ray==
In DF Premium's graphical mode, floors made out of glass blocks reveal the z-level directly beneath them and everything on those tiles in real time, even if built on top of a solid cave floor. This exploit can be useful when you want to avoid digging into [[Hidden Fun Stuff]], because even though players can see through glass floors no matter what, entities in the game itself never can.[https://www.reddit.com/r/dwarffortress/comments/10tpcbd/glass_floors_reveal_without_digging/]

==Glass and magma==
Glass behaves somewhat oddly with [[magma]], despite being strictly magma-safe (with a melting point of {{ct|13600}}) – '''built''' glass furniture will survive indefinitely when covered with magma, but '''unbuilt''' glass items tend to disappear instantly when submerged in magma.{{bug|10314}}

==Physical properties==
Through memory hacking, the material properties of each type of glass have been determined; for reference, they have been reconstructed below as material definitions:
