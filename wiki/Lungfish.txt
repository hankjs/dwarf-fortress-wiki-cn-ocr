'''Lungfish''' are a type of aquatic [[vermin]] found in (and next to) [[tropical]] [[river]]s, [[lake]]s, and [[pool]]s year-round, and are a ready source of [[food]] when [[fish cleaning|cleaned]] at a [[fishery]]. Lungfish are amphibious, and so are able to survive and move on land, where they are easy targets for [[cat]]s and other vermin-eating domestic animals.
Their pet value is equal to 0, so they can't be domesticated by an [[Animal trainer]].

Some [[dwarves]] [[Preferences|like]] lungfish for their ''gulping''.

{{D for Dwarf}}

The lungfish is also well known for its playful nature and [http://imgur.com/a/sYJct ability to fly]. Bedazzled dwarves often see these creatures going up and down in the fresh air next to [[river]]s. After conquering water and earth, it is only natural that these terrifying beasts conquer air.

It has been assumed that, soon enough, they will conquer [[magma]] and this day is said to be the day all dwarves will accept lungfish as their new, tiny, amphibious overlords.
