'''Pear''' is one of the many genera of [[tree]]s found above ground. Like the vast majority of above ground trees, pear [[wood]] is brown and produces brown products.

Pear trees can be harvested by dwarves, with the obvious result being pears. Pears can be eaten raw, cooked or brewed into [[alcohol|perry]].

Logs and leaves can be processed in a [[dyer's shop]] into ecru [[dye]].

Some [[Dwarf|dwarves]] [[Preferences|like]] pear trees for their ''fruit''.
