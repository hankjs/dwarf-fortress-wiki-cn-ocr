'''Gorillas''' are large and rare [[creature]]s found in a number of [[tropical]] [[wetland]]s and moist broadleaf [[forest]]s, where they appear in groups of 5-10 individuals. While over twice the [[size]] of the average [[dwarf]], gorillas are benign meanderers who will typically flee if confronted, but may severely injure or even kill civilians if cornered and enraged. Like other species of ape, gorillas are among the few wild animals in the game who aren't innate swimmers, and as such will likely drown if forced into a body of [[water]]. All members of the species are born with Legendary [[skill]] in [[Climber|climbing]].

Gorillas can be captured in [[cage]] [[trap]]s and [[Animal trainer|trained]] into valuable exotic [[pet]]s. Due to their rarity in the wild, consider trying your luck with [[Elf|elven]] caravans, who may occasionally bring tame gorillas for [[trading]]. A trained gorilla doesn't require any [[Grazer|grazing]] and can be further turned into a war or hunting beast, allowing you to put their size to use in your [[military]]. If you manage to obtain a breeding pair of gorillas and decide to breed them, note they take 10 years to reach adulthood (though they are fully grown by the age of 2), considerably longer than most other animals in the game, and likely longer than you'll be willing to wait to turn them into war beasts or livestock.

Some dwarves [[Preferences|like]] gorillas for their ''strength''.
