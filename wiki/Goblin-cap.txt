'''Goblin-caps''' are a type of [[underground]] [[tree]] found in the second and third levels of the [[caverns]] near the [[water]], bearing no relation to [[goblin]]s. When cut down, they yield red logs suitable for producing colorful furniture.

Some [[Dwarf|dwarves]] [[Preferences|like]] goblin-caps for their ''stunning color''.
