'''Worms''' are a species of soil-dwelling [[vermin]] found in the soil of [[taiga]], [[temperate]], and [[tropical]] areas, that can be tamed as [[pet]]s. While they are very common, the combination of the {{token|VERMIN_SOIL|c}} and {{token|VERMIN_NOTRAP|c}} tokens prevents them from being trappable{{verify|based on token descriptions, untested}}.

Some dwarves [[Preferences|like]] worms for their ''wriggling'', but others can "[[Hateable|absolutely detest]] worms" getting [[Thoughts|unhappy thoughts]] when they encounter them.
