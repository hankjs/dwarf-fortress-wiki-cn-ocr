'''Common skates''' are cartilaginous [[Creature#Aquatic|fish]] that can be found in [[temperate]]  and [[tropical]] [[ocean]]s. Nearly twice the size of a [[dwarf]], they provide a good amount of returns if [[butcher]]ed. As fully-sized creatures, they can't be fished by [[Fisherdwarf|fisherdwarves]], but can be caught with a [[drowning chamber]]. An infant common skate is called a ''common skate pup''.

Being cartilaginous, common skates won't give [[bone]]s if butchered (though they'll still provide a [[skull]]).

Some dwarves [[Preferences|like]] common skates for their ''flat bodies''.
