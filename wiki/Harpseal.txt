'''Harp seals''' are carnivorous, amphibious [[Creature|mammals]] located only in [[arctic]] [[ocean]]s. They can sometimes be spotted on shore, in small packs of 3-7 individuals wandering near the coastlines. Harp seals are generally non-aggressive, though they are large, can bite, and they should not be approached by [[armor|unarmored]] [[military]]. In quantity, they make a decent source of [[meat|food]], especially that they happen in packs. Harp seals, however, do not have any special value modifier, so hunting them for profit is not as profitable as in real life. A harp seal infant is called a ''harp seal pup''.

Harp seals can be captured in [[cage]] [[trap]]s and [[Animal trainer|trained]] as [[pet]]s, or as non-grazing livestock for a [[meat industry]]. It takes five years for a harp seal to reach its full size, significantly longer than other, [[Domestic animal|more common]] sources of meat.

Some dwarves [[preference|like]] harp seals for their ''adorable pups''.

== Clubbability ==
{{D for Dwarf}}
Harp seals, and especially baby harp seals, are '''''very''''' clubbable. It is a pity that packs of wild animals do not currently include young, just for the possibility of bashing a wild baby harp seal's skull in. Which is, by the way, a rite of passage for any self-respecting morally ambiguous overseer.

Feel free, however, to catch them wild, and toss them in a place from which they cannot escape. Once the babies are born, send in the macedwarves (no edge weapons allowed) and enjoy your genuine, morally questionable baby seal leather boots! <s>Don't</s> tell the [[Elf|elves]].
