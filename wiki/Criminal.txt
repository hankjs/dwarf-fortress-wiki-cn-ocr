[[File:bandits_preview.png|right]]'''Criminals''' are a profession for some inhabitants of generated [[site]]s, like [[town]]s. These petty criminals are distinct from criminal organization [[boss]]es, and much less dangerous. Some petty criminals show up as [[visitor]]s in [[fortress mode]], and [[agent]]s sometimes try to pose as petty criminals. Petty criminals are [[Unit_type_token#CRIMINAL|shown in dark grey]]. [[Adventure mode]] allows the player character (and/or any companions of theirs) to become a criminal themselves if they so choose.

== Types of criminal groups ==
There are two types of criminal groups within the worlds of ''Dwarf Fortress'': criminal organizations and bandits.

=== Criminal organization ===
[[File:bandit_camp_preview.png|thumb|200px|right|A bandit camp with loot lying around.]]Most [[town]]s have '''criminal organizations''', formed by a collection of outcasts. They are led by a [[boss]], may have lieutenants, and may have a representative who is responsible for trade. Criminal organizations can reside in one of the subterranean structures or [[taverns]]. Their presence underground can be identified by abnormally-large hoards of items piled on the floor. Since the introduction of [[intrigue]], criminal organizations will be part of a number of plots, often corrupting the town officials to embezzle for them, but also participating in theft and plotting assassinations.

They don't tend to harm anyone, even when encountering them in their base, but members will spit at you and pour out their hatred on you, if you are a [[hearthperson]].

Criminal organizations are the targets of certain quests, and should not be confused with bandits. [[Intrigue]]-wise, members of criminal organizations have their fingers in many different pies, plotting assassinations, thefts and corrupting various officials for funds. Extra care needs to be taken when having altercations with members of these organizations, as they tend to be members of several different groups within a town. You as an adventurer might feel that you are delighting the lord by telling them you got rid of their local mafia, but all they will hear is you bragging about murdering valuable civilians, and will thus know you as a [[reputation|murderer]].

=== Bandits ===
[[File:bandit_master_preview.png|thumb|250px|right|A bandit leader, with an appropriate amount of lovers and children ratio.]]Bandits are run by a [[boss]] and consist of various brigands and outlaws on the fringes of [[civilization]]. Their inhabitants are drawn from a parent civilization with the BANDITRY token. If the parent civilization also has the LOCAL_BANDITRY token, a bandit group's members can be found [[ambush]]ing adventurers and raiding nearby [[town]]s, instead of just loitering around the home camp. They can also lay [[siege]]s of sorts to one's [[fortress]].

Bandits have two subtypes: '''nomadic bandits''', and '''fort bandits'''.

'''Nomadic bandits''' may wander the wilderness, live in [[camp]]s, or inhabit abandoned sites, such as [[fortress]]es, [[fort]]s, [[cave]]s, and the like. Such camps, themselves, lack any [[building]]s or signs of habitation, except for the occasional [[campfire]] and pile of loot.
 
'''Fort bandits''' are a little more organized, as evidenced by the fact they build [[fort]]s. Because the game sees these folk as being the site government of their fort, these bandits will also create positions such as 'head chef' or 'master of beasts'.

[[Necromancer]]s can also form bandit groups, headquartered in a [[Tower (necromancy)|tower]].

Bandits very often have their values or [[ethics]] clash with members of civilized society. This means that if your adventurer is part of civilized society, they will be automatically attacked by bandits. You can avoid this by either creating an outsider adventurer, who has no ties to the existing entities, or by assuming a compatible [[Reputation#Controlling_your_reputation|identity]]. If the bandits don't automatically try to murder your character, and your reputation is formidable enough, you can even ask to join them, and ask for [[quest]]s.

Killing bandits in adventure mode will give you a [[reputation]] as "protector of the weak".{{version|0.42.01}} Unlike criminal organizations, bandits are considered murderous scum, and thus most folk appreciate you getting rid of them.

==Trivia==
*If your reputation becomes exceptionally high ("Famous Hero", so above 75), bandits trying to ambush you will say "Ha-ha-halt!" instead of the normal announcement message, presumably stammering in front of such a fearsome figure. An exception is if they have {{token|NOFEAR}}.
