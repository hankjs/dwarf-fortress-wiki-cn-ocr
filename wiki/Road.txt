[[File:paved_road_v50_preview.png|thumb|169px|right|A mudstone paved road.]]A '''road''' is a construction that paves over a large section of flat terrain. Roads are most commonly used to give [[caravan|caravans]] a reliable path to your fortress from the map's edge.  They are not strictly necessary, as a wagon is entirely capable of making its way over dirt or grass provided a 3-wide path exists the entire way; but without a road, you run the risk of trees growing in positions that prevent a wagon from squeezing through. A dwarf with the [[road building]] labor must haul any materials to the site and construct the road.

'''Dirt roads''' ({{menu icon|b|n|O}}) can be constructed for free on any soil, removing mud and other contaminants and also [[shrub]]s and [[tree]]s, as well as preventing new ones from growing. However, they wear away over time, and have to be reconstructed periodically - depending on the size of the road, this can be a hassle.

'''Paved roads''' ({{menu icon|b|n|o}}) can be constructed with any building material, including [[stone]], [[block]]s, [[wood]] and metal [[bar]]s. These roads are permanent, and use less material than paving the same space with constructed [[floor]]s - yet a paved road is a building, not a construction. To avoid the hassle of long-distance hauling, it is advisable to place a [[stockpile]] near the desired site for your builder to get materials from. Broken bolts do not show up on tiles with paved roads, so paving your archery ranges can keep them looking neat.  The number of units of material needed to construct a road is given by the number of tiles the road will cover divided by four, plus one: (Tiles / 4) + 1. The material of the road is the material of the oldest item used in building it.

Paved roads cannot be built over water (except 'Brooks'). They can, however, be built on top of 'Ice Walls' (i.e. frozen water), but will fully deconstruct themselves if the Ice Walls they're built on thaw out. A simple work-around is to build constructed floors ({{menu icon|b|n|f}}) over the water, which you can (but don't have to) then pave over. Alternatively, a [[bridge]] can be used instead of a road, providing the body of water is no more than 20 tiles across.

Building with stone blocks instead of natural stone results in Smooth paved roads instead of Rough paved roads. If there's a mix, it defaults to rough.

== World gen roads ==
During [[world generation]], roads are created connecting [[human]] towns and [[dwarf]] mountainhomes.  Dwarven and Goblin civilizations also create underground roads connecting their sites, which can be discovered in caverns after embark, or entered from above ground in adventure mode.  World gen roads can consist of unpaved dirt or be made of [[construction|constructed]] [[floor]]s (made from [[stone]] [[block]]s), and are not the same as player-constructed roads. Also, dirt roads are upgraded to paved roads after connecting 2+ cities of population 1000+ that are within a few market links of each other.

{{D for Dwarf}}
The hypothesis that roads "go ever on and on" has been tested and decisively falsified. Most roads end after running through at most a dozen sites.
