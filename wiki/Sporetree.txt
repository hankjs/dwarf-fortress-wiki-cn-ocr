'''Spore trees''' are a type of [[underground]] [[tree]] found in the deep [[cavern]]s, and grow on [[mud|muddied]] [[soil]] after they are found. When cut down, they yield teal logs suitable for producing colorful furniture.

Some [[Dwarf|dwarves]] [[Preferences|like]] spore trees for their ''raining spores''.
