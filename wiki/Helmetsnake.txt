'''Helmet snakes''' are [[creature]]s who inhabit the first and second layers of the [[cavern]]s. They spawn individually and slither through the underground, attacking anything smaller than themselves; they continuously grow throughout their entire lives, with the oldest snakes being nearly as heavy as a fully grown [[dwarf]], and they may attempt to take a bite out of one if provoked. Helmet snakes are distinctive for their extremely potent [[Syndrome|venom]], which causes nausea, bruising, bleeding, fever, dizziness, swelling, oozing and even necrosis on those it bites{{cite talk|v0.34 talk:Helmet snake#Bite symptoms}}. Without proper protection, a helmet snake can very easily kill a dwarf.

Helmet snakes can be captured in [[cage]] [[trap]]s and [[Animal trainer|trained]] into [[pet]]s. They are born adults and can't be rendered fully tame. A female trained snake can be placed in a [[nest box]], where she'll lay a large amount of [[egg]]s, or either gender can be [[butcher]]ed for a significant amount of returns (note the returns noted to the right represent a fully grown snake, younger ones will yield less). Products made from helmet snake parts are [[Item value|worth]] twice more than those made from common domestic animals. You may also try and use them for [[fortress defense]] - you can very easily cripple a [[goblin]] if your snake hits a bite attack, though the invader's armor and dodging skills may help them shrug it off, in addition to putting your pet in mortal danger. 

You can sometimes get helmet snakes by raiding sites occupied by kobolds.

Unlike most creatures, helmet snakes can't be spawned in the [[object testing arena]].

Some dwarves [[Preferences|like]] helmet snakes for their ''impressive heads''.

Some immature male [[human]]s have jokingly used the creature's name to describe a part of their own anatomy.
