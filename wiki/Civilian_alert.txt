[[File:Dfhack_civ_alert.png|thumb|175 px|DFHack-added panel for managing civilian alerts]]

A '''civilian alert''' was a [[military]] alert that confined all civilians (and animals) to a specific set of [[burrow]]s.

The current version of Vanilla Dwarf Fortress does not provide an interface for managing civilian alerts, however the underlying functionality ''is'' still present and perfectly usable. [[DFHack]] exposes a single civilian alert state via the '''gui/civ-alert''' tool (on by default in Premium version), with the [[burrow]]s being configurable from a button which appears when the {{menu icon|q}} [[Squad]] menu is opened.
