'''Altars''' are a [[furniture]] item used in [[temple]]s.  In fortress mode, altars can be made from most materials like wood, stone, glass, and metal at their respective [[workshop]]s. They can be built with {{Menu icon|b|f|p}} and are labelled as '''Offering Places''', though they currently serve no purpose other than increasing a [[Zone#Quality_and_value|room's value]] and decoration, as [[temple]]s don't require them to function. Altars can be stored in furniture [[stockpile]]s, and fall in the "other large tools" item type category.

Altars are extremely lightweight compared to other "furniture" (1/20 to 1/60 the weight), and so make excellent trade items to produce.

Dwarves have been known to place [[skull]]s on altars. In [[adventure mode]], you can often find [[dice]] that can be rolled on altars.

A dwarf that knocks over an altar within a dedicated temple, during a tantrum or otherwise, will be cursed by that temple's deity with a random were-curse (as long as they are a believer of that deity). There is no cure. The player will receive a pop-up notification stating that the god has cursed their dwarf, and that dwarf will transform into a hostile beast during [[Werebeast#Full_Moons_.2F_Transformation_dates|the next full moon]].
