'''Giant coatis''' are [[giant animal]] counterparts to [[coati]]s, who can be found in [[savage]] [[tropical]] and [[temperate]] [[forests]]. Like their smaller cousins, they may steal [[Steals items|items]] and [[Steals food|foo]] from the fortress if given an opportunity and will take any item they can get their paws on, and being four times the size of a [[dwarf]] means they are more than capable of defending themselves in a fight against unarmed civilians. They are best [[Ambusher|hunted]] or [[Cage trap|baited]] and killed before they get away with something useful.

Giant coatis can be captured in cage traps and trained into exotic [[pets]], possessing the default giant animal value. They give a decent amount of returns when butchered but are difficult to breed due to their solitary nature. Like all giant animals, they are considered exotic [[mount]]s.

Some dwarves [[Preferences|like]] giant coatis for their ''curiosity''.
