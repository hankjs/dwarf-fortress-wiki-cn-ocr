'''Cave moss''' is an underground floor-covering plant (or maybe fungus), growing natively in the second [[cavern]] layer. As it is functionally a [[grass]], [[grazer]]s may feed on it.

As with [[Caverns#Benefits|the other underground grasses]], cave moss only appears after a [[cavern]] containing it has been discovered. After that has happened, it may spread on any below ground [[soil]] surface or on a muddied stone surface that has not been smoothed. The amount of mud on the surface does not affect the distribution or growth rate of subterranean plants [http://www.bay12forums.com/smf/index.php?topic=122150].

While it might appear [[plump helmet|various]] [[sweet pod|types]] [[cave wheat|of]] [[dimple cup|fungi]] grow from the cave moss, this is really just that they too grow on the same muddy floor.
