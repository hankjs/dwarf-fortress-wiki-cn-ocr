[[File:Sites preview.png|right]]
'''Sites''' are inhabited locations found on region tiles adjacent to at least one non-mountain land [[biome]]. These include settlements of any civilization, and caves habitable by named creatures. The type of site will be represented on maps in any mode with a tile that replaces the region tile. In adventure mode, the site becomes the default arrival location for travel to that region tile. Sites acquire a history that can be viewed in [[Legends mode]].

== Detailed Description ==
Sites are grouped by [[civilization]]s, which are organized groups of creatures (generally of the same race) which build these sites.

<h3 style="background: #eaecf0;"> Human sites </h3>

==== Towns [[File:Icon site city 1.png]]  [[File:Icon site city 2.png]] [[File:Icon site city 3.png]] [[File:Icon site city 4.png]] / {{Raw Tile|+|7:0:0}} {{Raw Tile|*|7:0:0}} {{Raw Tile|#|7:0:0}} {{Raw Tile|☼|7:0:1}} ====
:Humans live in towns comprised of buildings and often a paved road.  Human towns are highly modular, and are usually near some source of water, either the coast or a river. Towns appear on the fast travel map (when outside a site) as {{Tile|■|7:0:1}} or {{Tile|■|6:0:1}} symbols, which are small collections of buildings. When you are near a human site, large yellow blocks indicate where various houses and shops are found (though not all houses and shops can be found in these blocks; sometimes you'll find a house or two out in a site's fields). You usually have to follow the roads in a yellow block on the fast travel map. Towns usually have lots of interesting structures which are described fully in the [[town]] article.

==== Hamlets [[File:Icon site village.png]] / {{Raw Tile|æ|2:0:0}} {{Raw Tile|Æ|2:0:0}} {{Raw Tile|{{=}}|2:0:0}} {{Raw Tile|≡|2:0:0}} ====
:Most of the time, the majority of a human civilization's population will live in small [[hamlet]]s, which tend to be sprawled out along coastlines and through river valleys. Like other sites, they can be invaded, and you'll sometimes find them captured by other civilizations, [[necromancer]]s, or criminal syndicates. Human adventurers usually spawn in hamlets. Note that hamlets are similar in structure to towns, only they have mead halls instead of keeps, and don't have any defensive walls.

<h3 style="background: #eaecf0;"> Dwarven sites </h3>

==== Dwarf fortresses [[File:Icon site mountainhome.png]] / {{Raw Tile|Ω|7:0:1}} ====
:These are the randomly generated equivalent of the sites you build in [[fortress mode]]. [[Fortress]]es are described in detail in their own article. Their main function for adventurers is that they have a central, spiraling ramp that connects the underground and above-ground worlds, particularly in that they connect the subterranean tunnel networks to the rest of the dwarf civilization. They are located at the edges of mountain ranges. Player-made fortresses are considered dwarf fortresses by the game, in addition to the randomly-generated ones.

==== Mountain halls [[File:Icon site fortress.png]] / {{Raw Tile|Ω|0:0:1}} ====
:[[Mountain halls]] are the sites of the "deep dwarves," located far beneath the mountains. They can be accessed via down-stairs found in underground tunnels, and are comprised of a couple of levels that contain bedrooms and large halls filled with smelters or forges.

==== Hillocks [[File:Icon site hillocks.png]] / {{Raw Tile|Ω|7:0:0}} ====
:[[Hillocks]] are the dwarf equivalent to human hamlets. They consist of a few circular mounds, filled with dwarf citizens. There doesn't seem to be any settlement pattern for them; they are equally likely to be found in any land [[biome]].

<h3 style="background: #eaecf0;"> Elven sites </h3>

==== Forest retreats [[File:icon_site_ruin_forest_retreat1.png]] [[File:icon_site_ruin_forest_retreat2.png]] / {{Raw Tile|î|6:0:1}} {{Raw Tile|¶|6:0:1}} ====
:Elves live in [[forest retreat]]s located, unsurprisingly, in [[forest]] biomes. They are essentially clusters of huge [[tree]]s with elves standing in and around them.

<h3 style="background: #eaecf0;"> Goblin sites </h3>

==== Dark fortresses [[File:Icon site dark fortress b.png]] [[File:Icon site dark fortress 1.png]] [[File:Icon site dark fortress 3.png]] / {{Raw Tile|π|0:0:1}} {{Raw Tile|π|5:0:1}} ====
:These are the main goblin sites. [[Dark fortress]]es might contain a [[underworld spire|certain spoiler]].

==== Dark pits [[File:Icon site dark fortress 2.png]] / {{Raw Tile|º|5:0:0}}====
:These are the goblin equivalent of [[hamlet]]s and [[hillock]]s. [[Dark pits]] are essentially canyons lined with wooden guard towers. They tend to be built in huge clusters around the dark fortresses, such that large chunks of the map may be covered with them.{{verify}}

<h3 style="background: #eaecf0;"> Kobold sites </h3>
==== Caves [[File:Icon site cave.png]] / {{Raw Tile|•|0:0:1}}====
:[[Cave]]s are sometimes home to [[kobold]] groups. They are mounds filled with narrow tunnels leading to the [[caverns]] and usually contain piles of random loot resulting from kobold [[Thief|thieving]] incursions. Kobold caves often feature venom-coated traps or [[fun]] pets such as giant cave spiders, so beware. Some caves are inhabited by [[bandit]]s or [[megabeast]]s instead.

<h3 style="background: #eaecf0;"> Beast and night creature sites </h3>

==== Necromancers' towers [[File:Icon site necrotower.png]] / {{Raw Tile|I|5:0:0}} ====
:[[Necromancer]]s' towers are built by necromancers who have at least 50 followers; younger necromancers may take over towns or camps instead. Usually you can find [[book]]s written by the necromancer, some of which contain [[Necromancer#Adventurer_Mode|the secret to life and death]]. Towers require abundant human populations (low savagery, large tracts of neutral land) and a high number of secrets to be generated in world generation. Necromancers will rarely be elves or goblins, because elves and goblins are immortal (they lack a {{token|MAXAGE|c}} token) and therefore can't be obsessed with their own mortality. However, they may still acquire the secrets of life and death by reading them (e.g. in a necromancy [[book]] from your [[library]]) and gain the ability to raise corpses.

==== Lairs [[File:Icon site lair burrow.png]] / {{Raw Tile|•|0:0:1}}====
:[[Lair]]s are the homes of [[animal|predatory animals]], [[megabeast]]s, or [[night troll]]s. Lairs are mounds or holes in the ground. Night troll lairs have [[door]]s or [[hatch cover]]s. Most lairs are inhabited by a single creature, but sometimes you'll encounter entire families of them.

==== [[Minotaur]]s' labyrinths [[File:Icon site labyrinth.png]] / {{Raw Tile|#|0:7:0}}====
:A [[labyrinth]] is an intricate network of tunnels, often filled with the bodies of previous adventurers slain in [[World generation|worldgen]] by its resident [[minotaur]]. Each labyrinth contains a hidden chamber filled with treasures. As you explore the labyrinth, you will hear the minotaur taunting you.

==== Shrines [[File:Icon site shrine titan.png]] [[File:icon_site_fort2.png]] / {{Raw Tile|Å|7:0:0}} ====
:[[Shrine (megabeast)|Shrine]]s are huge stone structures surrounded by pillars that are the homes of [[Bronze colossus|bronze colossuses]] and [[titan]]s. Several of them can be found on a single site, making its exploration particularly hazardous. [[Clowns|Clowns]] have also been reported to inhabit them.

== Dwarf Fortresses ==
During the embark phase of Fortress Mode, sites can be seen in region and local views. Some site types can be included in the embark region; namely caves or previous player fortresses (Reclaim).  Embarking on settlements is disabled.  On embarking, the fortress becomes a site of the size and location chosen.

Abandoned fortresses are displayed on the map as Ruins.
