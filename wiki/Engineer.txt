'''Engineer''' is a category profession.  It contains skills relating to the construction and operation of [[Mechanism|mechanisms]] and [[Machine component|machinery]], including [[Siege engine|siege engines]].

An adult [[Dwarf|dwarf]] whose best [[Skill|skill]] is in this category, and who has accumulated ranks in other engineering skills (exactly how much is not clear) will be known as an Engineer, or once they have achieved 'grand master' skill in one of these skills, but not in the others.

If a dwarf has [[Experience|experience]] in only one engineer skill, they will be known by their highest skill.

The engineering skills are:

{{Skill Box|Engineer|4:1|4:1|
* [[Mechanic]]
* [[Pump operator]]
* [[Siege engineer]]
* [[Siege operator]]
}}

The [[optics engineer]]ing and [[fluid engineer]]ing skills don't count as engineering skills, but contribute to the Engineer title regardless and are taught in the respective guildhall alongside [[Student]] skill.

{{D for Dwarf}}
It is well known that Engineers have the lowest propensity for dishonesty.
