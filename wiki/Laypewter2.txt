'''Lay pewter''' is an [[alloy]] that can created from [[bar]]s of metal, at a [[smelter]], using the following recipe:

*2 [[Tin]] [[bar]]s + 1 [[Copper]] bar + 1 [[Lead]] bar

Unlike [[trifle pewter]] and [[fine pewter]], lay pewter ''cannot'' be smelted directly from [[ore]].

Lay pewter has a base value of 3, which would make it preferable over its ingredient metals for creating objects of [[value]], since all of its ingredients have a value of only 2.  However, with the same ingredients (in a different formula) you get more value from making [[trifle pewter]] or, better still, [[bronze]] or [[fine pewter]], and using lead as-is (separately). 

When using classic ASCII graphics, lay pewter is notable for producing [[bar]]s, [[furniture]] and [[crafts]] that appear in-game as teal-colored, a color shared only by [[clear glass]] and [[spore tree]] wood.

Technically ''(i.e. "in real life")'', lay pewter is [[trifle pewter]] that has been cut with [[lead]]; it is less valuable, but you get more of it.
