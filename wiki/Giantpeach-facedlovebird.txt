'''Giant peach-faced lovebirds''' will fly around your fortress site, occasionally landing on trees to roost. They can be captured and tamed as a pet or an [[egg]]-laying machine. They have a sizable pet value of 500, like many giant creatures. In a desperate situation (or an unintended one, as your hunter might find it amusing if an expensive bolt got lodged in its head) they can also be used as sources of meat, bones and lard.

==Combat==

Due to their size, giant peach-faced lovebirds can cause significant damage to unarmed, inexperienced dwarves, often leading them to bleed to death. In evenly-matched combat against civilian dwarves, giant peach-faced lovebirds usually win, frequently without any losses. Therefore, armed and experienced dwarves are recommended to encourage giant peach-faced lovebirds to flock elsewhere. Humorously, some dwarves [[preference|like]] giant peach-faced lovebirds for their ''loving nature''.
Taming these creatures can be very beneficial to your fortress' defense, considering how dangerous they are.

Just remember, as they peck out the eyes of your only woodcutter or fisherman, they're doing it for love.
It's been found that historically, many victims of Giant Peach-Faced Lovebirds happen to immediately stop upon hearing the name "Giant Peach-Faced Love Bird", and have been known to cause supremely dangerous and viscous deaths. 

Incidentally, for those who happen to be inclined to own them as pets, be aware that not only has their scale been increased, but so has the volume of their shrieking calls.
