[[File:Night creature priest holy hell.png|thumb|right|A humanoid [[experiment]] identified as a high priest.]]A '''priest''' is a religious leader that can perform rituals related to that religion.

==Adventurer mode==
Priests appear in many [[human]] and [[goblin]] settlements, even those captured by and incorporated into civilizations of other races. They will either worship the civilization's official object of worship, or one aligned with the civilization's pantheon or [[sphere]].

High priests are the leaders of the local [[religion|religious sect]] and have distinct, idiosyncratic, yet [[Language#language_SYM.txt|thematic]] titles, such as "High Dessert" or "Sacred Oil". If no high priest resides in the settlement, any priests present, and most citizens, will be members of a neighboring religious sect. High priests in goblin fortresses are likely to be goblins, even if the rest of the population is supplanted by other races.

If a [[temple]] is in the settlement, there will be a local sect, and a living high priest, at least at the end of worldgen. Priests will be found wandering inside during the day, though in human towns, some may wander to visit a local tavern, mead hall, or keep, many return to their homes for lunch, and some may work as shopkeepers. In such towns, priests will also return home to sleep, while, in goblin fortresses, priests will sleep within the temple. 
If one selected the path of a Chosen during character creation, their deity will direct them to their nearest sect's high priest to give the player their quest, referring to them as their "representative".

==Fortress mode==

After more than ten worshipers of a given [[religion|religious organization]] reside in your fort, they may demand the establishment of a [[temple]] to their deity. Once that temple has been erected and its minimum wealth requirements met, you will have the opportunity to appoint a priest from among their members, and a high priest once the temple has met the requirements for a temple complex. Priests are able to console upset followers and give inspiring sermons.

When meeting the requirements of 10 followers and temple value of 2000, priesthood is recognized. You can then select a priest from the members of the organization, who is given a thematic title. When meeting the requirements of 25 followers and temple value of 10000, the high priesthood of the religion is recognized - your current priest will be promoted, and you can select another follower as a priest.

These numbers can vary with or be customized in [[Difficulty#Temples|difficulty settings]].

There can only be one priest and one high priest per organization in your fortress, even when assigning multiple different temples to the same organization. Priests may be among the participants of [[ambush]]es and [[siege]]s.

Priests help in maintaining [[stress]] by holding sermons at their temple, and by being cried at by unhappy members of their religion.
