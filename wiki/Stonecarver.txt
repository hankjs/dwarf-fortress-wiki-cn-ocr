'''Stone Carver''' is the skill associated with the '''Stone Carving''' [[labor]]. Stone carvers are responsible for creating [[furniture]] and other objects out of [[stone]] in a [[stoneworker's workshop]]. A stone carver's skill level affects the speed and [[quality]] of his work.

Many veteran players consider it worth bringing a skilled Stone Carver on embark, as they can quickly make [[quality]] [[table]]s, [[chair]]s, [[door]]s, [[Hatch cover|hatches]] and other stone furniture that you want early to keep your dwarves safe and happy. Note that not all furniture can be made of stone; significantly, [[bed]]s can ''only'' be made of [[wood]].

Graphically, stone carvers will wear all white clothes.

Note that Stone Carvers are distinct from both [[Stonecutter|Stone<u>cutters</u>]] and [[Stonecrafter|Stone<u>crafters</u>]]. The former, 'Cutters, can change <u>un</u>mined stone surfaces into several useful shapes for your fortress, and also can use a stoneworker's workshop to make stone [[block]]s, while the latter, 'Crafters, work at a [[craftdwarf's workshop]] and generally create household items, [[trade]] goods or [[decoration]]s out of stone.
