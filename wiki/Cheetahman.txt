'''Cheetah men''' are [[animal people]] variants of the common [[cheetah]] who can be found in [[savage]] [[tropical]] grasslands, spawning in groups of 1-5 individuals, and are not too aggressive, but may pick fights with dwarves who get too close. Much like their animal cousins, cheetah men are fast, running at 40 km/h, making them one of the fastest animal people on land. They are exactly the same size as [[dwarves]].

Like other savage animal people, they can join [[civilization]]s, become [[historical figure]]s, appear as [[visitor]]s and be playable in [[adventurer mode]].

Some dwarves [[preference|like]] cheetah men for their ''speed''.

<!-- Reference: "The Cheetahmen" mascots for infamous "Action 52" video game -->
Cheetah men were originally going to be explicitly excluded from the game due to the fear of resurrecting [[wikipedia:The Cheetahmen|ancient glitches]]. Unfortunately, the [[elf|elves]] insisted that all animals deserve their due representation, and secretly let them in. Today, it is speculated that this was the root cause of all glitches to ever be encountered within the game's worlds. Sweet [[Armok]], we tried to stop it. But now, it is too late.

Additionally, Cheetah Men have no relation to any edible puffed cornmeal cheese products.
