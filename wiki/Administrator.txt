'''Administrator''' is a categorical [[profession]]. [[Skill]]s that fall into this category have to do with fortress administration and oversight. The profession is special in that administrator skills are practiced by appointed [[Noble|positions]] instead of as labors. The organizer skill is also used during [[military]] [[training]].

Dwarves whose highest skill falls into this category are known as administrators, except for those who have achieved Grand Master or higher, whose profession is renamed to their skill. 
Dwarves with more than one grand master skill in this area are again renamed to administrators. Appointed positions override skill names, so practicing administrators are named [[broker]]s, [[bookkeeper]]s, and [[manager]]s, not administrators.

The Administrator skills are:

{{Skill Box|Administrator|5:0|5:0|
* [[Appraiser]]
* [[Organizer]]
* [[Record keeper]]}}
