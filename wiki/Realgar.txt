'''Realgar''' is a brilliant red [[stone]] (neither [[fire-safe]] nor [[magma-safe]]) found as small clusters in [[igneous extrusive]] layers. 
== In real life ==
Realgar is very soft. Being an arsenic sulfide (like [[orpiment]]), it is also an extremely toxic substance. It was used in painting for its unique orange colour, but fell out of use because of the health hazards. It poses no such health hazards to dwarves, however, who will readily (and safely) use it as a normal stone, including for the production of food containers and mechanisms.

Realgar is the opposite of Fakegar, and is much more useful.
