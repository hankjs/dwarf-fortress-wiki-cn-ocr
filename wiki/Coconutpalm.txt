'''Coconut palms''' are a type of [[above ground]] [[tree]], that can be found in dry areas of any [[tropical]] biome. Like the overwhelming majority of overland trees, palm [[carpenter|wood]] is brown and produces brown products.

Coconut palms produce coconuts that can be harvested by setting up a gathering [[zone]]. Coconuts are edible raw or cooked, but cannot be brewed. Unlike most other fruit trees, coconuts do not have seeds (technically, the edible part of the coconut is the seed and the fruit itself is inedible, but it isn't set as such in the raws, and dwarves still eat the entire fruit).

Some [[Dwarf|dwarves]] [[Preferences|like]] coconut palms for their ''leaves''.

There is often confusion over if the coconut nut is a big big nut or a coco fruit. <br>
Coconut palm [[wood]] is preferably used for building big [[house|houses]] for [[Relationship|families]].
