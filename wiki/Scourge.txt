[[File:scourge_sprite_preview.png|right]]A '''scourge''' is an [[attack types|edge]] [[weapon]] that consists of a spike or bladed weight on the end of a flexible length of [[material]] that can be swung at high speed. Scourges have low contact area and high velocity, making them effective even against [[armor]]ed opponents, [[Wear|shredding]] armor, flesh and bone. Scourges are similar to [[whip]]s, though the whip is a blunt weapon with an even smaller contact area.

Scourges use and train the [[lasher]] skill. As foreign weapons, dwarves cannot [[forge]] scourges, limiting supply to whatever low-[[quality]] specimens can be scavenged from [[goblin]] invaders. [[Weapon#Size|Even the smallest dwarves]] can equip a scourge one-handed.
