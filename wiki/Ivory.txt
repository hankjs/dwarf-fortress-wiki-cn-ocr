[[File:ivory_preview.png|right]]'''Ivory''' and '''teeth'''  are resources used to create or decorate crafts at the [[craftsdwarf's workshop]] with the [[Bone carver|bone carving]] [[skill]]. The exact material category is "ivory/tooth", signifying that either ivory (the tusks of large animals) or sufficiently large teeth are needed for the job.

Ivory tusks are obtained from [[butcher]]ing certain [[Creature|animals]] at the [[butcher's shop]]: [[elephant]]s, [[hippo]]s, [[narwhal]]s, [[walrus]]es, [[warthog]]s, and [[wild boar]]s. Some intelligent creatures like [[troll]]s and [[gorlak]]s also have tusks, but dwarves will not butcher them.

Usable teeth may be harvested by butchering many of the largest animals (roughly [[grizzly bear]]-size or larger). Although [[combat]] may knock teeth loose from the mouths of dwarves, animals and invaders, such knocked-out teeth are almost always too small for crafting. As a rule, if a creature does not drop teeth or ivory when butchered, its teeth are too small for crafting, especially when divided into 30 pieces.

[[Goblin]]s will often wear [[jewelry]] made of troll ivory. Dwarves (and others) may carry "trophies" made from otherwise uncraftable materials (e.g. an elf tooth amulet).
