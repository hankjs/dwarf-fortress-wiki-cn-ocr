'''Giant jackals''' are the [[giant animal|giant]] cousin of the [[jackal]], appearing very rarely in [[savage]] tropical [[shrubland]]s, [[grassland]]s and [[savanna]]s, in packs of 1-5 individuals. Giant jackals are more than 20 times the size of normal ones, the size of an [[elk]] or a [[donkey]], and thus a minor threat to your dwarves. Armored militia should be able to take them down with relative ease, though. If you've ever dealt with [[giant dingo]]s, giant jackals are both slightly smaller than these, and come in smaller packs.   

Products made from giant jackal parts are [[Item value|worth]] twice more than those made from common animals.

Giant jackals are exotic [[mount]]s, and may as such appear in [[elf|elven]] [[siege]]s.

Some dwarves [[Preferences|like]] giant jackals for their ''resourceful nature''.
