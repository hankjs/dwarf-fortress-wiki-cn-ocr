A '''champion''' is an appointed [[noble]] position, which becomes available after a fortress becomes a [[baron]]y. They have no [[Zone|room]] requirements. The Champion is akin to a cultural champion, that promotes the values of their [[civilization]], and seeks to encourage the denizens of the fort.

The Champion does not perform menial labors, instead merely standing in meeting areas (with a job description of "Noble") and talking to anyone nearby. Dwarves who speak to the Champion will get a special [[thought]] about "talking to a pillar of society", with the happiness bonus or penalty depending on the dwarf's [[Personality value#TRADITION|opinions on tradition]], and they will also satisfy their [[need]] to "uphold tradition".
