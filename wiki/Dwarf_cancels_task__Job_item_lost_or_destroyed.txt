{{DFtext|Dwarf cancels task: Job item lost or destroyed.}}

A dwarf whose tasked item is no longer in the same tile as when their job was assigned will cancel the job with this message. Often, the "missing" item will be a scant few tiles away, and the job can be reissued referencing its new location. Occasionally, the item will have '''actually''' been destroyed (possibly as the result of a [[cave-in]] or [[Dwarven atom smasher|atom smashing]]).

While dwarves [[Main:Dwarf cancels Construct Building: Item blocking site|will not directly move tasked items]], they may ''indirectly'' move them (such as by [[channel]]ing out the floor underneath the item, disassembling a [[building]] containing the item, or removing the [[construction]] beneath the item). Items may also be moved by natural forces such as [[cave-in]]s and [[flow]]ing liquids, or by one of the many thieving creatures in ''Dwarf Fortress''.

This error may also occur if the tasked item changes state--such as a [[leather|raw hide]] becoming [[rot]]ten, or an [[ice]] boulder melting.
