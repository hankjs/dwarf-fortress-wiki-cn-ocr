'''Olive''' is one of the many genera of [[tree]]s found above ground. Like the vast majority of above ground trees, olive [[wood]] is brown and produces brown products. Logs and leaves can be processed in a [[dyer's shop]] into woodland green [[dye]].

Olive trees possess the third densest wood and the densest wood that isn't restricted to evil biomes or the deep caverns. This density makes olive wood a less optimal choice as a material for [[bin]]s and other goods that need to be hauled regularly. Elves armed with olive wood [[arrow]]s and [[weapon]]s are slightly more dangerous to civilian dwarves than those made from other types of wood.

Olive fruit can be eaten raw, or can be pressed into olive [[oil]] and a unit of [[press cake|olive pomace]] at a [[screw press]].  Olives can be harvested by setting up a gathering [[zone]].

Olive oil is much easier to produce than [[seed]] oils, as not only do olives not need to be [[milling|milled]] first, but a stack of them can also be [[pressing|pressed]] in a single job, occupying only one [[jug]].  On the other hand, compared to seeds, there's less [[value]] increase, and your supply of olives is limited to whatever you can [[herbalist|gather]] or [[trading|import]], whereas seeds are an often plentiful byproduct of [[farming]], which is infinitely scalable.

Some [[Dwarf|dwarves]] [[Preferences|like]] olive trees for their ''oil-giving fruit''.
