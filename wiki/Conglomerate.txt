'''Conglomerate''' is one of many [[sedimentary layer]] [[stone]]s. It is notable for not only supporting [[aquifer]]s, but also frequently containing large [[cluster]]s of [[puddingstone]] which will '''also''' support the aquifer.

==In Real Life==
Conglomerate is a type of clastic sedimentary stone composed of large, well rounded grains, at least 2 millimeters in diameter; if the grains are angular, it is called a breccia (which is not present in ''Dwarf Fortress''). If the grains are rounded pebbles, the conglomerate is called [[puddingstone]].
