[[File:steam_preview_anim.gif|right]]'''Steam''' is the result of boiling [[water]].  This is distinct from [[mist]], a similar-looking product of water falling, or [[smoke]].  [[Rain]] falling on a pool of [[magma]] may cause steam, as will magma boiling off water that is covering something that is [[magma safe]] (like an obsidian stone).  Magma is the most common source of the temperatures needed to boil water, but some burning items may create steam when submerged, as may some creatures with very high body [[temperature]].

Steam is visibly harmless in the current version. [[Forgotten beast]]s are sometimes generated to be composed of steam, and these creatures are far from harmless, though they are exceedingly fragile due to the material properties of steam. Some of these beasts may also have the ability to exhaust steam as a way of attacking, where it can be called "boiling extract".

Another product of water and magma mixing is [[obsidian]].

It has been reported that steam can be produced from rain falling on the blood of a forgotten beast that possesses the [[fire]] breathing ability.

To build a continuous steam generator, build a magma-safe bridge over a [[magma flow]].  Connect a space containing the bridge to an ample reservoir of magma, and allow water to fall on it from above.  This will produce a continuous cloud of steam that spreads throughout surrounding squares.
