A [[swimming pool]] is a chamber filled with less than 7/7 deep [[water]]. Its design can be similar to that of a [[drowning chamber]], except you want to use it on your own dwarves - to teach them to [[Swimmer|swim]].

A dwarf in the water will gain the ability to swim very fast - sadly, not fast enough to prevent death from [[drowning]]. While water with a depth of 7/7 is deadly for non-swimmers, you can safely use water at depths from 4/7 to 6/7 to teach dwarves how to swim without risk of drowning. The speed of learning is independent of the depth, but water with a depth of less than 4/7 is not deep enough to make a dwarf swim, and therefore learn anything.

Training your dwarves just requires a place of constant or temporary 4/7 to 6/7 depth water. [[Military]] orders or making rooms a [[meeting hall]] will not entice dwarves into the water, so you may need to prevent them from leaving an area (by [[Door#usage|locking the door]], for example) and then fill the area with the required amount of water, or dump them in from above using a [[bridge|retracting bridge]].

Swimming, since it involves no activity, can be potentially useful to train weaker, disabled or injured dwarves, whose conditions might go away or become manageable with an [[attribute]] boost to strength, endurance, willpower, etc.

A fully automated method to train idlers is to use water flowing over a 1-[[Z-level]] drop, with a 1-wide meeting zone at the top of the ledge, and a swimming pool at the bottom. Idlers will go to the meeting zone, be swept over the side into the pool and swim to the [[ramp]], and repeat this for as long as they are idle. The meeting zone must have a low enough rate of flow that it has unsubmerged tiles, so dwarves voluntarily move into it. This can be accomplished with tricks like restricting flow through diagonal passages (see [[Pressure]] for details).  Be aware that in recent versions, dwarves can now suffer injuries more easily when [[gravity|falling]], so this method can cause serious <strike>harm</strike> [[fun]] when the dwarves are washed over the edge. Constructing the landing zone out of [[density|lighter]] materials will help prevent serious complications.

 Not pictured: exit from the swimming pool, preferably close to the entrance ramp to minimize delays in training.

===Minecart training===
With the addition of [[minecart]]s, a safe, automated swimming experience can be almost guaranteed. Originally, the design involved hauling dwarves down into a [[pond]] and forcing them to swim back out.[http://www.bay12forums.com/smf/index.php?topic=129889.0] However, it was discovered that dwarves gain swimming skill while simply riding in the minecart. A simple loop [[track]] which descends 1 Z-level into a pool of water then climbs back out will train your dwarves quickly and conveniently. It is advisable to ensure your pond has a uniform depth, because fluid [[flow]] can interfere with the minecart and may even knock it off-track; see [[Minecart logic]] for details. A depth of 4/7 or 5/7 is ideal. Note that water will slow the minecart considerably; if you use impulse ramps instead of rollers, you'll want one [[Minecart#Impulse_ramps|impulse ramp]] after roughly 10 tiles of 4/7 water.

# Carve the tracks and add impulse ramps (shown) or rollers on level z. 
# Optionally, add [[statue]]s or other buildings along the tracks for your dwarves to [[thought|admire]]. (Make sure to leave the corner walls intact).
# Fill the track section on layer z with 4/7 water. 
# Link the [[pressure plate]] '^' to the [[hatch cover]] 'H' (this is necessary to automatically dispose of [[wear|worn]] clothing that dwarves drop at the end of the ride).
# Set stop 1 to ride down the ramp to the east immediately/always.
# Assign a minecart to the route (wooden minecarts are recommended in case of collisions).
# Dwarves with the "Push/Haul Vehicles" [[labor]] enabled will now automatically train swimming.
