'''Capybara men''', while not as violent as [[badger man|badger men]], are still quite dangerous as they tend to stay in water. They will be more than happy to knock your dwarves into a [[murky pool]] where the dwarves'll drown, if they get too close.

Capybara men are able to wear dwarf-sized armor and clothing, making it a good choice for them to start in a dwarven civilization.

Some dwarves [[preference|like]] capybara men for their ''enormous rodentness'', their ''graceful swimming'', or their ''resonant barking''.
