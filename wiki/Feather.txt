'''Feathers''' are a raw material produced by [[butcher]]ing feathered creatures. While in the real world, feathers have traditionally been used for decoration, insulating fill, writing instruments, and fletching for [[arrow]]s and [[bolt]]s, there are currently no uses for feathers in ''Dwarf Fortress'', making them a prime candidate for disposal via a [[refuse]] pile, incinerator, [[atom smasher]], or the like.

Fortunately (or unfortunately, for those who prefer [[modding]] uses for feathers), a large number of birds aren't butcherable to begin with. 

[[Feather tree]]s have feathers instead of [[Tree#Growths|leaves]].
