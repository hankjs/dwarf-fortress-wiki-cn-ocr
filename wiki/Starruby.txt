'''Star rubies''' are extremely rare red [[gem]]s found in clusters of [[ruby|rubies]], which are themselves only found in clusters of [[bauxite]] - among the most valuable gems that can be found in ''Dwarf Fortress'', on par with [[diamond]]s.

Like all precious and rare gems, they may also make up part of the walls of [[unusual volcanic wall]]s.

==In real life==
The "star" pattern that this mineral is known for is caused by [[rutile]] (Titanium dioxide: TiO<sub>2</sub>) crystals that have impregnated the host corundum crystal. Star rubies are only smoothed into cabochons, as cutting them with facets does not allow the star pattern to be seen.
