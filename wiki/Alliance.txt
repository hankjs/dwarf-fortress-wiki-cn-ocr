In [[world generation]], [[civilization]]s may form '''alliances''' to stave off [[necromancer]] and [[evil]] invasions. When civilizations are feeling set upon by the more evil threats (any group that requires the killing of neutrals, like [[goblin]]s and the [[undead]]), they can join up, for as long as feels necessary, and beyond, if they get along. This has the effect of keeping the necromancers in line. A typical scenario is that the necromancer will bide their time, raise many zombies, and attack a small market in an attempt to get a 'snowball' going. This causes an alliance to be formed, and the necromancer is subsequently defeated.

Alliances only seem to play a role in the wider world. In [[fortress mode]], allied and non-allied peaceful civilizations are identical in behavior when interacting with the player.
