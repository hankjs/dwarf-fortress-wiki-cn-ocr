'''Cows''' are [[domestic animal]]s that can be brought on [[embark]]. Males are predictably called ''bulls'', while females are ''cows'' and infants are ''calves''. Much like other domestic herbivores, they require a [[pasture]] to survive, otherwise they will starve. If attacked by a hostile creature, cows will normally flee rather than fight and may be killed, so it's best to keep them someplace safe.

Cows are among the largest of all domestic livestock (losing only to [[yak]]s and [[water buffalo]]s), making them prime targets for a [[meat industry]]. They are also a good source of [[fat]], [[bone]]s and [[horns]]. As one would expect, cows can be [[milk]]ed, and their milk can be later turned into [[cheese]]. They are also fairly valuable [[pet]]s for [[Dwarf|dwarves]] who decide to adopt them.

Some dwarves [[Preferences|like]] cows for their ''haunting moos''.
