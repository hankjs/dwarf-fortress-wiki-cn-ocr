'''Trolls''' are large, predatory, dangerous subterranean evil [[creature]]s who inhabit all layers of the [[caverns]] and often appear under the command of [[goblin]]s during [[siege]]s, and have any number of [[fun|features]] which make them creatures to be taken seriously. Over four times larger than a [[dwarf]], they are [[building destroyer]]s, and will path to your [[building]]s simply for the joy of sheer destruction. During sieges, they act as battering rams, so [[trap design|design your defenses accordingly]]. They are not related to [[night troll]]s, despite the similar names. 

Wild trolls meander the underground and attack dwarves who approach or provoke them. Many of them are enslaved/absorbed by goblins during world generation and become their servants, inhabiting their [[dark pit]]s in truly huge numbers (sometimes enough to cause overwhelming lag {{bug|7526}}) and aiding their smaller masters in their battles against other races. Goblins [[Shearer|shear]] trolls for their fur, making them the evil race's equivalent of [[sheep]]. As they are intelligent (although incapable of speech), civilized trolls may gain non-military professions among goblin society. In a modded game, they may be usable in the dwarven [[textile industry]], but you can't change their labors, due to a bug. 

Trolls will almost certainly appear accompanying goblins when they siege your fortress. They are quite tough and have a variety of different ways to cause injury to your dwarves due to their humanoid bodies and large tusks. Since they only rarely wear [[armor]] (when appearing as helpers of [[goblin christmas|Goblin Claus]]), they will be easy targets for a decently-skilled squad of axedwarves, though [[silk]]-wearing trolls can complicate things, if [[copper]] and [[silver]] are the only [[Weapon#Superior metal rule|weapons-grade metals]] your fortress has available. Trolls can and will [[Wrestling|wrestle]] your dwarves, which can lead to some broken bones in your military. Unlike goblins, trolls are natural [[swim]]mers, which could be a problem for a fortress relying on a moat for defense, or using a drowning chamber or underground lake as a means of administering dwarven justice. Trolls can [[climb]], so it is possible for them to get to level one of a cavern through [[deep pit]]s and access your fortress to <s>crush the heads of</s> play with your dwarves. 

Trolls notably possess cyan-colored [[blood]] (possibly [[wikipedia:Hemocyanin|hemocyanin]]-based). Their behavior as a servant race of goblins is done via the combination of the {{token|EVIL}} and {{token|SLOW_LEARNER}} creature tokens and the fact they live underground; through modding, players can create their own subterranean goblin servants who will accompany trolls in battle by giving their race these two tokens. Unlike [[gremlin]]s, they cannot become [[pet]]s of citizens. 

Some dwarves [[Preferences|like]] trolls for their ''terrifying features''.

They also enjoy vandalizing wiki pages and causing mass annoyance. Though they do not speak, they would provoke others into angry responses with their wild claims if they could. Once a troll would successfully cause an argument between many individuals, the troll would sit back and laugh, taking an immature enjoyment out of the scenario. Sometimes, the best course of action in defeating a troll is to ignore it.
