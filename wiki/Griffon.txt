'''Griffons''' are [[fanciful]] [[creature]]s which are merely the stuff of [[legends]]. They do not actually exist, appearing only in [[engraving]]s as the fancy of artists.

Some [[Dwarf|dwarves]] [[Preferences|like]] griffons for their ''strength''.

{{D for dwarf}}

Some griffins have been known to fly to an island off the coast of Maine, fly to the top of the island and claim the island by the name of Griffin Rock. When the griffin dies of old age, humans will take the island and often bring four giant robots to protect them.

Griffins have been spotted eating a banana with the peel still on.
