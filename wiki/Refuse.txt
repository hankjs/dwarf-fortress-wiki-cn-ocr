[[File:v50_refuse_preview.png|thumb|right|Dwarf [[children]] love to play "graveyard keeper" here.]]'''Refuse''', though generally garbage, is anything which can be stored in a refuse [[stockpile]]. Such stockpiles will accept:

* [[Corpse]]s, bodyparts and bodily remains of any non-sapient and non-tame [[creatures]], including things like heads, teeth, and feathers (note that the corpses of undead creatures count as non-sapient even if the living versions are sapient, and go in the corpse section of a refuse stockpile instead of a dedicated corpse stockpile)
* By-products of the [[meat industry|meat]] and [[fishing industry|fishing]] industries ([[bones]], raw hide, [[shell]]s)
* Things which are rotten (rotten meat, rotten meals, rotten raw hide)
* Things the dwarves have no further use for (withered plants, damaged furniture, [[Wear|tattered]] clothes)
* [[Vermin]] remains

== Uses for refuse ==
Despite the name "refuse", some items can be valuable resources for dwarven industries:

===[[Bone]]s===
A single bone can be used to make a stack of bone [[bolt]]s [5], a bone [[crossbow]], 1-3 bone [[craft]]s, or a bone [[decoration]]. Multiple bones can be used to make bone [[armor]] (no breastplates, mailshirts or boots). A stack of bones may be required for some [[strange mood]] creations.
===[[Skin|Raw hides]]===
A raw hide from any size of creature can be tanned at a [[Tanner's shop|tannery]] to produce a single unit of [[leather]]. Leather can be used to make leather clothes, leather armor, leather crafts, [[Equipment#Quivers|quivers]], [[Equipment#Backpacks|backpacks]], [[DF2012:Flask|waterskins]], [[Armor#Shield|shields]], and [[decoration]]s. Leather may be required for some [[strange mood]] creations.

===[[Wool]]===
Butchering or [[Shearer|shearing]] [[sheep]], [[llama]]s or [[alpaca]]s produces a stack of wool. Each unit of wool can be spun into yarn thread at a [[farmer's workshop]]. Yarn thread can then be woven into cloth and used to produce clothes, crafts, and decorations. Woolen cloth may be required for some [[strange mood]] creations.

===[[Hair]]===
The hair of butchered creatures (e.g. [[horse]]s or [[cow|cattle]]) can be spun into [[thread]], too, although such thread can only be used in [[healthcare]], [[bookbinding]], and [[trade]].

===Teeth, ivory, and horn===
These items can be processed by a [[bone carver]] to produce crafts and decorations.

===[[Shell]]s===
Shells can be used to produce a few types of [[armor]], crafts, and decorations. Shells may also be required for some [[strange mood]] creations.

===[[Skull]]s===
The skulls of kittens, poultry and other creatures don't need to lie uselessly in your refuse stockpile - your [[bone carver]] can use them to make [[totem]]s, a trade good.

===Sapient corpses===
Sapient creatures are still listed in the subcategories of refuse stockpiles, even though those go in a [[corpse]] stockpile; this is due to the undead not being considered sapient. So, it may be best to keep refuse corpse stockpiles out of obvious view, as dwarves may be horrified by the sight of such corpses, cancelling their job and giving the dwarf [[Thought#Injury_and_death|bad thoughts]], unless the dwarf has a high level of [[discipline]]. Horrified merchants may also scuttle their wagons, drop their merchandise, and flee{{bug|7185}}, which will cause diplomatic penalties associated with losing their goods.{{verify|do either of these happen specifically with undead corpses? if not this is off topic}} Being horrified will also give a small amount of experience towards the [[discipline]] skill, so it's possible to exploit such stockpiles to increase the discipline of your dwarves, though this is generally ill-advised due to the high likelihood of [[Insanity|fun]].

Since the corpses of undead former sapient creatures are not considered sapient, they can be used for the same things as any wild animal corpse. The corpses of undead former fortress citizens can not be buried{{bug|10396}}, and this might cause [[ghost|issues]] if they are not properly [[memorial]]ized.

== Refuse Stockpiles ==
A refuse stockpile works just like any other [[stockpile]] and is different from a [[Activity zone#Garbage dump|garbage dump]] zone (which accepts items explicitly marked to be dumped). The standard predefined refuse stockpile (designated by {{k|p}}-{{k|r}}) includes all types of refuse. Customized [[Stockpile#Stockpile_Settings|stockpiles]] can allow you to sort out the usable "refuse", the rotting refuse, the unusable but not rotting refuse, or even the [[Siege#Necromancer_sieges|reanimatable]] refuse. Disabling certain types of refuse in all refuse stockpiles will cause those items to accumulate wherever they are produced (eg. bones in the butcher shop) instead of tying up stockpile space.

== Avoiding Miasma ==
Some types of refuse rot, and rotting refuse produces [[miasma]] when in a subterranean tile. To avoid the miasma, you can [[garbage disposal|destroy refuse]] before it rots, or store rotting refuse in a {{DFtext|Light|6:1}} and {{DFtext|Above Ground|2:1}} tile (see [[tile attributes]]). A refuse pile on the surface works, as does exposing any part of your fortress' {{DFtext|Inside |6:0}}{{DFtext|Dark Subterranean|0:1}} tiles to sunlight and then covering them with constructed floors or walls. Such tiles will remain {{DFtext|Light |6:1}}{{DFtext|Above Ground|2:1}} and thus the refuse stored there will not generate any miasma.

== Refuse collection options ==
{{main|Standing orders}}

Refuse items lying outside your fortress will be ignored by default. You can toggle collection of refuse in the [[standing orders]] menu, {{Menu icon|y}}. Note that this setting also controls the collection of "[[dump]]ed" items outside your fortress.
