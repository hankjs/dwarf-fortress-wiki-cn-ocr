'''Giant coyotes''' are large dog-like monsters with a haunting howl. They appear in groups of 2-10 in most savage [[biome]]s, and are pack hunters that are bigger than [[elk]]s. Lacking the {{token|LARGE_PREDATOR|c}} token, they aren't very aggressive towards dwarves, though they butcher into a medium-sized amount of [[meat|food]] returns, and so may help a struggling fortress to get by.
:''Dwarves [[Preferences|like]] giant coyotes for their howling''.
