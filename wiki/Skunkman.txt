'''Skunk men''' are [[animal people]] versions of the common [[skunk]], who can be found in [[savage]] [[temperate]] flatlands and [[forest]]s. They spawn in groups of 1-5 individuals and are generally content to keep to themselves. In terms of size, they are a little over half the weight of the average [[dwarf]].

Like other savage animal people, they can join [[civilization]]s, become [[historical figure]]s, appear as [[visitor]]s and be playable in [[adventurer mode]].

Some dwarves [[Preferences|like]] skunk men for their ''foul smell'' and their ''distinctive striping''.

Despite popular belief, skunk men do not speak in a French accent while playing the role of a passive-aggressive and tenacious romantic. They also do not forcefully try to make [[cat]]s or cat humanoids their wives or girlfriends.
