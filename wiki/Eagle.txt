'''Eagles''' are a species of [[Creature|bird]] found inhabiting a wide variety of [[biome]]s. They spawn one at a time and do little but fly through the air aimlessly. Smaller than a [[cat]] and entirely benign, they are harmless to all but the most unlucky of [[dwarves]], still the mere sight of an eagle can terrify above-ground pastured livestock (including creatures as big as unicorns). All eagles are born with Legendary [[skill]] in [[Climber|climbing]].

Eagles can be captured in [[cage]] [[trap]]s and [[Animal trainer|trained]] into cheap [[pet]]s. They can be placed in a [[nest box]] to lay a meager quantity of [[egg]]s or [[butcher]]ed for a small amount of returns. Since domestic birds give plenty more of both, using eagles as livestock is a subpar proposition.

Some dwarves [[Preferences|like]] eagles for their ''high soaring''.
