'''Giant bark scorpions''' are [[Giant animal|super-sized]] versions of the common [[bark scorpion]] who inhabit [[savage]] [[desert]]s and some [[tropical]] areas. While the original critters are some of the smallest in the game, their giant cousins are 3 times the size of a [[dwarf]], weigh about as much as a [[troll]]. While they don't go out of their way to hunt dwarves, they are carnivorous and will attack when provoked by snatching with their pincers and stinging enemies with their stinger tails, injecting a [[Syndrome|venom]] which causes pain to the victim. Giant bark scorpions are large enough for this venom to quickly knock dwarves out cold, leaving them vulnerable to a finishing blow to the head. Additionally, the creatures are [[No Pain|immune to pain]] themselves, as well as unaffected by [[No Stun|stunning]], fear or paralysis effects. All giant bark scorpions possess Legendary [[skill]] in [[Climber|climbing]].

Giant bark scorpions may be captured in [[cage]] [[trap]]s and [[Animal trainer|trained]] into [[pet]]s, possessing the standard high value of savage animals. They are born adults, fully-sized right at birth, and can't be fully tamed. Their many limbs translate to a fairly high amount of returns when [[butcher]]ed, and while the idea of breeding them for the purpose of [[fortress defense]] is attractive, the creatures may die of old age at anywhere from 10 to just 2 years of age, making them unpredictable in reliability. They are exotic [[mount]]s and may be witnessed being ridden by [[Elf|elves]] during [[siege]]s.

Some dwarves [[Preferences|like]] giant bark scorpions for their ''pincers'' and their ''stinging tail''.
