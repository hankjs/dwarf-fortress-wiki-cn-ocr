'''Echidna men''' are [[animal people]] variants of the common [[echidna]] who can be found in [[savage]] [[temperate]] and [[desert]] regions. They spawn in groups of 1-5 individuals and are generally peaceful, as well as surprisingly resilient. Even crossbow [[bolt]]s and [[whip]]s seem to be unable to penetrate past their muscles, leading to long, drawn-out battles waiting for them to bleed out. This makes echidna men relatively useful for [[live training]], or as bait in a [[trap design|devious trap]]. In terms of size, they are a little over half the weight of the average [[dwarf]].

Like other savage animal people, they can join [[civilization]]s, become [[historical figure]]s, appear as [[visitor]]s and be playable in [[adventurer mode]].

Some dwarves [[Preferences|like]] echidna men for their ''spines'' and their ''egg-laying''.

== Bugs ==
If a curled-up or retracted creature dies, and is then reanimated by a necromancer, it retains the effects of being curled-up, but can move and attack as normal. As a result, for example an undead echidna is invulnerable to destruction{{bug|11463}}. It combines well with a separate bug that allows curled-up undead to attack{{bug|10519}}.

As a result, the undead echidna may at the same time be curled-up (making it unkillable) and move/attack. The same problem also affects the [[echidna man]], [[giant echidna]], [[giant hedgehog]] and [[hedgehog man]].

Modding the game and removing [PREVENTS_PARENT_COLLAPSE] from the spine body part of the affected animals will allow them to be pulped and killed while curled up. While it makes normal echidnas weaker, this is not a major problem, as echidnas are not supposed to be really hard to kill. This workaround [http://www.bay12forums.com/smf/index.php?topic=175473.msg8111524#msg8111524 may restore otherwise unplayable games].

It was also reported that in adventure mode "I was able to finally kill the zombie by lighting fires underneath him/around him then waiting for a long time; eventually he 'died in the heat.'"{{bug|10519}}.

<!-- Uganda Knuckles meme -->
Echidna men practice a religion known as 'The Way.' They actively and enthusiastically seek out other worshippers of their deity, but seem unwilling to proselytize to those not familiar with their beliefs.

<!-- Reference: Sonic the Hedgehog franchise -->
Echidna men generally find shows of strength to be more entertaining than comedy. Accounts of echidna men chuckling are few and far between. They do not guard large emeralds on floating islands, nor do they have access to sanctuaries in the sky. They also do not accompany [[hedgehog man|hedgehog men]] on adventures against technologically-advanced [[villain]]s.

<!-- Reference: Real life mystery of an echidna having a 4-headed penis -->
Dwarven scientists have, as of yet, not determined whether echidna men possess 4-headed penises.
