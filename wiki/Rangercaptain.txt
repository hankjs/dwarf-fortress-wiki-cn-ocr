The '''ranger captain''' is a [[noble]] position used by [[elf|elves]], appointed and commanded by the [[monarch|princess]]. It is presumably intended as an equivalent to [[captain]]s or [[lieutenant]]s, leading a squad of 10 rangers. In addition to this, ranger captains have "attack enemies" and "patrol territory" as responsibilities, but their exact effects are unclear.
They are not appointed in civilization creation, because their Position_token NUMBER is not fixed, it is AS_NEEDED. This means that they are only then created when they are needed, and those circumstanses are very rare.
