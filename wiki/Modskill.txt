'''Skill 1, 2, 3, 4 etc.''' are skills that may be used for modding via the MODSKILL01, MODSKILL02, MODSKILL03, MODSKILL04 etc. tokens, up to 10. As they do not have a labor, they cannot be controlled for with work details; however, they work just as skills normally do, and thus act as a replacement for the earlier [[DF2014:alchemy|alchemy]] skill.
