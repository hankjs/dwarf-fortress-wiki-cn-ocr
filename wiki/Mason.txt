'''Mason''' is the skill associated with the '''masonry''' [[labor]]. Masons are responsible for constructing certain [[building]]s out of [[stone]], specifically [[trade depot]]s, [[bridge]]s, [[furnace]]s, and [[well]]s, and their building quality and value{{verify}} are influenced by the mason's skill.

The mason skill is ''not'' used when constructing things like [[walls]], [[floors]], [[stairs]], or [[roads]], even if they are made from stone blocks. Those [[construction]]s use the [[Construction#Required labors|Wall/Floor construction]] and [[Road|Road building]] labors respectively and have no corresponding skill. Graphically, masons wear all white clothes.

In previous versions a "Mason" was what is now a [[Stone carver]], and an "[[Architect]]" covered the current duties of Mason.
