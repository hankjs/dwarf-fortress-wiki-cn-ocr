'''Mythical substances''' are procedurally-generated [[liquid]]s and [[glob]]s with [[Magic|magical]] properties. Each world has a number of differently-named substances, such as "odd jelly" or "peculiar broth," though currently all of them carry the same [[syndrome]].

==Healing potion==
A [[mysterious dungeon]]'s [[Dungeon guardian|guardian]] carries a [[waterskin]] filled with a restorative substance that they can consume in combat. Ingesting it grants a powerful [[syndrome]] that cures nearly all [[wound]]s, even [[Syndrome#CE_REGROW_PARTS|regrowing limbs]] and [[Syndrome#CE_HEAL_NERVES|healing nerve damage]]. It does not heal blood loss. However, it can allow you to live through Titan fire long enough to stop you from melting.

Creatures that are [[Construct creature|immune to poison]] (not ``GENERAL_POISON``) do not benefit from this substance.
