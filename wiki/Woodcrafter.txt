'''Wood crafter''' is the skill associated with the '''woodcrafting''' [[labor]]. Woodcrafters make [[wood]]en [[crafts]], [[bolt]]s, [[nest box]]es, [[jug]]s, [[pot]]s and [[hive]]s at a [[craftsdwarf's workshop]].  Some [[instrument]] and instrument parts may require wood crafting, depending on the particular world. As with other crafting skills, higher skill means faster performance and higher [[item quality]]. 

Because wood has a low material [[value]], and is very useful for other purposes, a woodcrafter is somewhat less useful than a stonecrafter or bone carver. However, if wood is plentiful, then wooden bolts can be a useful supplement to bone for training purposes.  Wooden pots are nearly identical to wooden barrels, so you could have your woodcrafter make them while your [[carpenter]] makes other things.
