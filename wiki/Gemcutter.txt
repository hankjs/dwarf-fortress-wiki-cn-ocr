A '''gem cutter''' is the profession of a dwarf whose highest skill is in gem cutting. Performed at a [[Jeweler's workshop]], gem cutting is the basis of the [[gem industry]], turning mildly valuable [[gem]] clusters you find as you [[mining|mine]] away rock into valuable [[decoration]]s for [[furniture]] and [[Finished goods|trade good]]s. It is the counterpart to [[gem setting]]; together, the two belong to the category profession of the [[Jeweler]], and indeed if a dwarf has a relatively balanced skill level in both, they will be known as a Jeweler. (More often than not, migrants who are skilled in gem cutting will also be similarly skilled in gem setting.)

Large amounts of mining are bound to produce dozens of rough gems, so gem cutting is a method of developing [[wealth]] quickly, [[Quickstart guide#Gemcutting and Trinkets|especially]] for new players. Cutting and encrusting with a gem more than triples the [[value]] of the rough gem, which is then multiplied by a [[quality]] modifier based on the gem setter's skill. A [[masterwork]] gem decoration is worth nearly 12x the value of the original rough gem.

Not every raw gem that is cut will become "set-able". Cutting a gem can result in 1) a cut gem, 2) a [[large gem]], or 3) a gem [[craft]]. Cut gems are the most likely, and are used by a gem setter in creating gem [[window]]s and [[encrust]]ing other objects. Large gems and gem crafts are only created one-third (33%) of the time. Large gems ''cannot'' be set, and so are currently only useful for [[trade]]. The skill level of a gem cutter affects the cutting speed, and the [[quality]] of large gems and gem crafts, but not the quantity of crafts produced.  Standard cut gems do not have a quality, but a decoration using them does, and that quality is multiplied by the [[material value]] of the gem. 

So, the only advantage of a high-skill gem cutter is in the quality of those fewer large gems and crafts. A low-skill gem cutter will produce the same cut gems as a [[Legendary]] skill one, it will just take longer; look for a skilled gem ''setter'' to produce your highest value end-product decorations.

=== Training ===
Gem cutters can cut not only gems, but regular [[stone]] and [[glass]] as well. Although cut stone is next to worthless, it still provides experience, and can be used to keep a jeweler busy while you mine out a fresh batch of gems. It is also the only way to decorate with stone, and an easy way to create [[window]]s without [[fuel]] or [[sand]]. However, with a [[magma]] and a sand source, raw green glass can be mass-produced, which is worth the exact same as the cheapest gems.

{{D for Dwarf}}

How one cuts gems without a chisel or any other tool is a source of much study. The predominant theory is that dwarven teeth, sharpened and conditioned by years of eating the tough flesh of [[plump helmet]]s, function as a crude cutting tool hard enough to cut diamonds. This is followed by polishing the gem using the tough fibers of their beards, just as it's used to smooth surfaces.
