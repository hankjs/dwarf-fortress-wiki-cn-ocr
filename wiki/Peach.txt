'''Peach''' is one of the many genera of [[tree]]s found above ground. Like the vast majority of above ground trees, peach [[wood]] is brown and produces brown products. Logs can be processed in a [[dyer's shop]] into amber [[dye]].

Peach trees can be harvested by <s>suspiciously elf-like</s> dwarves using a [[stepladder]]. Gathered peaches can be eaten raw, cooked, or be made into peach cider, a type of [[alcohol]].

Some [[Dwarf|dwarves]] [[Preferences|like]] peach trees for their ''fruit''.
