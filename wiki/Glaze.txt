'''Glaze''' is a special coating that can be applied to jugs, [[statue]]s, large pots, and [[trade good|crafts]] made from either [[stone]] or [[ceramic]]. Jugs made from [[earthenware]] cannot be used to store liquids until they have been glazed, while jugs of other materials (and other containers in general) have no such restrictions.

Two types of glaze can be applied: [[ash glaze]] and [[tin glaze]]. Glaze is applied at a [[kiln]] or [[magma kiln]], and the type of glaze to be used cannot be chosen - the nearest glaze material to the relevant worker will be used and the corresponding glaze will be applied. (Note that glazes are not products in themselves, you do not make a glaze and then apply it to the ware.)

The application of glaze to stone and ceramic goods is performed by dwarves with the [[glazing]] labor enabled and grants experience in the [[glazer]] skill.

Glazes otherwise work like decorations. Ash glaze increases the glazed item's value by 50☼, tin glaze by 100☼, multiplied by the [[quality]].

{{mod}}
Certain uncraftable containers, which may be obtained by [[modding]] or [[cheating]], require glazing just like earthernware. [[Pot]]s, [[jug]]s and [[goblet]]s made of the following solid materials have nonzero {{token|ABSORPTION|md}}, and as such cannot store liquids until glazed:
* All types of raw [[clay]], [[soil]], and [[sand]]
* [[Bone]]
* [[Shell]]
* [[Skin]], [[leather]], and [[parchment]]
* [[Scale]]s and [[chitin]]
* [[Meat]] and organs
* [[Fat]] and [[tallow]]
* [[Cartilage]]
* [[Silk]], [[yarn]], and plant [[thread]]
* [[Hair]]
* [[Feather]]s
* [[Nail]], [[tooth]], [[horn]], and [[hoof]]
* [[Pearl]]
* [[Soap]]
* [[Cheese]]
* [[Sponge]]
* [[Egg]]shell
* Miscellanous [[plant]] materials such as [[fruit]] and [[seed]]
