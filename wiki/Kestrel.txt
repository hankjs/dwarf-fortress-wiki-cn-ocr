'''Kestrels''' are a species of [[Creature|bird]] found in a number of different [[biome]]s. They appear individually and are entirely benign, doing little but fly through the air aimlessly. They are one of the smallest animals in the game who aren't outright [[vermin]], making them harmless to all but the most unlucky of [[dwarves]]. All kestrels are born with Legendary [[skill]] in [[Climber|climbing]].

Kestrels can be captured in [[cage]] [[trap]]s and [[Animal trainer|trained]] into cheap [[pet]]s. Hunted kestrels are too small to be [[butcher]]ed and slaughtered trained ones will only yield a [[skull]], making them useless for a [[meat industry]], though their females can be placed in a [[nest box]] to lay a small amount of [[egg]]s. While they're a type of falcon, kestrels don't share the same vermin-hunting abilities of the [[peregrine falcon]].

Some dwarves [[Preferences|like]] kestrels for their ''coloration'' and their ''hunting prowess''.
