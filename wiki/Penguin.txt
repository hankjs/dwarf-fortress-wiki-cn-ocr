'''Penguins''' are small [[creature]]s found inhabiting arctic [[ocean]]s, where they spawn in groups of 5-10 individuals. Only as big as a [[blue peafowl]], these tiny flightless birds are completely inoffensive, serving as little more than a distraction for a [[dwarf]]. They produce very few products when [[butcher]]ed, making [[Hunter|hunting]] them for [[food]] rather worthless, though they are arguably useful as target practice, at least.

Penguins possess a [[pet]] value of 10, but unlike most animals, they are not [[Animal trainer|trainable]].

Some dwarves [[Preferences|like]] penguins for their ''coloration'', their ''waddling gait'', and their ''way of flying through the water''.
