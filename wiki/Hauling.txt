<div style="margin-top:10px;">[[File:df_haul_anim.gif|right]]</div>'''Hauling''' is the process of carrying an object to a new location. Objects being carried by a creature will show up in the creature's inventory as "Hauled". There are several specific hauling [[labor]]s, based on the type(s) of items to be moved; these labors may be enabled or disabled on dwarves as needed. Note that hauling tasks can be modified by [[burrow]]s, [[standing orders]], and item state (in use or [[forbid]]den). Most types of hauling can be paused by disabling them on the standing orders(''{{k|y}}: Labor -> Standing Orders tab -> Hauling).

In popular usage, the term '''hauler''' refers to a dwarf in [[fortress mode]] who has no labors enabled other than hauling. In large fortresses where there may be great distances for haulers to travel, individual hauling tasks may take a long time to complete. Using dedicated haulers allows specialist dwarves to spend more time in their [[workshop]]s, instead of dragging raw materials or finished products around. Haulers are good candidates for [[cross-training]] to help improve their strength and agility [[attributes]], which are important when moving heavy objects across a fortress quickly. (Ironically, hauling does not train attributes itself.)

To improve the efficiency of hauling items to [[stockpile]]s, [[Storage|containers]], [[minecart]]s, and [[wheelbarrow]]s can be employed. Note, however, that due to a number of outstanding bugs, there are a few cases where these tools ''decrease'' efficiency; see [[#Bugs|Bugs]] for more information.

== Automatic hauling ==
[[File:carry_dwarf.jpg|thumb|170px|right|Even carved horn dwarves are busy.]]Some hauling tasks do not require any hauling [[labor]]:
* A dwarf working at a workshop will gather the raw materials needed to produce wanted goods. However, produced goods require the appropriate hauling [[labor]] to be moved out of the workshop in order to avoid [[clutter]].  Dwarves producing goods at a workshop tend to keep producing them and will not necessarily clear their own workshops of clutter even when they have the appropriate hauling labor enabled.
* A [[mood|moody]] dwarf will gather the raw materials needed for a mysterious construction.
* A dwarf {{k|b}}uilding something will move the needed materials to the construction site.
** Before a dwarf will build something, he will need to have the appropriate labor as specified by the task. If the dwarf is building a chair or similar, the dwarf needs Furniture Hauling; if the dwarf is building a wooden wall, it's Building Construction, and so forth. Workshops are usually constructed by any dwarf that can work in that workshop.
** A dwarf will clear the tiles where he/she builds from all scattered objects ('''stone !!!''') before starting the build
* A [[herbalist]] will haul any successfully-gathered plant to a stockpile immediately, if there is space available in one.  They also pick up and move [[stepladder]]s around as necessary.
* Dwarves in the midst of eating will carry their meal to a table. Military dwarves, however, will eat directly off of the floor.{{verify}}
* Dwarves who have just finished drinking booze will return their barrel to the nearest food stockpile.
* If you have the "All dwarves harvest" option turned on, all dwarves will help bring in the harvest, even if they don't have Food Hauling enabled.
* Various medical tasks such as bringing injured dwarves food or water, dressing wounds, and so forth have their own labors associated with them and do not require hauling.

== Stone hauling ==
Dwarves with the stone hauling [[labor]] enabled will haul [[stone]]s and [[ore]]s to the appropriate [[stockpile]]s.

Note: Boulders left behind by digging are incredibly heavy, making hauling them by hand long distances a very time-consuming job. A dwarf may spend weeks carrying just one [[cinnabar]] boulder. See the section on [[Stone management]] for tips on combating this problem.

== Wood hauling ==
Dwarves with the wood hauling [[labor]] enabled will haul wood [[log]]s to the corresponding [[stockpile]]s. This job usually entails leaving the fortress to get the logs felled on the outside, possibly exposing dwarves to [[Animals|fauna]], [[invaders]] and [[Cave adaptation|sunlight]], so you may wish to bar important dwarves from performing this task.

== Item hauling ==
Dwarves with the item hauling [[labor]] will haul miscellaneous items like blocks and collect [[sand]] for a [[glass furnace]] or [[clay]] for a [[kiln]]. Finished goods (such as crafted goods) and [[gem]]s (both rough and cut) are also considered Items. If multiple items have the same bin as destination, then dwarves can pick up multiple of these items before storing them in a bin, allthough (even if the items are initially in the same location) the hauling dwarf will often (after each pick-up) walk a few tiles before heading back to pick up another item.

Stone blocks are also moved using the item hauling labor.

== Food hauling ==
Dwarves with the food hauling [[labor]] will haul food and drinks to the appropriate [[stockpile]]s. These dwarves will also store food in barrels. Storing food in a stockpile has a higher priority than moving food, which is already in a food stockpile, but not in a barrel, into a barrel. When storing food in a barrel (and the barrel is not yet in the assigned food stockpile), the food will usually be moved first into the barrel and then the barrel will be moved to the assigned food stockpile.

== Refuse hauling ==
Dwarves with the refuse hauling [[labor]] will haul rotting food, and non-dwarf bodyparts to refuse [[stockpile]]s. They will also [[dump]] marked items to the appropriate garbage [[activity zone]]. This job usually entails dealing with dead bodies and leaving the fortress to get the deceased's body on the outside, possibly exposing dwarves to [[Stress|trauma]], [[Animals|fauna]], [[invaders]], and [[Cave adaptation|sunlight]], so you may wish to bar important or depression-prone dwarves from performing this task. Refuse hauling is subject to standing orders (''{{k|y}}: Labor -> Standing Orders tab -> Refuse and Dumping).

It is possible to use standing orders to forbid all the dead's bodies and items on death, to prevent haulers from running into an active confrontation. Remember to claim they back later when it's safe using the 'designate item' tool({{k|i}}), or the bodies will be left to rot.

== Burial ==
Dwarves with the burial [[labor]] will haul dwarf and pet [[corpse]]s and bodyparts to corpse [[stockpile]]s or [[coffin]]s. This job usually entails dealing with dead bodies and leaving the fortress to get the deceased's body on the outside, possibly exposing dwarves to [[Stress|trauma]], [[Animals|fauna]], [[invaders]], and [[Cave adaptation|sunlight]], so you may wish to bar important or depression-prone dwarves from performing this task. Burial items are subject to standing orders (''{{k|y}}: Labor -> Standing Orders tab -> Sieges and forbidding).

It is possible to use standing orders to forbid all the dead's bodies and items on death, to prevent haulers from running into an active confrontation. Remember to claim them back later when it's safe using the 'designate item' tool({{k|i}}), or the bodies will be left to rot.

== Furniture hauling ==
Dwarves with the furniture hauling [[labor]] will haul [[furniture]] to the appropriate [[stockpile]]s, this includes adding empty bins to a stockpile or adding a wheelbarrow to a stockpile (ie. stone stockpile). They will also '''{{k|b}}uild''' simple furniture items ([[bed]]s, [[chair]]s, [[table]]s, etc.).

== Animal hauling ==
Dwarves with the animal hauling [[labor]] will haul [[animal trap]]s and occupied [[cage]]s to the appropriate [[stockpile]]s, and lead uncaged animals to [[pasture]]s and other destinations. Animal hauling isn't required for jobs such as shearing, butchering or milking animals. Note that leading an uncaged animal is slower than moving a wheelbarrow, so it might be advantageous for longer hauling distances to cage the animal first and then move the cage by wheelbarrow (or have the animal walk by itself nearer to the destination, which might just happen with animals domesticated as a child and animals bonded to a trainer as these, unless they are also of the vermin hunting variety, have the tendency to move to the location of the trainer, when they get unassigned from a pasture).

Wild or hostile animals require both animal hauling and [[animal training]] labors to move to a [[cage]] or [[chain]].{{bug|8080}}

== Trade good hauling ==
Dwarves with the Trade Good hauling [[labor]] will bring goods to the [[Trade depot|depot]]. Trade Good hauling has a high priority, higher than all other job hauling priorities. Also many workshop jobs, where the hauling of items to the workshop is in progress, might get delayed, if the dwarf has Trade Good hauling enabled, as the dwarf might after hauling an item to the workshop then take a Trade Good hauling job before resuming the job in the workshop. But Dwarfs performing a priority 1 job, ie. mining, smoothing, engraving etc. jobs with designation priority 1, who are also assigned to Trade Good Hauling duty, will continue their jobs (at least as long as the current/next job of that type also has designation priority 1).

== Water hauling ==
Dwarves with the water hauling [[labor]] will use [[bucket]]s to fill pits and ponds from a water-source [[zone]].

== Tips and issues ==
In order to minimize hauling trips, stockpiles should be placed with care.
* Input and output stockpiles should be placed near corresponding [[workshop]]s. Consider proximity of input stockpiles to be about an order of magnitude more important; a working dwarf wastes time to get his own material, but having some haulers is enough to take care of moving the product. 
* Construction preparation: when constructing something big away from your fort (e.g. a road), the dwarf assigned to the construction will have to carry each item from your fort to the construction location, which can take a long time. By putting stockpiles near your construction project, many dwarves may participate in the hauling, thus dramatically increasing construction speed.  Note that materials are allocated at the time of building, so be sure the stockpile is filled before placing the construction order, otherwise the materials will still have to come from afar.
*Consider specializing your haulers if possible - food haulers that orbit around the kitchen/dining room/farm area, stone haulers that orbit around the mines and furnaces, and (if possible/needed) wood haulers that do likewise with the carpenter shop.  Turn off refuse hauling if that dwarf isn't going to be near areas likely to have refuse.  This keeps the mine hauler from deciding to walk aaaallll the way over to the kitchens for one load, and then out to the forest for one, and then back to the smelters, and so on.
*Furthermore, you can handpick your specialized hauler, selecting them by their attributes. A wood hauler might be chosen because of his agility, since he might have to walk a lot of tiles to reach the forest, depending on the fortress and map layout. A stone hauler, on the other hand, might be chosen because of her strength so that she can pick up and carry heavy stones (such as [[gold]] and [[platinum]]) more quickly.
*The [[Grower]] profession can have a ''huge'' impact on hauling - see [[farming]] for a discussion.
*If you create a loop of [[stockpile]]s giving to each other (i.e. creating a circle A->B->C->A), your dwarves will spend their entire time hauling.
* [[Wheelbarrow]]s can significantly reduce the time needed to move heavy goods like stone and ore.  [[Minecart]] tracks and systems, while time-consuming to set up, can drastically cut down hauling times for some purposes, such as moving furniture from magma forges to a central stockpile.

=== Backlogs ===
To ensure that high-priority hauling tasks (like food), to clean up after get done quickly, you should employ a large number of haulers.  This is most important for food hauling, where [[prepared meal]]s in the [[kitchen]] often rot while your dwarves are hauling individual seeds left behind after someone eats a plump helmet, or if your hunters bring a herd of animals in for your [[butcher]]s all at once.

==Bugs==

* Hauling jobs block access to all the items in the destination containers until the hauling is complete. This often results in cancellation spam and work delays.{{bug|9004}} One workaround is creating a "feeder stockpile" with containers disabled.

*Wheelbarrows are only used to haul stone '''to''' a stockpile and limits the number of active hauling jobs to the number of available wheelbarrows. see [[Wheelbarrow]] for details.

*If a dwarf is hauling an item when the destination becomes unreachable the dwarf will spam job cancellation messages repeatedly.{{bug|597}} [[Forbid]]ding the item in inventory will clear up the problem.
