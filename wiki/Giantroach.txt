'''Giant roaches''' are the much larger [[Creature|cousins]] of the common [[large roach]], found in most [[savage]] [[biome]]s. Over three times bigger than a [[dwarf]], these insects aren't benign and will defend themselves if provoked. They lack any sort of offensive attack and rely on [[push]]es for self-defense; however, they are large enough to potentially injure a dwarf with such attacks. Additionally, they also can use their wings for wrestling, potentially leading to the absurd circumstance of a dwarf getting throttled to death by giant disgusting [[vermin]]. All giant roaches are born full-sized adults, and with Legendary [[skill]] in [[Climber|climbing]]. 

Giant roaches can be captured in [[cage]] [[trap]]s and [[Animal trainer|trained]] into [[pet]]s, possessing the standard high value of giant creatures. Keeping giant roaches as long-term fortress pets isn't a good idea, however, due to their exceptionally short lifespan - they only live for one measly year. Any dwarf who adopts them as pets will find them dying very quickly, and their lifespans are too short for a giant roach farm to be viable. The player should instead consider [[butcher]]ing them for [[food]] and [[fat]] while they can. Giant roaches are exotic [[mount]]s and can be ridden by [[Elf|elves]] during [[siege]]s.

Some dwarves [[Preferences|like]] giant roaches for their ''ability to disgust''.
