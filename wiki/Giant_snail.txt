'''Giant snails''' are predictably quite slow, as large as a [[grizzly bear]] and generally harmless. They are a good source of meat, fat, and especially [[shell]]s (mostly for [[artifact]] requirements) in a pinch. They can cripple and may kill an unarmored dwarf with their [[push]] attacks, though, so you might want to send basic militia or a marksdwarf to [[hunter|hunt]] it.  Giant snails can be tamed, but they are genderless and will not breed.

Like standard [[snail]]s, giant snails can be found in every non-freezing savage [[biome]]. They may occasionally appear as [[mount]]s during a [[siege]], but only [[elf|fools]] would ride into battle on something as slow and relatively harmless as a giant snail.

Some dwarves [[Preferences|like]] giant snails for their ''shells''.

Humans are known to decorate their codices with images of this fearsome creature, indicating that this beast may have once been among the [[King_of_beasts|kings of beasts]] in the distant past.
