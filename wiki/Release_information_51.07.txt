==Alexandra's notes==
Hey everyone,

It's Alexandra here as we continue along with the routine patches after [[Adventure Mode]] release. We have quality of life fixes for [[Fortress Mode]] including the new ability to use the previous [[material]] when replacing [[constructions]]. No need to go back through the menus over and over again! Over in Adventure Mode your [[speed]] is now displayed properly. Lots of other adjustment and fixes here as well.

So far the lua tests are going smoothly and we are receiving really great feedback. If you're a mod-minded urist and want to play round with the [[lua]] update, you can check it out on the Experimental Branch.

See you in the next patch,

[[Alexandra]]
