'''Siltstone''' is one of many otherwise-unremarkable [[sedimentary layer]] [[stone]]s.

==In real life==
Siltstone is a type of clastic sedimentary stone, in which the grains range in size from 1/16th of a millimeter to 1/256th of a millimeter. Stone comprised of grains larger than 1/16th of a millimeter is called [[sandstone]], while stone comprised of grains smaller than 1/256th of a millimeter is called [[mudstone]].
