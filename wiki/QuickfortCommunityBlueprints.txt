The '''Quickfort Community Blueprints''' pack is a collection of blueprints for use with Quickfort, drawn from all over the community.[https://github.com/Lazy-Newb-Pack/Quickfort-Community-Blueprints The most recent version of the pack is v2.3] comes with images to help visualize most designs. It is hosted on GitHub and can be downloaded as a [https://github.com/Lazy-Newb-Pack/Quickfort-Community-Blueprints/zipball/master/ single zip bundle from there]. Their use requires a basic understanding of Quickfort. 

The Community Blueprints are organized in thematically sorted in modules. Providing a wide amount of solutions to common challenges. Reaching from simple one laxer digs to complex sequences of blueprints making full use of the more advanced Quickfort syntax. Due to their popularity the Blueprints stayed in use for over a decade up to now and have grown over the years while passed through the hands of many keepers.

== How to use these blueprints? ==
You can view the blueprints directly on the GitHub. Browsing either the images or by clicking on the .csv and .xlsx and read the files as tables.

== History ==
The first (?) ''known'' version of the Community Blueprints were collected by andrewx8 and distributed through mediafire in August 2012. They where prominently [http://www.bay12forums.com/smf/index.php?topic=35931.msg562077#msg562077 mentioned in the release notice to Quickfort 2.04] later the same month. In 2014 spfifle releasd a new and improved version of the Pack called v2. Duplicate entries got deleted and blueprints thematically sorted. The updated bundle further added blueprints in .png and .bmp format to support now obsolete image designators like [[v0.34:Utilities#ChromaFort|ChromaFort]] and [[v0.34:Utilities#Picturefort|Picturefort]]. The images further allow for a quick visualization of the blueprints.

With Version 2.1 the pack became a part of became Linux LNP ([[Utility:Lazy Newb Pack|Lazy Newb Pack]]) now maintained by PeridexisErrant. In 2015 the Community Blueprints been uploaded to GitHub as part of the core LNP distribution. Modifying a few files in the process and creating Version 2.3. The only LNP Member contributing to the Blueprints in this era was BeauBouchard. The Community Blueprints stayed a part of the different incarnations of LNPs across all platforms. Up to the time of DF 47.05.
