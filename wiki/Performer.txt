[[File:perform_icon_large.png|right]]'''Performer''' is an [[occupation]]. Performers will perform for idle [[visitor]]s at your fort's [[tavern]]s and [[temple]]s, through such media as stories, dance, poetry, and music. You may assign any number of your fortress's [[dwarves]] to serve as performers at the tavern and temple locations, and performers from other [[civilization]]s will regularly visit your fort's taverns to entertain taverngoers or [[petition]] for long-term residency.

Performers serve little practical purpose, as they mostly just duplicate the behavior of other taverngoers, and the [[tavern keeper]] if assigned to a tavern. However, a skilled performer can significantly boost the mood of any dwarves who observe their work. Performers can take apprentices and pass on their skills to them.{{verify}}

Graphically, [[human]]s, [[elf|elves]] and [[goblin]]s that are performers will almost always be seen wearing all-black clothes. Performer dwarves, however, will have their clothing colors usually match what they actually are, rather than going by the color of an occupation.

The performance skills are:

==Types of Performances==
===Music===
There are four instrument skills: [[Keyboardist]], [[Percussionist]], [[Stringed instrumentalist]], [[Wind instrumentalist]] and also one general skill, [[Musician]] (and eventhough not displayed in game, for each instrument (of every instrument type) there is a seperate skill (with level)). Furthermore there is with [[Singer]] one skill for chanting/singing.

Most musical forms are generated during world-gen, but can also be composed during adventure mode. The musical forms generated/created during world-gen can furthermore be divided in musical forms created at the beginning of the world-generation (creation), eg. in year -1, and musical forms, which are created in the further generation of the worlds history (in year 1 and later). The first type (year -1 creation) musical forms will always originate from a civilization (and have no further composer/author) mentioned and these musical forms will use only instruments from the origination civilization (everything else should be considered a bug and belongs on the bugtracker). The later type should usually have an author/composer and it is not necessarily guaranteed that these musical forms will only use instruments of one civilization. Musical forms can further be divided in improvisional and non-improvisional forms.

Musical forms typically have a minimum number of instruments (per type, including singer) and maximum number of instruments (per type, including singer) and thus a minimum number of (participating) performers needed to perform that piece of music. Furthermore each musical form has a "purpose", ie. Devotion, Military, Entertainment or Commemoration, which possibly has an influence on whether the musical form is performed in taverns or temples (further research needed).

===Poetry===
There is a [[poet]] skill.
Toady commenting on poetic forms:
<blockquote>Poetic, musical and dance forms will be generated by culture. There will be both knowledge and skill-based components to this -- so you can't compose a poem of a variety you aren't familiar with, no matter how good you are, but once you learn the rules, the quality will depend on your skills/atts. It'll start with the poet's general skill, and they'll also develop specific skill with the form...</blockquote>

===Dance===
There is a [[dancer]] skill. Dancing is initiated by musicians playing music. While one would assume a larger dance floor would increase the chances of dancing, it does the opposite.{{verify}} This is presumably a bug.

Toady commenting on dancing:
<blockquote>Every dance is associated to a musical form, and the dances respect the rhythm, tempo and some other elements of the music. I didn't reproduce the rhythm patterns below, but it tries to make elements like the number of steps in a basic movement align with the rhythm and so forth. All the forms below were generated for humanoid forms, but I'm working toward some support for varied creature bodies -- so you'll see stuff below like "left leg" even though that text doesn't appear in the dwarf raws, and you also won't see useful words like "hips" -- it's a work in progress, but it won't necessarily need to progress on that score before the release. There also aren't certain fundamentals like costumes, and I don't expect to get them in for this time. There will be some further restrictions based on entity character that aren't in yet.</blockquote>

==Performance Troupes==
Occasionally, your fortress may be visited by a ''performance troupe'', which is a collection of performers all working together. The troupe possesses a randomly generated name and often comes in groups of over five individuals, but are otherwise identical to typical performers in functionality.

== Agents ==
Note that some performers may/will be [[agent]]s of some sort. Before accepting a [[petition]] from one to permanently join your fortress population, check their [[skill]]s - if their "performing skills" are absent or sketchy, and especially if they're noticeably lower than certain other [[Skill#Professions|miscellaneous social skills]] such as [[schemer]] or [[persuader]], it may not be worth the risk.  More immediate [[unfortunate accident|solutions]] are, of course, up to you.

==Bugs==
*Performance troupes are often completely nude.{{Bug|9234}}
