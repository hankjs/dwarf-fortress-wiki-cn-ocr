'''Sheets''' are used in the production of [[scroll]]s and [[quire]]s. They can be made from either paper or parchment, and are stored under Sheet (top [[stockpile]] category).

Sheets have [[quality]] levels, which don't seem to affect the [[value]] of resulting books, however.{{verify|true at least for parchment in v47.05}}

For more information, see: [[Paper industry]].

==Paper==
Paper is made from [[plant fiber]]s mashed into [[slurry]] (at a [[quern]]/[[millstone]]) and then pressed on a [[screw press]].
Both of these actions use the [[papermaking]] labor.

== Papyrus ==
Papyrus sheets are made directly from the [[papyrus sedge]] plant (which grows in any [[tropical]] [[wetland]]) at a [[farmer's workshop]].  Note that the simple term "papyrus" can refer to ''either'' the plant ''or'' the paper.

==Parchment==
Parchment is made from [[skin]] and [[milk of lime]] at a [[tanner's shop]], and has a value of 50☼. Parchment made from the [[skin]] of a [[cow]] is called vellum.
