'''Spider monkeys''' are rare [[creature]]s found in [[tropical]] broadleaf [[forest]]s, where they appear in loose groups of anywhere between 1-6 individuals. These small primates are less than a sixth of a [[dwarf]]'s size, which, combined with their benign demeanor, makes them harmless to all but the most unlucky of creatures. All spider monkeys are born with Legendary [[skill]] in [[Climber|climbing]]. Despite some dwarves liking them for their ''prehensile tails'', spider monkey tails cannot grasp objects.

Spider monkeys can be captured in [[cage]] [[trap]]s and [[Animal trainer|trained]] into low-value exotic [[pet]]s. Their small size means they give little returns when [[butcher]]ed, which combined with their low frequency rate makes them poor choices for livestock. Spider monkeys take 3 years to reach maturity, but are fully grown by the age of 2.

Some dwarves [[Preferences|like]] spider monkeys for their ''long arms'' and their ''prehensile tails''.
