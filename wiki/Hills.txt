'''Hills''' are a landform characterized by moderate rainfall and high drainage.
Unlike [[mountain]]s, hills can have one or more [[soil]] layers along with moderate amounts of [[Crops|vegetation]] and [[tree]]s. They are not a [[biome]] as such. Depending on other factors, they can be a subtype of [[shrubland]], [[savanna]], and/or [[grassland]], with the appropriate flora and fauna.
