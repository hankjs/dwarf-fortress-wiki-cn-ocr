'''Cod''' are medium-sized [[Creature#Aquatic|fish]] found in arctic and temperate oceans. Large groups of 10-15 cod can appear on the map at once.

Cod produce a fair amount of food, but your [[Fisherdwarf|fisherdwarves]] can only catch [[vermin]] fish. You can create a [[drowning chamber]] to get their remains, or if you want a live one, you can place [[cage trap]]s in your chamber before refilling it with water. [[Captured live fish|Capturing them]] with a [[fishery]] will not work, as that too is restricted to vermin. They have a high [[Pet#Pet_value|pet value]] of 200, but this is pointless, as your dwarves can't tame them. Regardless, when you do catch one in a cage, be warned that transferring them to an [[aquarium]] may cause them to instantly air-drown.{{Bug|1590}}

Some dwarves [[Preference|like]] cod for their ''fins''.
