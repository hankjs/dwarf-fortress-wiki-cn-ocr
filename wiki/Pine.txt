'''Pine trees''' are a type of [[above ground]] [[tree]] that can be found in any coniferous [[forest]]. Like the overwhelming majority of overland trees, pine [[wood]] is brown and produces brown products. Logs can be processed in a [[dyer's shop]] into beige [[dye]].

Some [[Dwarf|dwarves]] [[Preferences|like]] pines for their ''cones'' and their ''needles''.
