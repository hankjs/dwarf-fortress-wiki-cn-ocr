'''Walrus men''' are [[animal people]] versions of the common [[walrus]], who can be found in [[savage]] [[arctic]] [[ocean]]s. They spawn in groups of 1-5 individuals and are generally content to keep to themselves, but if provoked, will trounce any unarmed peasant who angers them. In terms of size, they are 13 times the size of a [[dwarf]], and as such should only be engaged by an equipped [[military]] [[squad]].

Like other savage animal people, they can join [[civilization]]s, become [[historical figure]]s, appear as [[visitor]]s and be playable in [[adventurer mode]].

Some dwarves [[Preferences|like]] walrus men for their ''tusks'' and their ''whiskers''.

<!-- Reference: "Don't Starve" video game -->
There have been groups of human deserters who have reported seeing walrus men wearing kilts, who were out hunting with [[Blowdart|blowdarts]] during the cold winter days and staying in igloos during the night. Due to the lack of records on walrus man housing and the circumstances the humans were in, these stories should be taken with a grain of salt. 

<!-- Reference: "World Of Warcraft" video game-->
Walrus men are known for setting up settlements in area's full of [[Undead]] or [[Dragon|Dragons]] despite the apparent danger. They are known for inviting other races to have soup with them and have a habit of telling very long, boring, and uninteresting stories.

<!-- Reference: Wilford Brimley-->
If a fortress has a high supply of [[sweet pods]] or [[dwarven sugar]], some walrus men are prone to developing a chronic [[syndrome]] that leaves them permanently [[Status|drowsy]] and dependent on [[pig]] [[anatomy#Pancreas|pancreas]]es. Walrus men thus afflicted will cease all labors and spend all their time using their [[Persuader]] skill to warn other dwarves of this syndrome, delivering impassioned lectures about the dangers of [[dwarven syrup]] consumption. They will also consume only [[cave wheat]] and [[quarry bush leaves]] foods, despite their [[Preferences|dispreference]] for them, leading to negative [[thought]]s.
