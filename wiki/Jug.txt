'''Jugs''' are a type of [[Storage|container]], made from [[ceramic]] at a [[kiln]], [[metal]] at a [[forge]], [[glass]] at a [[glass furnace]], stone by a [[stone crafter]] at a [[craftsdwarf's workshop]], or [[wood]] at a [[craftsdwarf's workshop]]. They are used in [[Beekeeping industry|beekeeping]] to store [[royal jelly]] or at a [[screw press]] to store [[honey]] or [[oil]]. Jugs made from [[earthenware]] need to be [[glaze]]d before they can be used to hold [[liquid]]s like honey. Jugs are stored in the [[tool|Tools]] section of the Finished Goods stockpile, and managed from the '''tools''' section of the Stocks screen. Even when filled with food, they will be stored in the Finished Goods stockpile. Jugs are stacked in [[bin]]s. 

Jugs can be used in [[adventurer mode]] to store water like a [[waterskin]], storing 16 units of water. Jugs that are made of [[Cloth|cloth and wool]], despite not being possible to craft in [[fortress mode]], can be purchased at the equipment preparation phase of adventure mode.

== Forging and Melting ==

* Metal jugs cost '''one''' [[metal]] bar or '''one''' [[adamantine]] wafer to forge.

* When a jug is melted down, it will return '''0.3''' metal bars/adamantine wafers for an efficiency of '''30%'''
