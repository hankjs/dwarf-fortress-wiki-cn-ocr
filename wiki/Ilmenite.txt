'''Ilmenite''' is an unremarkable stone that can be found in small quantities within [[gabbro]] and [[orthoclase]]. It is magma-safe, similarly to gabbro itself.

In the real world, ilmenite is often mined for production of titanium dioxide, a common white pigment. It can also be used as a source of [[iron]].
