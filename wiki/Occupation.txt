'''Occupations''' are positions in certain [[location]]s that can be assigned to dwarves. To assign a dwarf to an occupation, select the [[zone]] (either via {{Menu icon|z}} '''zones''' and selecting the the zone, or from the {{Menu icon|P}} '''place information menu''' ) and then view the locations details with [[File:Ui location details.png]]. You will see a list of available occupations in that location, and can assign or remove dwarves. In the selection menu, dwarves will be ordered by skills relevant to that occupation. You can assign multiple dwarves with the same occupation at a location.
