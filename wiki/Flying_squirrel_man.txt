'''Flying squirrel men''' are [[animal people]] variants of the common [[flying squirrel]], who can be found in [[savage]] [[temperate]] [[forest]]s, spawn in groups of 3-5 individuals, and are generally content to keep to themselves. In terms of size, they are a little over half the weight of the average [[dwarf]]. They are born with Legendary [[skill]] in [[climbing]].

Like other savage animal people, they can join [[civilization]]s, become [[historical figure]]s, appear as [[visitor]]s and be playable in [[adventurer mode]].

Some dwarves [[Preferences|like]] flying squirrel men for their ''gliding'' and their ''large eyes''.

<!-- Reference: Sonic the Hedgehog franchise -->
Flying squirrel people do not have any kind of alliance with [[cv:Hedgehog man|hedgehog men]], [[cv:Fox man|fox men]] nor [[cv:Echidna_man|echidna men]], or [[cv:Armadillo_man|armadillo men]]. They also do not have any egg-shaped [[human]] rivals capable of world domination.

<!-- Reference: Rocky and Bullwinkle series -->
Despite what the artistic depictions of humans would convey, flying squirrel men are not companions of [[moose man|moose men]].
