'''Venom''' is a naturally-occurring poison that will cause a [[syndrome]] in certain creatures when certain conditions are met, typically when entering the [[blood]] via a [[serpent man]] or [[Giant cave spider|giant cave spider bite]]. It is produced by certain creatures according to their [[raw file]], and may be [[extracts|extracted]] as a [[liquid]] and stored in [[vial]]s. 

Each specific animal's venom delivers a [[Syndrome#List of syndromes|specific syndrome]], which is a known combination of [[symptom]]s, some short-term, some long-term, and some (in rare cases) permanent (aka "chronic"). Some few syndromes (such as [[gila monster]]s') are seen as mild annoyances, some (such as a [[giant desert scorpion]]s') are a death sentence, but most are a mortal threat, at least. Of the wide variety of possible symptoms, one of the mildest is [[Symptom#Nausea|nausea]] and vomiting, but even that can dehydrate a dwarf and take them out of combat while they seek to quench their thirst. The most immediately dangerous venoms cause [[Symptom#Paralysis|paralysis]], which can stop the lungs, leading to suffocation. Most any bite that causes strong [[Symptom#Pain|pain]] can in turn cause unconsciousness, leaving the victim helpless in combat, which is rarely survived.  Longer term, [[Symptom#Blisters|blisters]] can lead to deadly infections, and [[Symptom#Necrosis|necrosis]] (which causes tissue to die) of any body part can also lead to eventual death, but the usual treatment, amputation, is not much better.  Even [[Symptom#Dizziness|mild dizziness]] can be a death sentence to any dwarf who works or travels near magma, water, or long falls (and do any ''not''?).  There are few venoms that ''can't'' kill an unlucky dwarf, one way or the other; if your fortress has many venomous creatures nearby, have some [[coffin]]s ready.

Currently, it is disputed whether or not venom can be administered, but it may still be purchased or sold.

Research has shown that in at least some circumstances, venom and other syndrome-inducing materials can be spattered or covered upon weapons and bolts, which may result in attacks inflicting the related syndromes. {{cite forum|106397}}

Some [[forgotten beast]]s and [[titan]]s are generated with venom, which they can inject through bites or stingers, alternatively covering their bodies entirely, or making their [[blood]] toxic.
