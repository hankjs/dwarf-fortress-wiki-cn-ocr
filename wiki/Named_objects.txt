Named objects are listed in the objects menu {{menu icon|O}} under the Named objects tab. This lists any items in your fortress that have been made a [[symbol of office]]. These are '''not''' the same as [[Legendary_artifact|artifact]]s, but artifacts may be chosen as a symbol of office. However, it seems that for the purposes of [[stockpile]] settings, any named objects will be stored as if they were artifacts. {{verify}}
