'''Giraffes''' are huge [[Creature|animals]] found in [[tropical]] [[savanna]]s and [[shrubland]]s, where they appear in herds of 3-7 individuals. They're over 16 times heavier than the average [[dwarf]], but are generally benign and timid creatures who flee rather than fight, but if they do fight, their large size can allow them to easily dispatch a lone [[hunter]] who ventures too close; in combat, their hooves and mass make a good [[natural weapon]]. A new born giraffe is called a ''calf''.

Giraffes can be captured in [[cage]] [[trap]]s and [[Animal trainer|trained]] into valuable exotic [[pet]]s. Their large size means they provide great amounts of returns when [[butcher]]ed, making them good targets for a [[meat industry]]. Products made from giraffe parts are [[item value|worth]] 5 times more than those made from common animals. They take 10 years to reach adulthood, but are fully grown by the age of 5. When trained, giraffes become [[grazer]]s, and as such they'll require a constant source of [[grass]] to survive; tree browsing has yet to be implemented, so giraffes will not deforest your surroundings, though the ability for them to browse trees is a planned feature. Giraffes are [[mount]]s and may be used against you during [[siege]]s, in which case, their large size will truly become a problem to your fortress.

Due to an error, giraffes walk far slower than they can stroll. Their strolling speed is equal to 60 kph, much greater than either their trot or canter speed. As a consequence, giraffes are very difficult to chase, as they will never get tired from maintaining this speed. They may also sneak at this speed without suffering penalty to their stealth, but will likely never abuse this in game.

Some dwarves [[Preferences|like]] giraffes for their ''long necks''.
