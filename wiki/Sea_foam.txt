'''Sea foam''' is a feature of [[Ocean|beach]] maps that is temporarily produced when ocean waves reach the shore. Depending on its density, sea foam appears as {{tile|°|7:1}}, {{tile|∞|7:1}}, or {{tile|≈|7:1}}.

In the look ({{K|k}}) view, sea foam appears in bright magenta, similar to other flows such as [[miasma]], [[mist]], and [[smoke]].
