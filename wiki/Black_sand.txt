'''Black sand''' is one of the several types of [[sand]] that can be found in [[soil layer]]s. Black sand layers occasionally contain an [[aquifer]].

It can be gathered into [[bag]]s and used for the purpose of [[glassmaking]], and also for [[farming]], just like any other [[soil]] layer.

[[wikipedia:Black sand|Black sands]] are usually made up of large quantities of [[magnetite]]. Such black sands (also known as mineral sands or iron sands) are found in various beaches via rivers from erosion and are concentrated via wave action and currents. Other types of black sand include deposits composed of [[basalt]] fragments near active volcanoes.
