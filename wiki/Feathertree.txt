The '''feather tree''' is a special [[tree]] that grows only in [[Surroundings#Good|good]]-aligned areas. Unlike other [[above ground]] trees, it yields cream-colored logs when cut down. It has feather-like "leaves", and, curiously, it yields [[egg]]s instead of fruit. Beware the [[unicorn]]s that may roam around it, or simply import it from [[Elf|elven]] [[trade|caravans]].

Featherwood is the lightest wood in the game, so it should be used for things that get hauled around very frequently, such as [[bin]]s, [[barrel]]s and [[bucket]]s, decreasing [[dwarf]] speed less as they carry these items, since they are carrying less weight. Featherwood [[shield]]s are also very effective, since a shield's weight doesn't affect its ability to block attacks; it will make a shield's secondary bash attack less effective, though. It is extremely useless for [[ammunition]] – crossbow and ballista bolts will simply glance off enemies due to them weighing almost nothing. Since damage from [[gravity|falling]] is affected by the material of the landing zone, featherwood [[floor]]s can cushion falls and prevent serious injuries.

Some dwarves [[Preferences|like]] feather trees for their ''feathery leaves''.

{{D for Dwarf}}

Observing that these so-called "trees" are covered in feathers and bear eggs instead of fruit, a growing number of dwarven [[scholar|naturalists]] are advancing the position that feather trees are more properly categorized as birds rather than plants. While not universally accepted, the proposed reclassification has gained some traction in both dwarven and human academic communities, with some recently revised bestiaries now including the species, which has been tentatively renamed the "common woody rootfowl". Elven scholars have roundly dismissed this avenue of novel scientific inquiry as a coordinated, cynically motivated effort to circumvent treaties imposing limitations on tree-felling in forests abutting traditionally elven territory.
