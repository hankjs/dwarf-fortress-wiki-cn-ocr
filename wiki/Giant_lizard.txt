'''Giant lizards''' are super-sized versions of the common [[lizard]] who inhabit most [[savage]] [[biome]]s. While their original counterparts are just [[vermin]], these [[creature]]s are over 3 times bigger than a [[dwarf]]. They are not particularly aggressive, but are not benign and will attack other creatures (including dwarves) who provoke them, potentially killing them. All giant lizards are born with Legendary [[skill]] in [[Climber|climbing]].

Giant lizards can be captured in [[cage]] [[trap]]s and [[Animal trainer|trained]] into [[pet]]s, possessing the standard giant creature pet value. They are born adults and cannot be permanently tamed. They produce an adequate amount of products when [[butcher]]ed, making them a potential food source. Unlike most reptiles, giant lizards give live birth instead of laying [[egg]]s and their offspring are born fully-sized right off the bat. Because they're very short-lived, only living 2 or 3 years at most, giant lizards bred for food should be butchered quickly before they die of old age, while the actual breeding pair will require a certain amount of micromanagement to ensure they're both alive long enough to have children. They are exotic [[mount]]s and may be witnessed being ridden by [[Elf|elves]] during [[siege]]s.

Some dwarves [[Preferences|like]] giant lizards for their ''beauty''.

In one ancient dwarven story a Giant Lizard rider is found fighting a four armed bio mechanical golem in a hamster wheel. The story and it's previous entries are not looked upon fondly by sane people.
