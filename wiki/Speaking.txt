'''Speaking''' creatures (those with the {{token|CAN_SPEAK|c}} token) are able to hold conversations with other such creatures. Adventurers from species ''without'' that token (such as e.g. a [[plump helmet man]]) will be unable to talk. [[Civilization]]s without this token will wage endless [[war]]s because their inability to speak means they can't negotiate treaties. Strangely, this token is not necessary for creatures to gain [[social skill]]s.

In fortress mode, civilized creatures can also speak in the midst of combat - you can read what they say in the combat report screen. Their dialog lines are pretty similar to those of NPCs in adventure mode ("Stop! This isn't happening!").
