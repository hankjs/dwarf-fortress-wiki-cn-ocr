'''Giant bats''' are much larger versions of the common [[bat]] who inhabit subterranean [[caverns]], inhabiting the upper layers. They are over three times the size of a [[dwarf]], being as heavy as a [[llama]], and as such they prove to be a genuine threat to civilians; while they spawn individually, giant bats can quickly fly down to an unaware dwarf and make quick work of them, or sneak through unsecured entrances and cause havoc inside of the fortress. All giant bats are born with Legendary skill in [[Climber|climbing]].

If captured by [[cage]] [[trap]]s, giant bats can be [[Animal trainer|trained]] into high-value [[pet]]s. They can also be trained into [[Hunter|hunting]] beasts, though not as war ones. Like all trained animals, they will not fly, making them a bit less useful. If a breeding pair of giant bats is captured, they can also be used in the [[meat industry]]; while they produce less [[meat]] than other "giant" creatures, giant bat [[butcher]]ing returns are [[Item value|worth]] four times as much as those of common domestic animals. Giant bats are exotic [[mount]]s and are sometimes seen being ridden by [[goblin]]s during [[siege]]s.

Giant bats are notorious for their body structure, which is based on the ''HUMANOID_NECK_FLIER'' template. This means they actually possess functional hands in their wings, which they have been at least once reported to use [http://www.bay12forums.com/smf/index.php?topic=108229.0 to wield weapons and strike people with them].

Some dwarves [[Preferences|like]] giant bats for their ''terrifying features''.
