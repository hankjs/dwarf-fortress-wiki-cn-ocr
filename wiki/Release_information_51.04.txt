{{release notes}}

''Dwarf Fortress'' v51.04 is a Steam-only patch that was released January 27, 2025 to fix Steam Workshop modding support. Thanks (and blame) go to Putnam for this release. Before this fix, users would need to manually place mods downloaded from the Steam Workshop into a "mods" folder adjacent to their ''Dwarf Fortress'' executable. The only file changed in this version is the executable binary file.
