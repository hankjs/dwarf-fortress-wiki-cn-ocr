'''Shrines''' ([[File:icon_site_shrine_titan.png]] / {{Raw Tile|Å|7:0:0}}) are a type of [[site]], functioning identically to a [[lair]]. They consist of cubic open spaces decorated with pillars, and some smoothed floors. [[Bronze colossus]]es, [[titan]]s, and sometimes also [[demon|demons]] make their homes at shrines, and will aggressively defend their territory when approached. Shrines will often be littered with the [[corpse]]s of past adventurers who tried to fight their inhabitants but failed.

A shrine can be discovered in [[adventurer mode]] either by travelling, or by asking local people about either the surrounding area, or local beasts. As you approach the site, the beast living there will charge at you the moment it notices your presence, making [[stealth]] an attractive choice when setting foot near a shrine. Becoming a [[necromancer]] and reviving the dozens, if not hundreds of corpses to do your bidding is also a wise choice, however you may be left with an army of skeletons that attack any living sapient being on sight.

They are one of the few known sites that players can [[embark]] on without third-party tools.
