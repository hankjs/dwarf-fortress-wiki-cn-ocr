''Not to be confused with the propel interaction available to [[intelligent undead]].''

'''Pushing''' is an attack used by combatants too injured to use normal attacks, or by a [[creature]] who possesses no pre-defined [[natural weapon]]s.

Examples are [[wound|spine-damaged]] dwarves who cannot otherwise attack, and [[giant grasshopper]]s who have no attacks. Pushing is always treated as a blunt attack, and, depending on the [[size]] of the creature, can be either harmless or very deadly. A push from a large creature can break [[bone]]s or [[skull]]s easily because of all the weight behind the push. [[Giant sponge]]s in particular are well-known 'push-killers', because of their great size.

Note that, despite the name, a push doesn't actually move the target creature unless they dodge out of the way, or are sent flying from it - it's treated like any other melee attack. Push attacks cannot be aimed.

== Creatures who use push attacks ==

These creatures are incapable of attacking normally, and thus will use the push attack whenever they attack in combat.
