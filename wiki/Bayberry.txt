'''Bayberry''' is one of the many genera of trees found above ground. Like the vast majority of above ground trees, bayberry [[wood]] is brown and produces brown products.

Bayberry trees bear bayberries that can be harvested by setting up a gathering [[zone]]. They can be eaten raw, cooked, or brewed into [[alcohol|bayberry wine]], so you may consider exploiting them rather than chopping them down to make [[charcoal]].

Leaves and fruits can be processed in a [[dyer's shop]] into [[dye]] - leaves for yellow and fruits for blue.

Some [[Dwarf|dwarves]] [[Preferences|like]] bayberry trees for their ''waxy berries''.
