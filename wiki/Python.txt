'''Pythons''' are solitary [[creature]]s who can be found in [[tropical]] moist broadleaf [[forest]]s. While described as "small", they are in fact the largest species of mundane snake in the game, twice the size of an [[anaconda]] and as heavy as a [[grizzly bear]]. They may attack [[Dwarf|dwarves]] or [[domestic animal]]s who provoke them, but they don't carry any [[syndrome]]s and aren't particularly aggressive. Like most other snakes in the game, they continuously grow through their entire lives, reaching their max size at the age of 20, though some pythons may die of old age as soon as they reach the age of 10.

Pythons can be captured in [[cage]] [[trap]]s and [[Animal trainer|trained]] into exotic [[pet]]s. They are born adults and as such can't be fully tamed. They provide a poor amount of returns if [[butcher]]ed, but their females are prolific [[egg]]-layers, making them a good choice for [[egg production]]. Products made from python parts are [[Item value|worth]] twice as much as those made from common animals.

Some dwarves [[Preferences|like]] pythons for their ''great size''.
