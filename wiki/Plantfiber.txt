[[File:plant_fiber_sprite_preview.png|right]]'''Plant fiber''' is a resource material that is the precursor to several useful things for running a healthy fortress. Certain plant fibers can be used by [[brewer]]s in [[still]]s to make [[alcohol]], ground up into a paste or slurry at a [[quern]] or [[mill]] for other products, or  by [[cook]]s preparing them in a [[kitchen]] to make prepared meals, but what sets plant fibers apart from other edible plants is their ability to be made into [[thread]] and ultimately [[cloth]]. Ergo, a consistent source of plant fibers is essential to a healthy [[textile industry]].

The following plants qualify as plant fiber, having {{token|THREAD|plant}} in their [[raws]]:

Ensure that at least one dwarf has the [[plant processing]] labor, then designating plants to be gathered with {{menu icon|g}} gather plants option, before designating a rectangular area to harvest by a dwarf with the Plant Gathering labor

By default, fortresses embark with [[pig tail]] seeds, which can be grown underground in soft, loamy or muddy ground. The other kinds of plant fibers can be obtained, if the corresponding plants are growing naturally above ground, by assigning a dwarf the [[plant gathering]] labor, then designating plants to be gathered in an area with {{menu icon|g}}. Alternatively, to repeatedly gather plants from a specific area, you can set up a plant gathering zone by pressing {{menu icon|z}}, selecting the desired area to be gathered from, and enabling the "[[File:Ui g.png]] Gather fruit" option - in this case, dwarves with the "plant gathering" labor automatically tend to the zone as soon as new naturally-occurring vegetation can be harvested. '''Warning!''' naturally occurring plant fibers are uncommon; you can try to scope out any of the above plants to find suitable areas to gather from, but it might be more worthwhile to wait until you can [[trading|trade]] for their seeds.

To convert plant fiber into thread, you must construct a [[farmer's workshop]] and add a "process plants" task. If there is an available plant fiber material, a dwarf with the [[plant processing]] labor assigned will take the plant fiber to the [[farmer's workshop]] and convert the plant fiber into [[thread]]. When this is done, seeds of the processed type of plant fiber are also produced, which allows you to install plant fiber- producing crops in [[farm plot]]s. Dwarves who perform this task level up their [[thresher]] skill, and gain the title of "Thresher" if it is their highest-leveled skill.
