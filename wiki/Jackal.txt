'''Jackals''' are very rare [[Creature|animals]] found in a number of [[tropical]] [[biome]]s, where they appear in groups of anywhere between 1-5 individuals. While carnivorous, jackals are half the weight of the average [[dog]] and should only be a threat to your smallest [[domestic animal]]s. They possess thick fur which provides them with increased insulation compared to most other animals. A newborn jackal is called a ''pup''.

Jackals can be captured in [[cage]] [[trap]]s and [[Animal trainer|trained]] into low-value exotic [[pet]]s. Their small size means they provide little returns when [[butcher]]ed, which combined with their rarity makes them poor targets for a [[meat industry]]. However, products made from jackal parts are [[Item value|worth]] twice more than those made from common animals.

Some dwarves [[Preferences|like]] jackals for their ''resourceful nature''.
{{D for dwarf}}
Some jackals have been seen standing on their hind legs and wielding *Ademantine* shields. Unfortunately, the only way to kill said jackals, is by shooting their hands with a very "futuristic" crossbow.
