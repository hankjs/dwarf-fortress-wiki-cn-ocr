'''Fox men''' are [[animal people]] variants of the common [[fox]], who inhabit [[savage]] [[temperate]] [[forest]]s and [[taiga]]s, spawning in groups of 2-10 individuals, and are generally content to keep to themselves. In terms of size, they are roughly half the weight of the average [[dwarf]].

Like other savage animal people, fox men can join [[civilization]]s, become historical figures, appear as [[visitor]]s and be playable in [[adventurer mode]].

Some dwarves [[Preferences|like]] fox men for their ''cunning''.

The culture of fox men places a high value on tradition, family, and national pride. Their preferred economic model is free-market capitalism, in stark contrast to the dwarves' centrally-planned economy.

They are not [[muskox man|ox men]].(an easy mistake to make if you're not paying attention.) If in doubt, ox men tend to have stronger body odor.

Fox men prefer to settle conflicts with other fox men by one on one unarmed combat on even ground. They consider conducting these duels with weapons or on ground that is not perfectly flat to be unthinkable.
