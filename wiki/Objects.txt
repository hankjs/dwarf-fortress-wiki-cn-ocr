The '''Objects status screen''' contains four tabs ([[Legendary artifact|Artifacts]], Symbols, Named objects, and [[Book|Written content]]), each of which is a list of special, named, or unique items.

Each list entry contains the following columns (from left to right):
* An image of the item.
* The [[name]] of the item and its translation.
* Buttons to go to the item's location or open its item sheet, if applicable.
* The [[entity]] that [[Claim#Artifact claim|claims]] the object, if applicable.

== Artifacts tab ==
{{main|Legendary artifact}}

== Symbols tab ==
Symbols are items given to [[Noble|nobles]] in the [[#Nobles and administrators Status Screen|Nobles and administrators]] screen. They may be [[Legendary artifact|artifacts]], or they may be other items, but will always be named (giving a noble a symbol includes naming the item if not already named).

== Named objects tab ==
This tab lists all named, non-[[Legendary artifact|artifact]] items in your fortress. This may include non-artifact items also in the Symbols Tab.

== Written content tab ==
{{main|Book}}

Written content never has a [[Claim#Artifact claim|claimant]], so the last column will be empty. Typically, the work's translated name will be the same as its original name, with a few exceptions. The list will only include original works, not copies. While the majority of written content will be [[Book#Scroll|scrolls]] and [[Book#Quire and codex|quires/codices]], other objects, such as [[Slab|slabs]] containing the [[Secret|secrets]] of [[Necromancy|life and death]] can be included.
