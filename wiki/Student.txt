===Fortress Mode===
Military dwarves watching demonstrations will gain '''Student''' experience in addition to gaining experience in [[combat skill]]s. Presumably, dwarves that are good students learn faster from these demonstrations. Scholars may also become students of other scholars in a master/apprentice relationship, see [[scholar]] for details.

The dwarf leading the demonstration gains [[teacher]] experience, which also probably affects learning rate.

[[Guildhall]] demonstrations similarly train Student skills slowly. Engineer Guildhall can also hold Studying Demonstrations, allowing a Proficient Teacher/Student to train unskilled dwarves to Proficient Student in six weeks.

===Adventure Mode===
The student skill can be raised slowly by reading certain books throughout the world. It seems books written by scholars (as opposed to necromancers) are the only ones that increase the student skill. It's currently unknown what effect (if any) a higher student skill has on gameplay in adventure mode.
