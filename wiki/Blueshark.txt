'''Blue sharks''' are [[Cartilage|cartilaginous]] [[Creature#Aquatic|fish]] that can be found in any [[ocean]] [[biome]]. As big as an [[elk]] and five times the size of an average [[dwarf]], they are a large species of aquatic carnivore that produces a decent amount of [[meat]] when [[butcher]]ed. As fully-sized creatures, they can't be fished by [[Fisherdwarf|fisherdwarves]], but can be caught with a [[drowning chamber]]. An infant blue shark is called a ''blue shark pup''.

Being cartilaginous, blue sharks won't give [[bone]]s if butchered (though they'll still provide a [[skull]]).

Some dwarves [[Preferences|like]] blue sharks for their ''coloration''.
