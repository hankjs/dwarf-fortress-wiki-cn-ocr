Previously, when you sent a [[Project:Site support|donation]] to [[Bay 12 Games]], you could choose between two rewards: a Crayon Art Reward or an ASCII Art Reward. The ASCII art was a small scene made of a few [[wikipedia:ASCII|ASCII]] characters, along with a unique story written by [[ThreeToe]] happening in the ''Dwarf Fortress'' world. Each scene had a chance to appear later in some form in one of [http://www.bay12games.com/dwarves/dev_story.html ThreeToe's Stories]. If the same donor gave more than one time, it was also possible that the bits of ASCII Art followed each other and formed a story.

Each piece of ASCII Art Reward belongs to the donor who received it, but sharing them for posterity might be a good thing.

On February 1st, 2020 they announced that they would not be doing rewards after that month.
