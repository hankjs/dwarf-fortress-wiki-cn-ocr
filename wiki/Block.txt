:''For "blocking" in combat, see [[Armor]].''

A '''block''' is a type of building material that is more architecturally efficient than its non-processed counterparts. Blocks are lighter, faster building, and more valuable. This makes blocks especially useful for large construction projects. 

[[Stone]], [[wood]], [[glass]], [[ceramic]], and [[metal]] blocks can be created respectively in a [[Stoneworker's workshop]], a [[carpenter's workshop]], a [[glass furnace]], a [[kiln]], and a [[forge]].  One stone or a wooden log can be shaped into 4 blocks, which makes them more useful for larger constructions.  All other materials only produce 1 block/task, and all blocks share the advantages in construction and value. Ceramic blocks are called "bricks", though they behave the same as all other blocks.

Blocks can be used as building materials for [[road]]s, [[bridge]]s, [[workshop]]s and [[construction]]s.  When a raw material (e.g. raw stone rock) is used instead, the game will describe the result as "rough", while buildings built from blocks are not given that adjective. Additionally, blocks are '''required''' to build [[well]]s, [[screw pump]]s, and [[ashery|asheries]]. 

Even though blocks are quite useful in terms of construction, they cannot replace other functions of the raw material. E.g: Stone blocks cannot be used for making furniture or craft goods, tools such as [[pot]]s or [[jug]]s, [[mechanism]]s, or [[catapult]] ammunition. Nor can wooden blocks be used to make furniture, craft goods, tools, siege weapon components, ballista arrowheads, or crossbow bolts, or be burned at a [[wood furnace]].  Metal blocks can't be used for [[metalsmith's forge]] jobs but '''can be melted down''' at a [[smelter]].

==Blocks vs. rocks==

The clearest distinction between a [[building]] built with [[stone|raw stone]] and a building built with a stone block is that more buildings can be built of blocks, as each stone produces 4 blocks. Note that this does not apply to [[glass]], or [[ceramic]] blocks/bricks, which are only made in sets of 1; [[metal]] blocks are also made in sets of 1, but since you get 4 bars at a time from smelting ore, the end result is equivalent to stone.

Blocks have less volume, and thus [[weight|weigh]] much less than raw forms of construction materials - stone blocks weigh only 6% as much as a raw stone, and wooden blocks weigh 12% as much as the log from which they are carved. This weight difference can dramatically reduce hauling time, especially if you are using large amounts of materials. Forming metal bars into blocks makes no difference in regards to weight.

Building a bridge out of blocks instead of rocks also '''cuts the building time by two thirds''', independent of clearing and hauling time. This difference in building time presumably extends to other buildings and constructions where you can choose between blocks and rocks. The appearance of [[bridge]]s and paved [[road]]s will be different depending on whether blocks or rocks are used. The use of blocks is indicated by the floor tile {{Tile|+|#FFF|#000}}, and the use of rocks is indicated by a rough ground tile {{Tile|≈|#FFF|#000}}.

Unlike raw stone or wood, up to 30 blocks can be stored in each [[bin]] in bar/block [[stockpile]]s, which can improve hauling time between stockpiles. A [[minecart]] can carry up to 83 blocks.

Blocks are more valuable than rocks, having a [[Value#Items with material but without quality|base value]] of 5, compared to the raw material value of 3 for stone, wood or glass, while metal bars already have a base value of 5.  This, combined with the yield of 4 blocks per stone, nets a value increase of 17 when using basic stones for blocks.

Metal ores and economic stone will still produce multiple stone blocks if cut in a mason's workshop. However, this breaks use for any purpose other than building and [[strange mood]]s, such as [[reaction]]s: blocks of [[flux]] '''cannot''' be used for making [[pig iron]] or [[steel]], nor can blocks of [[ore]] be [[smelter|smelted]] into metal (without modding reactions). Note that "filler" blocks of [[raw adamantine]] are excellent for increasing [[artifact]] value without wasting too much adamantine on legendary doors, tables, etc.
