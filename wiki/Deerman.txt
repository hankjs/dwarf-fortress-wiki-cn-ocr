'''Deer men''' are [[animal people]] variants of the common [[deer]] who can be found in [[savage]] [[temperate]] [[forest]]s and [[taiga]]s. They spawn in groups of 1-5 individuals and are generally content to keep to themselves. In terms of size, they are almost twice the weight of a [[dwarf]], leading to confrontations between them being heavily in the deer man's favor unless the dwarf is properly armored and equipped.

Like other savage animal people, they can join [[civilization]]s, become [[historical figure]]s, appear as [[visitor]]s and be playable in [[adventurer mode]].

Some dwarves [[Preferences|like]] deer men for their ''grace''.

{{D for Dwarf}}

Their deadliness and cruel nature rivals that of [[moose man|moose men]].

<!-- Reference: Deltarune -->
Some Deer Women are capable of using ice [[magic]] on [[Bluejay man|bluejay men]], but only when under the command of a [[human]] [[militia captain]].
