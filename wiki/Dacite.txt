'''Dacite''' is one of the types of [[Igneous extrusive layer|igneous extrusive]] [[stone]] that forms entire [[stone#Stones forming entire layers |layer]]s, functionally identical to [[andesite]] and [[rhyolite]]. It does, however, have a slightly different melting point, and is not [[magma safe]].

In real life, this stone is similar to [[felsite]], which is a [[Calendar|month]] representing late spring in ''Dwarf Fortress''.
