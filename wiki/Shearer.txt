'''Shearer''' is the [[skill]] associated with the shearing [[labor]]. Shearers shear the [[wool]] from creatures in a [[farmer's workshop]] using the Shear animal {{k|S}} command. The result of the action is the production of [[yarn]]. 

There are only three animals that can be sheared by dwarves: [[sheep]], [[llama]]s, and [[alpaca]]s. [[Troll]]s can also be sheared, but only by their [[goblin]] masters. Therefore, the only way to acquire troll fur is to steal it from a goblin site during a raid. [[Shearable]] animals have {{tt|[YARN]}} token under {{token|SELECT_MATERIAL|c|HAIR}} section of their RAWs. Wool can be spun into [[yarn]], which in turn can be used to make [[cloth]] at a [[loom]].

Shearable animals are ready to be sheared 300 days after shearing, as defined in raws. 

Shearer is the only skill that doesn't appear to train any [[attribute]]s.  This may be an oversight.
