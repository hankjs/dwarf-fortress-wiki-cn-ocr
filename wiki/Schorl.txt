'''Schorls''' are unremarkable low-value [[gem]]s found in [[sedimentary]] and [[metamorphic]] stone layers, as well as in [[granite]].

==In Real Life==

Also known as black tourmaline, this variety is by far the most common, constituting an estimated 95% of the world's tourmalines. It is named after the Saxony village of Schorl (curr. Zschorlau) where it was first discovered by German mineralogists.
