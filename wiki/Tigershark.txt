'''Tiger sharks''' are large [[Cartilage|cartilaginous]] [[Creature#Aquatic|fish]] that can be found in [[tropical]] [[ocean]]s. Adult tiger sharks are enormous, nearly nine times the size of an average [[dwarf]], and as such provide a great amount of [[meat]] when [[butcher]]ed. As fully-sized creatures, they can't be fished by [[Fisherdwarf|fisherdwarves]], but can be caught with a [[drowning chamber]]. An infant tiger shark is called a ''tiger shark pup''.

Being cartilaginous, tiger sharks won't give [[bone]]s if butchered (though they'll still provide a [[skull]]).

Some dwarves [[Preferences|like]] tiger sharks for their ''stripes''.
