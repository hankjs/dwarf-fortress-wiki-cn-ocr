'''Giant chipmunks''' are [[giant animal]] variants of the common [[chipmunk]], found in most [[savage]] [[temperate]] [[forest]]s. While these hulking and fluffy critters may look cute, they are also roughly the size of a [[grizzly bear]] and are not benign, meaning they make pose a threat to passing [[Dwarf|dwarves]] or livestock. It is best to approach them with an armored [[military]].

Giant chipmunks can be captured in [[cage]] [[trap]]s and [[Animal trainer|trained]] into exotic [[pet]]s, possessing the default giant animal value. They give a decent amount of returns when [[butcher]]ed. Like all giant animals, they are considered exotic [[mount]]s.

Some dwarves [[Preference|like]] giant chipmunks for their ''stripes''.
