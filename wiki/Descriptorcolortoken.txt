Tokens used to define the [[Color#Color_tokens|descriptive colors]] used in the game, by dyes, materials and tissues. Not to be confused with the game's [[color scheme]] that defines what colors are graphically shown in-game.

|-
| {{text anchor|NAME}}
| string
| {{tc|red|Required}}
| What this color will be called in-game.

|-
| {{text anchor|WORD}}
| tag
| {{tc|red|Required}}
| Associates the color with any number of [[Language token|words]]. Historical figures can be named after the color of their [[Creature token#TL_COLOR_MODIFIER|TL_COLOR_MODIFIER]]. Seems to be more notable if that description can only be a single color.

|-
| {{text anchor|RGB}}
| red:green:blue
| {{tc|red|Required}}
| Decides the exact color value of the color using the additive RGB system. This color is not shown in-game, but when a [[forgotten beast|randomly]] [[titan|generated]] [[demon|beast]] uses this color, their tile color is defined by an approximation of this{{verify}}. Each value can range from 0-255.
