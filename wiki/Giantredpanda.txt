'''Giant red pandas''' can be found in savage temperate forests and should not be ignored, even if [[gigantic panda]]s are available. They have the same great pet value (500), and suffer the same crippling dependence on [[bamboo]]. Wild giant red pandas require no food; however, when [[trained]], they subsist solely on bamboo (which generally doesn't exist in sufficient quantity to prevent starvation). Being giant animals, they provide large amounts of [[meat]], though their [[butcher]]ing products are base value. Even though they aren't trainable like gigantic pandas, a herd of giant red pandas will fetch a very good price from any caravan--assuming you can keep them alive long enough to complete the trade.
