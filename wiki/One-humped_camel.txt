'''One-humped camels''' are [[creature]]s who can be found in [[desert]]s, where they appear in groups of 3-7 individuals. They are notable for being eligible to be pack animals for [[dwarf]] and [[human]] [[merchant]]s, while not technically being full [[domestic animal]]s; this means that, during [[world generation]], [[civilization]]s may domesticate them, but are not guaranteed to. Wild camels are benign meanderers and will generally provide no threat to even the clumsiest of dwarves.

One-humped camels may be [[butcher]]ed for a good amount of returns, or assigned as fairly valuable [[pet]]s. Female one-humped camels produce [[milk]], which can be [[cook]]ed or processed into [[cheese]]. Like other herbivorous livestock, they require a sizeable [[pasture]] to survive. One-humped camel calves need two years to grow to their full adult size, and they only live for a maximum of 10-20 years.

They are not to be confused with the [[two-humped camel]], which is a completely different species, also meaning that they cannot interbreed. In real life, one-humped camels are most popularly known as dromedaries, though the name is not used in ''Dwarf Fortress''.

Some dwarves [[Preferences|like]] one-humped camels for their ''hump''.
