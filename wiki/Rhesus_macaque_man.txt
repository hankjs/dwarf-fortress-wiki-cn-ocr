'''Rhesus macaque men''' are humanoid versions of the common [[rhesus macaque]] and a [[Creature|species]] of [[animal people]], found in [[savage]] [[temperate]] [[biome]]s. They are only a little over half the size of an adult [[dwarf]], being unlikely to pose a threat to a civilian's life, though they retain their animal brethren's [[Thief|thieving]] habits; they can and will steal [[Steals food|food]] and [[Steals items|items]] in their reach, and due to being larger than a normal macaque, they may cause actual harm to dwarves who try to fight them.

Like other savage animal people, rhesus macaque men may occasionally join [[civilization]]s, becoming full-fledged citizens who may appear in your fortress as [[visitor]]s or be playable in [[adventurer mode]].

Some dwarves [[Preferences|like]] rhesus macaque men for their ''mischief''.
