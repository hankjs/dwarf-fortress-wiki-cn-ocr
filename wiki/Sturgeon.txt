'''Sturgeons''' are a species of massive [[Creature|fish]] who can be found in [[temperate]] and [[arctic]] [[ocean]]s, as well as temperate [[river]]s. At one and a half tons, they're the largest species of bony fish (fish with skeletons made of [[bone]] rather than cartilage) in the game, tied with [[hippo]]s as the largest mundane animals found in freshwater. Due to their giant size, they provide a great amount of returns when [[butcher]]ed. As non-[[vermin]] fish, sturgeons can't be fished by [[Fisherdwarf|fisherdwarves]], but can be caught with the use of a [[drowning chamber]]. Infant sturgeons are called ''sturgeon fry''.

Sturgeons are benign, but if confronted, may very easily kill a dwarf or adventurer in [[adventurer mode]].

Some dwarves [[Preferences|like]] sturgeons for their ''bony scutes''.

==Trivia==
* In real life, sturgeons are a family made up of various different species of varying sizes. The massive size of the in-game animal may indicate they are specifically based on the [[wikipedia:Beluga (sturgeon)|beluga]], the largest species of sturgeon.
