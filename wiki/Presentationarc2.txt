The '''Presentation arc''' will allow more people to get in to the game. It includes, ''"A cleaner interface and more interface and display options [that] will make the game more accessible. Better support for translations."''

To many people, Dwarf Fortress is a very difficult game to conceptualize and comprehend. The game's ASCII graphics can be bewildering to gamers who are used to playing 3D games. The complicated menus, depth of gameplay, and things to build can become overwhelming enough for a person to quit trying to figure it all out. Therefore, [[Toady One]] has comprised a list of core items, required items, and bloats for the presentation arc that would ease this and streamline the game. This includes having more sounds, (Core21), tile-set support for graphics, (Core50), a sizable game window, (Core51), an interface overhaul, (Core52), as well as many other things that would make Dwarf Fortress more accessible to new players.

== Sizable game window ==
On August 9th 2008 Dwarf fortress version v0.28.181.39f was released with the functionality that allowed a basic expansion of the 80x25 grid.
