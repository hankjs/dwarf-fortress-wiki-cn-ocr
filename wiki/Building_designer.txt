{{removed feature}}

The '''Building Designer''' [[skill]], originally enabled via the ''Architecture'' [[labor]] and associated with the ''Architect'' [[profession]], no longer exists by that name in this version of ''Dwarf Fortress'', and its role has been changed into what is now called "[[Mason]]".

In prior versions, it was used when making certain types of buildings, where higher skill levels would further increase those buildings' [[value]] by boosting their "design quality", a value which was distinct from the "construction quality" that remains.
