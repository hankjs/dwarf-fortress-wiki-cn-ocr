[[File:arrow_preview.png|right]]'''Arrows''' are a type of [[ammunition]] used with [[bow]]s. They consist of a [[wood]]en, [[bone]], or [[metal]] shaft topped with a pointed head (unlike in real life, arrows are made from only one [[material]]). Arrows are only suitable for use with bows; they cannot be fired from [[crossbow]]s. Bows aren't used much (if at all) in fortress mode since higher-[[quality]] native [[crossbow]]s and [[bolt]]s perform comparably or better. Therefore, arrows are of limited use, though they can serve as ammunition for bow-filled weapon [[trap]]s. Arrows can also be [[thrower|thrown]] or used in melee, although there are better weapons. [[Dwarf|Dwarves]] cannot craft arrows, leaving potential bowdwarves no choice but to scrounge low-[[quality]] arrows from [[invader]]s and [[caravan]]s.

As with all projectiles, arrows pierce nearly any material, and are pretty dangerous in almost any circumstance. If it doesn't break on impact, an arrow can be recovered from the ground, or the body of whatever unfortunate creature happened to make a worthwhile target.

In [[adventure mode]], [[elf]] and [[human]] players can wield bows (and therefore use arrows), while dwarven players cannot.

*If a squad is assigned multiple ammo types, dwarves with "individual choice ranged" carry the wrong type of ammo{{bug|1374}}.
