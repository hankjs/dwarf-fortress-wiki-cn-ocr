A '''kiln''' is a specialized form of [[furnace]] designed for use in the [[ceramic industry]].

==Uses==
Kilns are central to a surprisingly broad array of [[labor]]s, the most obvious of which is the making of [[pottery]] and [[clay]] goods. All clay and porcelain items are produced at a kiln. This includes [[brick]]s, [[jug]]s, [[large pot]]s, [[hive]]s, [[statue]]s, and general [[trade goods|crafts]], as well as [[instrument]]s and instrument pieces if your particular [[world gen]] happens to generate them. You can enhance the value of these [[earthenware]] products by [[glazing]] them at a kiln, though this requires [[ash]] or [[cassiterite]]. Fresh clay can be acquired for use at a kiln with the "Collect Clay" order, assuming you have [[activity zone#Clay_Collection|clay collection zones]] assigned.

Although kilns are not used in the production of [[glass]] itself, they are necessary for converting [[potash]] into [[pearlash]], a necessary ingredient for making [[clear glass|clear]] and [[crystal glass]] goods. Likewise, your [[hospital]] can benefit from a kiln's ability to turn [[gypsum]], [[alabaster]], [[selenite]], or [[satinspar]] into [[plaster powder]], though this also requires you possess an empty [[bag]] for each unit you wish to produce. If you want to make [[parchment]] for [[codex]] and [[scroll]] production, the [[calcium carbonate]] stones ([[calcite]], [[chalk]], [[limestone]], and [[marble]]) may be processed into [[quicklime]] at a kiln, though this also requires spare bags.

Each action taken at a kiln consumes one unit of [[fuel]]. The specific skill used depends on the action taken. Creating earthenware items requires the [[potter]] skill. Glazing those items instead uses the [[glazer]] skill. Producing pearlash, plaster powder, and quicklime all use [[furnace operator]]. Collecting clay can be done by any dwarf with the [[Hauling|item hauling]] labor active.

Passing dwarves may admire kilns and receive a good [[thought]]. {{verify|still true in v50 now that architecture is gone?}}

==Construction==
Kilns can be built from any [[fire-safe]] material.

The overall value of the kiln building helps determine the strength of the good thought dwarves receive when admiring it. This value is determined by the value of the material used in its construction as well as the quality of the builder's efforts.
