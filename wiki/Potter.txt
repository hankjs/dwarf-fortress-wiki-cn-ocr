[[File:Agricola-3.png|thumb|Potters using a kiln to fire or harden some clay pots.]]
'''Potter''' is the skill associated with the pottery [[labor]]. Potters make [[ceramic]] [[brick]]s, [[jug]]s, [[statue]]s, [[pot]]s, and [[finished goods|craft items]] at the [[kiln]] or [[magma kiln]].  Some [[instruments]] or instrument parts can be made with a potter, depending on world generation.   Note that using a kiln to Collect Clay requires the [[Hauling|Item Hauling]] labor, and not pottery.

The potter's [[skill|skill level]] is used to determine the [[quality]] of the created good. If a [[glaze]] is applied, it adds to the value of the final product (but [[glazing]] is a separate labor from pottery).

Potters can produce a variety of goods for a fortress as part of the [[ceramic industry]].

Exceptionally hairy potters might be able to use [[magic]].
