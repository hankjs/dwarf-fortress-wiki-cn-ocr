'''Hippos''' are large [[amphibious]] [[creature]]s who can be found in [[tropical]] [[lake]]s and [[river]]s, where they appear in clusters of 3-7 individuals. They are the largest mundane animals that may be found in freshwater, though unlike in real life, in-game hippos are benign meanderers who will rarely fight back if threatened, though they may potentially be deadly due to their large size and tendency to knock or herd [[dwarves]] into rivers. An infant hippo is known as a ''hippo calf''.

Hippos can be captured in [[cage]] [[trap]]s and [[Animal trainer|trained]] into valuable exotic [[pet]]s. Since they can become very tall and heavy (~ 1.5 tons), they are a great [[food]] source when [[butcher]]ed, and also provide [[ivory]]. They may also be a great source of occupied [[coffin]]s. Hippos take 5 years to reach their full size, considerably more than most other animals.

Some dwarves [[Preferences|like]] hippos for their ''strength''.

Some [[scholar|scholars]] question whether a hippopotamus is a hippopotamus, or just a really cool opotamus.
