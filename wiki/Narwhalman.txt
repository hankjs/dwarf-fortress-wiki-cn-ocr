'''Narwhal men''' are [[animal people]] variants of the common [[narwhal]] who can be found in [[savage]] [[arctic]] [[ocean]]s. They spawn in groups of 5-10 individuals and are generally content to keep to themselves. In terms of size, they are over ten times heavier than the average [[dwarf]].

While they can learn and are able to join [[civilization]]s, they never do so, as they are completely [[aquatic]] and cannot survive on the surface.

Some dwarves [[Preferences|like]] narwhal men for their ''horns''.

{{D for Dwarf}}
Despite rumors, narwhal women are incapable of generating forcefields.
