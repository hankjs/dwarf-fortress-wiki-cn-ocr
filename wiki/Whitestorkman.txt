'''White stork men''' are [[animal people]] variants of the common [[white stork]] who inhabit [[savage]] [[wetland]]s and [[grassland]]s. They spawn in groups of 2-5 individuals and are generally content to keep to themselves. In terms of size, they are a little over half the weight of the average [[dwarf]].

Like other savage animal people, white stork men can join [[civilization]]s, become [[historical figure]]s, appear as [[visitor]]s and be playable in [[adventurer mode]].

Some dwarves [[Preferences|like]] white stork men for their ''long necks'', their ''long legs'' and their ''long bills''.
