[[File:support_preview.png|right]]'''Supports''' are pillars built to prevent or control [[cave-in]]s. Supports connect to the tile above, the four tiles orthogonal to that tile, the four tiles orthogonal to the support itself, the tile below the support, and the four tiles orthogonal to that tile. Supports transfer ''support'' from any of their "connection" tiles to all other connection tiles. A completely unsupported support will cave in. Multiple supports can be chained together to transfer support over a long distance without creating climbing/jumping paths.

Support chains (side view)


Unlike constructed [[wall]]s, supports do ''not'' create a [[floor]] tile on the Z-level above.   Nonetheless, the square above a support ''acts'' like a floor in that it will hold up adjacent (not diagonal) floor squares.  Supports do not block movement, fluids or missile fire. Supports made of wood are vulnerable to [[fire]] and certain [[building destroyer]]s.

==Building a support==
Supports are built through the build menu ({{k|b}}-{{k|n}}-{{k|p}}) and require one [[stone]], [[log]], [[block]] or [[bar]] of any type.  Construction is done by a [[carpenter]] (for [[wood]]), [[metalsmith]] (for [[metal]]s), or [[mason]] (for [[stone]] and [[block]]s). 

Supports must be built on solid surfaces, but do not require that the floor remains after construction is complete. "Hanging" supports can be constructed by building them atop constructed walls, then removing the walls, allowing chains of supports without any walkable tiles.

==Collapsing a support==
Supports can be linked to [[mechanism]]s and collapse when [[lever|trigger]]ed, causing a cave-in if the support was the only thing preventing it. This can be used as an offensive weapon or as a useful tool for breaking through layers or damming underground pools. See [[cave-in]] for more information on using the rock itself as a tool.
