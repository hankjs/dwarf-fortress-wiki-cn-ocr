'''Harp seal men''' are [[animal people]] variants of the common [[harp seal]] who can be found in [[savage]] [[arctic]] [[ocean]]s. They spawn in groups of 3-7 individuals and are generally content to keep to themselves. In terms of size, they are almost twice the weight of the average [[dwarf]], and may pose a threat to civilians who pick fights with them.

Like other savage animal people, they can join [[civilization]]s, become [[historical figure]]s, appear as [[visitor]]s and be playable in [[adventurer mode]].

Some dwarves [[Preferences|like]] harp seal men for their ''adorable pups''.
