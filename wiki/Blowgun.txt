[[File:blowgun_sprite_preview.png|right]]
A '''blowgun''' is a ranged [[weapon]] that fires projectiles called [[blowdart]]s. Blowguns can be fired incredibly quickly, though they are not very accurate and darts are lightweight. Blowgunners with higher skill and [[Attributes#Endurance|endurance]] can shoot at higher velocities. Blowguns are relatively rare, being used primarily by subterranean [[animal people]].

As ranged weapons, blowguns use and train the [[blowgunner]] skill; as melee weapons, blowguns use and train the [[swordsdwarf]] skill, instead. Dwarves cannot normally [[forge]] blowguns nor darts, limiting supply to whatever low-[[quality]] specimens can be wrested from indigenous populations. During a [[strange mood]], however, an aspiring yet misguided [[bowyer]] may create an [[artifact]] blowgun at a [[bowyer's workshop]]. Even if you do manage to get your hands on a blowgun, the severe lack of ammunition will make it nearly impossible to field an effective blowgun-dwarf. All dwarves can equip blowguns.

Units from other [[civilization]]s spawned as blowgunners are hardcoded to special behaviour. Unlike other ranged weapon users, they lack [[quiver]]s, but their ammunition will be covered in any animal [[extract]] that is available to the civilization and causes an injected or contact [[syndrome]]. Currently, it is not possible for your dwarves to add a poison or toxin to a weapon without significant workarounds (and a bit of luck), making blowguns even more underwhelming.

==Bugs==
* If a squad is assigned multiple ammo types, dwarves with "individual choice ranged" may carry the wrong ammo{{bug|1374}}.
