'''Tea''' is one of the many genera of [[tree]]s (''or as it were in this case, shrubs/bushes; see [[banana]]'') found above ground. Like the vast majority of above ground trees, tea [[wood]] is brown and produces brown products.

Unfortunately, there is no current way to make tea out of the fallen leaves. But they can be processed in a [[dyer's shop]] into tan [[dye]].

Some [[Dwarf|dwarves]] [[Preferences|like]] tea trees for their ''leaves''.
