[[File:furniture_sprites_preview.png|right]]The game's definition of '''furniture''' differs somewhat from what one might expect, and can vary depending on which menu you are looking at. The most blunt definition is "anything that goes on a furniture [[stockpile]]". Elaborating from that, furniture is something that 

*a building or construction can be made of: ([[quern]]s, [[grate]]s, [[mechanism]]s..)
*is part of a building (mostly [[workshop]]s, but also e.g. a [[well]]): ([[bucket]]s, [[barrel]]s, [[anvil]]s..)
*can be "built" from the {{Menu icon|b}} build menu (and thus be placed in your fortress), including most "proper" furniture like [[bed]]s, [[table]]s, and [[chair]]s, but also [[window]]s, [[millstone]]s and [[coffin]]s, among others (including gem windows).

For completeness, and to further complicate matters, there are also a few items that are made from the furniture submenu of the [[metalsmith's forge]], but don't go in a furniture stockpile:

* [[chain]]s
* [[cage]]s
* [[pipe section]]s
* [[animal trap]]s
* [[block]]s

Several furniture items have additional functions, like buckets (transporting [[water]]) and barrels (containing [[booze]] and [[food]]).

An important exception to the above is [[bin]]s, whose sole (but much-needed) purpose is to increase the capacity of [[stockpile]]s, reducing [[clutter]] and hauling.

== Creation ==
Furniture can be created at a variety of [[workshop]]s. All furniture has a practical use in your fortress, though it is sometimes limited to looking nice (like [[statue]]s). Dwarves get good [[thoughts]] when admiring high-[[quality]] furniture.

When starting a fortress, most furniture will usually be made in your [[Mason's workshop|Stoneworker's Workshop]] and [[Carpenter's workshop]], depending on the materials used. You can also make furniture out of [[metal]] at a [[Metalsmith's forge]], or [[glass]] at a [[Glass furnace]], but these usually consume rarer and more valuable materials and fuel. Some furniture can only be made from certain materials. For example, [[bed]]s can only be made of [[wood]]. A few unusual types of furniture are made elsewhere, like [[mechanism]]s, [[traction bench]]es, [[siege engine]] parts, and [[large pot]]s

Furniture is produced at a workshop by clicking on it then "'''Add new task'''," or through the {{Menu icon|o}} '''[[work orders|Work orders]]''' menu

The function {{Menu icon|b}} build is not only used for building workshops and the like, but also for ''placing'' items like beds, tables and chairs in your fortress. Most furniture must be placed before it can be used, but a few (like [[bin]]s, [[barrel]]s and [[bag]]s) are moved around as needed by your dwarves. As of version{{version|50.01}} bags cannot be placed as storage through the build menu.

When you try to build a bed/door/chair and it says "'''Needs bed/door/chair'''", that means none is currently available, not that there has been a problem with producing one. Usually, brand-new items are not immediately available because some dwarf has expressed the intent of carrying them to their corresponding [[stockpile]]. If it is important that the furniture be placed as quickly as possible, you can pause the game, click on item or the workshop it is in, toggle the [[forbid]] option on and off to reset any claims on the item, then designate it for building.

== Building a door from scratch ==
# Go to your [[Stoneworker's workshop]], click it and click "'''Add new task'''".
# Click "'''Make rock door'''."
# Wait for a dwarf to fetch some [[stone]] and carve it into a door. You need at least one dwarf with the [[Masonry]] [[labor]] enabled. The higher the Dwarf's mason [[skill]], the faster the door will be built (it will also be of better [[quality]]). By default, all dwarves have this labor enabled and the more skilled of them are prioritized to complete there tasks.
# Once the door is finished, go to the space you want to build the door and click the {{Menu icon|b}} build menu (icon with the hammer and three stone blocks).
# Click {{Menu icon|b|p|num=1}} "'''Doors/hatches'''." 
# Click {{Menu icon|b|p|r|num=1}} "'''Door'''." 
## If you don't care which of your doors is placed, click "'''Use closest material'''", otherwise go to the next step.
## If you wish to build more than one door, select "'''Keep building after placement'''", otherwise go to the next step.
# Click where you want to place the door.
## If you get an error message saying "'''Needs door'''," that means that the door you made is not yet available and that no other door is available. Your door may not yet be constructed or may be in the process of being stored in your furniture [[stockpile]], or the "Make rock door" job may have been cancelled for some reason (e.g. you ran out of non-[[economic stone]]).
## Alternatively, If an error message saying "'''No access to door'''" appears then there is an available door but the dwarves cannot find a path between it and the location you are trying to build it.
# You can then select which type of door to place by material, or press the dropdown next to the material to select a specific door. The doors are listed in order of distance.
# Wait for a dwarf (with the Furniture Hauling [[labor]] enabled) to come and put the door where you want it.

With the exception of [[mechanisms]] and [[traction bench]]es, every other piece of stone furniture is built the same way: [[table]]s, [[chair]]s, [[cabinet]]s and so on.

== Building a bed from scratch ==
# Go to your [[Carpenter's workshop]], click it and click "'''Add new task'''".
# Click "'''Make bed'''".
# Wait for a dwarf to get some wood and build the bed out of it. You need at least one dwarf with the [[Carpentry]] [[labor]] enabled. The higher the Dwarf's carpenter [[skill]], the better. By default, all dwarves have this labor enabled and the more skilled of them have priority for those tasks.
# Once the bed has been constructed, go to the space you want to build the bed and click {{Menu icon|b}} '''Build'''.
# Click {{Menu icon|b|f|num=1}} "'''Furniture'''." 
# Click {{Menu icon|b|f|b|num=1}} "'''Bed'''." 
## If you don't care which of your beds is placed, click "'''Use closest material'''", otherwise go to the next step.
## If you wish to build more than one bed, select "'''Keep building after placement'''", otherwise go to the next step.
# Click where you want to place the bed.
## If you get an error message saying "'''Needs bed'''," that means that the bed you made is not yet available and that no other bed is available. Your bed may not yet be constructed or may be in the process of being stored in your furniture [[stockpile]], or the "'''Make wooden bed'''" job may have been cancelled for some reason (e.g. you ran out of [[wood]]).
## Alternatively, If an error message saying "'''No access to bed'''" appears then there is an available bed but the dwarves cannot find a path between it and the location you are trying to build it
# You can then select which type of bed to place by material, or press the dropdown next to the material to select a specific bed. The beds are listed in order of distance.
# Wait for a dwarf (with the Furniture Hauling [[labor]] enabled) to come and put the bed where you want it.

Every other piece of wooden furniture is built the same way. [[Barrel]]s and [[bin]]s, in particular are useful to a growing fortress. Keeping an extra [[bucket]] around is a good idea.

== Material requirements ==
* Stone and wood furniture is made from 1 stone or log.
* Most metal furniture requires 3 bars to forge (including pipe sections), except for chains, animal traps, buckets, and blocks, which require 1.
* Glass furniture requires one bag of sand for green glass, one bag of sand plus one unit of pearlash for clear glass, and one unit of rough rock crystal plus one unit of pearlash for crystal glass.

== How do I move furniture? ==
Moving a piece of furniture is as easy as positioning it in the first place.
# Click the piece of furniture.
# Click [[File:Button remove building.png]] to designate it for removal.
# Unpause the game, and wait for a dwarf with the Furniture Hauling labor to pull it loose.
# Choose to {{Menu icon|b}} build the furniture in its new location.  You may have to wait for it to be hauled away and into a stockpile before you can do so.
# Wait for a Furniture Hauling dwarf to install the furniture once again.

Note that the Furniture Hauling labor both places furniture you choose to build at a location, and moves furniture to a designated Furniture stockpile.

== Furniture types with multiple names ==

Some types of furniture are given distinct names depending upon the material used. All such items are treated equivalently--they are built using the same menu, and they fulfill the same room requirements. For instance, a [[noble]] that requires two chests will be perfectly content with any combination of chests, coffers, and boxes, all of which are "Chests" in the build menu but are counted as "boxes" in the [[stocks]] screen.
