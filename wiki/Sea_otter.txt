'''Sea otters''' are small [[amphibious]] [[creature]]s found in [[temperate]] [[ocean]]s, where they appear in groups of 5-10 individuals. While carnivorous, they are benign and will generally not pose a threat to anything. A newborn sea otter is called a ''pup''.

Sea otters can be captured in [[cage]] [[trap]]s and [[Animal trainer|trained]] into cheap exotic [[pet]]s. Being as heavy as [[dog]]s and three times the weight of a [[river otter]], they give a decent amount of returns when [[butcher]]ed, making them a potential base for a [[meat industry]].

Some dwarves [[Preferences|like]] sea otters for their ''playfulness'', their ''fluffy faces'' and their ''simple tool use''.

{{D for Dwarf}}
Some sea otters have been reported as distracting [[human]] [[Fisher|fishers]] in order to help lost [[fish]].

[[Swordsdwarf|Swordsmen]] have been known to like sea otters for their simple tool use, particularly those who have found a career in [[Performer|performing]].
