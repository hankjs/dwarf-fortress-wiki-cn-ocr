'''Swans''' are [[creature]]s who can be found in [[temperate]] [[lake]]s and [[marsh]]es. These birds are benign and harmless to [[dwarves]] due to their small size, though [[pasture]]d animals in the surface will flee from them when they fly near the ground, leading to your dwarves to constantly have to bring them back to their pasture. Males of the species are called ''cob swans'', while females are called ''pen swans'' and hatchlings are called ''cygnets''.

Swans can be captured in [[cage]] [[trap]]s and [[Animal trainer|trained]] into low-value [[pet]]s. They're twice the size of a [[turkey]], give [[prepared organs]] when [[butcher]]ed and lay a nice amount of [[egg]]s, making them a viable target for an exotic farm.

Some dwarves [[preferences|like]] swans for their ''beauty''.
