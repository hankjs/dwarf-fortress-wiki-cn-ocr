{{D for Dwarf}} 

'''Elves''' (singular, '''Elf''') are <s>smelly, stuck-up, arrogant [[tree]]-fondling hippies</s> intelligent [[Creature|humanoids]] dedicated to the protection of ''their'' concept of nature (centered around trees, and the worship of certain natural [[force]]s that permeate the forests, as opposed to the [[deities]] worshipped by other races). They are one of the main [[civilization]]s of the game, featured in [[fortress mode]] and playable in [[adventurer mode]].

By default, they are often allies of [[dwarves]] and [[humans]], however, elves' conflicting view on nature compared to other races, can create tension between them and their erstwhile allies. Elves often prefer using grown wood (and sometimes glass) for their weapons and armor, which do very little damage and offers little protection respectively compared to metal. If you go to war with them, you'll find that their primary danger comes from their numbers, archers, and dangerous tamed animals that may [[Mount|accompany]] them.

In fortress mode, <s>hippie wagons</s> elven caravans arrive in late spring, bringing only [[plant]]s and their own "grown" [[wood]]-related items, [[cage]]d tame animals, or various types of [[clay]] and [[sand]]. When trading with elves, unless the player seeks to intentionally antagonize them, they must be very careful to not offer any wooden objects/animal-derived goods - [[#Trading|see here for specifics]]. You may also steal from them, or even kill them, without fear of immediate repercussion, as elven caravans are unguarded, and merchants will not resist if you seize their goods, or competently fight back if attacked.  

Offending elves by attempting to trade wooden items normally causes them to angrily refuse further trade that year and leave early. ''Repeatedly'' offending elves by attempting to trade wooden items may cause them to attack your fortress with an [[ambush]], which may later evolve into a full [[siege]].

Elves appear as usually thin and/or frail humanoids similar to humans, but with pointy ears, having no facial hair, but, rarely at least, stubble. Like [[goblin]]s, they are biologically [[immortal]] and will only die to violence and disease, and also similarly to goblins, this tends to result in high populations. Their life of harmony with the land and its wild beauty and creatures (due to elven civs possessing the {{token|AT_PEACE_WITH_WILDLIFE|e}} token) leads to them often settling in [[savage|high-savagery]] regions. Elves speak the [[Main:Elven language|elven language]].

Some <s>stupid, useless, tree-fondling traitors</s> ''highly misguided'' dwarves [[Preferences|like]] elves for their ''grace''.

==Fortress mode==
===Diplomats===
Once your fort has a [[baron]], elven civilizations in diplomatic contact send a [[Diplomat#Elven diplomats|diplomat]] to [[Meeting|meet]] with them approximately halfway through the first month in [[Calendar|spring]].

If this is their first visit to your fort and you aren't at war with their civilization, the diplomat will either congratulate you for your respect for the trees, or, in the more-likely event that you've cut even one down, chastise you for your disrespect. At some point, the diplomat may revisit your fortress to establish a treecutting quota, requesting that the dwarves keep the amount of trees cut down to a variable quota. It is possible to negotiate for a higher number, and the quota seems to be affected by your noble's [[Zone#Quality_and_value|office quality]], [[stress]], and [[social skill]]s. If the player agrees to a treecutting quota, it will be visible after selecting the elves in [[Civilization and World Info|the Civilizations screen]], {{k|shift-Y}}. This quota lasts until the next year's meeting, and keeping to it will improve [[Diplomacy|diplomatic relations]], while violating it will worsen them and can lead to all-out [[war]], as will rejecting a quota entirely. '''However, agreeing and sticking to a quota in one year, and then denying any agreement in the next, will keep the relationship in a state of "alliance", allowing your dwarves to raze entire forests every second year without the elves getting unhappy about it.'''

Note that the quota is measured in trees, not logs, so be sure to fell only the largest trees on your map to get the most out of your agreement. The elves also do not care if you damage saplings that haven't yet properly developed a trunk. Elves do, however, (''misguidedly enough?'')care about [[Tree#Underground trees|tree-like subterranean fungus]] like [[tower-cap]]s and [[tunnel tube]]s; cutting fungus "trees" down does count toward your quota. How many trees they will allow can be adjusted in the [[Difficulty#Tree_quota|difficulty]] [[settings]].

In addition to haggling over tree-cutting quotas, these meetings work like any other diplomatic [[meeting]]. Your [[Civilization and World Info|civilization screen]] will be updated with new info from the world, and depending on relations the diplomat may come to declare [[war]] or sue for peace.

=== Elven caravans  ===
Friendly elven civilizations send a [[caravan]] in late spring bringing a mix of natural trade goods, such as tamed animals, plant clothes, and various [[Wood#Grown_wood|grown wood]] objects.

==== Trading ====
{{main|Trading#Unacceptable items|l1=Unacceptable items}}
Elven traders are very picky about what items they will accept, and consider most items made from wood or animal byproducts to be unethical, often rejecting items merely for requiring wood or ash in their preparation. Offering them even one of these items, either in a trade or as a gift, will cause their trader to insult you and leave in a huff, ending trading for that year and damaging your diplomatic relationship with their [[civilization]]. In general, items made from [[stone]], [[metal]], [[Gem|gemstone]], non-woody [[plant]]s, or [[silk]] are acceptable, as are live animals or "grown" wooden items (generally only available from elves), but even these items can be rendered taboo with inappropriate «[[decoration]]s» or by containing or being contained in an inappropriate item.

The [[Trading]] article has specific info on [[Trading#Unacceptable items|taboo]] and [[Trading#Acceptable items|accepted]] items.

==== Stock====
[[File:grown_weapon_sprites_preview.png|thumb|142px|right|Some sprites of naturally grown elven weapons, although some standard wooden weapons will also use these sprites.]]Elven caravans will never have stone, metal, or animal products. Aside from those, you can expect an average elven caravan to have:

* [[Wood]]en [[log]]s: Always useful, unless you are in a forest [[biome]] and ''already'' drowning in wooden logs. The quantity depends on how many logs you have already: lower means more. However, caravans with grown logs tend to be rare.
* [[Plant]]-based [[food]], both from [[crop]]s and picked from [[tree]]s. These can be handy for avoiding negative [[thought]]s from eating or drinking the same old thing, or satisfying a dwarf's unusual [[preference]]. They can also be a source of [[seed]]s for your own [[Tile attributes|above-ground]] [[Farming|farm]]s, if you live in a compatible [[biome]].
* Wooden containers: [[chest]]s, [[cage]]s, [[bucket]]s, and [[barrel]]s. These are usually cheap if not decorated and useful in bulk, but even if you don't have access to wood and don't want to waste metal, there are stone, clay, and glass alternatives that you can easily make on your own.
* Soil types: [[sand]] in bags, various types of [[clay]]. Unfortunately, they don't bring enough of either for large-scale production of either [[ceramic]] or [[glass]], and neither of these are very important to have in small quantities. A bit of sand can be used to make raw glass, which is occasionally demanded by dwarves in a [[strange mood]], but other races can sell you that cheaply without needing an intervening step.
* [[Bag]]s and [[rope]]s made from plant cloth. A few extra bags never hurt, but plant cloth bags are a bit expensive.
* A few above-ground tame animals in wooden cages. It may be [[opossum|a]] [[stoat|disappointingly]] [[fox|useless]] [[hoary marmot|animal]] or [[Giant badger|an]] [[Giant tiger|incredibly]] [[Giant elephant|awesome]] [[Giant eagle|one]]. Elves bring animals from the environment surrounding their settlements, so you may be able to guess what they will bring next. Elves who live in [[Surroundings|savage]] [[Biome|tropical]] lands bring the best ones. Exotic animals are considered fully tame and will never require [[Animal trainer|training]].
* Caged tame [[vermin]]. These are only even slightly useful for pleasing dwarves with a [[preference]] for that specific type of vermin, and they may even [[Hateable|annoy other dwarves]]. The vermin itself is probably worthless, but the possibly-useful cage comes included.
* [[Plant fiber]] [[thread]], [[cloth]], and [[clothing]]. These are mainly useful for jumpstarting or replacing a [[textile industry]]. Elves wear and sell the same-sized clothing as dwarves, and may sell cosmetically-different "foreign" clothes items like turbans, skirts, or sandals.
* Plant cloth [[quiver]]s. Dwarves can't make quivers out of plant cloth, but they can easily make them out of [[leather]]. 
* Wooden [[crutch]]es and [[Health care#Splints|splint]]s. Easy to make, but just as easy to forget, and they're fairly cheap.
* Wooden [[armor]] and [[weapon]]s. This includes weapons and armor dwarves can't normally make out of wood, but wood melee weapons and armor are [[Material science#Material and item properties|basically useless in combat]]. You can use elven melee weapons to [[Training|train]] with before making proper weapons, but that's probably not worth bothering with.
* [[Bow]]s and [[arrow]]s, both made of wood. While dwarves can't make bows, it's very easy to make your own superior [[crossbow]]s and [[bolt]]s from wood, [[bone]], or [[metal]]. Bows are less dependent on material or quality than melee weapons, which makes them a bit more useful than most weapons bought from traders. Unfortunately, bows use a separate [[combat skill]] from crossbows, can't be used for [[hunting]], and leave you reliant on trade with or [[Goblinite|scavenging from]] non-dwarven civilizations for [[arrow]] ammunition. 
* Miscellaneous other [[finished goods]] made from wood or plant fiber. These might include [[instrument]]s that dwarves cannot make or copies of new [[book]]s, but other items are only marginally useful at best. Note that instrument ''parts'' are useless, since your dwarves do not know how to assemble them into a completed instrument unless they already knew how to make that instrument in the first place.

Unless you have a shortage of something, the main unique goods elves can bring are foreign plants (especially ones you can then grow yourself), foreign tame animals (especially large war-trainable carnivores), or possibly foreign instruments or new books. Everything else is relatively easy to produce on your own, and as with all traders, any dwarf with any amount of relevant crafting [[skill]] at all will make as-good- or better-[[quality]] items.

All wooden products made by elves are called "grown". Unlike regular wood, these may be traded back to the elves without repercussions; otherwise, they are identical to the wood items that you can produce.

==Ethics==
[[File:Stasost-sarasti.jpg|thumb|right|300px|Artist rendering of an elf by Mechlin ([http://www.bay12forums.com/smf/index.php?topic=169691.msg7701761#msg7701761 post])]]

Elven [[civilization]]s' [[ethics]] often differ from those of other races. Their position on moral philosophy will likely put them at odds with [[human]]s, [[goblin]]s, [[dwarf|dwarves]], and sometimes [[kobold]]s and [[animal people]], although they favor war with goblins over other races. At any given point in time, elves and dwarves are likely to be at peace, but it is certainly possible for an elven civilization to be at war with a dwarven one at the end of worldgen. Use the tab button when selecting an [[embark]] site to view whether elves are at war with the currently selected dwarven culture, and cycle dwarven cultures to find out. 

Elves are the only race which wholeheartedly accepts the devouring of enemy combatants. Looking in legends mode shows that an elven combatant will sometimes devour the other person they were fighting when they win. In spite of this, elves refuse to butcher and consume intelligent beings under other conditions. Elves find torture as an example acceptable, but condemn other forms of torture and consider torturing for information misguided. To elves, keeping any trophy of any kind is an unthinkable act. Elves begrudgingly allow for killing animals when done in self-defense, and the killing of other elves by an elf is justified if there is an extremely good reason for doing so. For elves, the killing of plants, ''especially'' trees, is unthinkable, on the other hand, the killing of neutral beings and enemies is acceptable. Elven society seems to be regulated by shame from the community, rather than by threat of punishment; as such, elves never offer serious or capital punishment to criminals; instead, elves found to have committed vandalism, trespassing or theft are reprimanded, while those convicted of treason, lying, oath-breaking, assault or participating in slavery are forced into exile.

Elves [[Personality value|value]] nature incredibly highly, and they also place a degree of value on family, eloquence, cunning, artwork, fairness, merriment, competition, and romance, but they do not especially respect commerce and have a dislike for self-control. However, even an elf will be "annoyed caught in the rain", as inconsistent as that may be.

(Note that these are merely the ethics of elven ''civilizations''. Elves may adopt the cultures of other races via wandering individuals joining civilizations, or when conquest absorbs elves into another civilization. Sentient creatures adopt the values and ethics of their culture, regardless of race. Elves living among, [[Main:Cacame Awemedinade|or even leading]], dwarves will have dwarven ethics and values, and vice versa.)

As ghastly as the concept may be, elven cultures have become more powerful since the days of [[Main:Tholtig|Tholtig Cryptbrain]], and it is entirely possible for one or more dwarven civilizations to be extinct due to elven aggression. What elves lack in engineering, crafting, intelligence, bravery, skill, or hygiene, they make up for in raw, unwashed numbers, and once-mighty dwarven civilizations may crumble to the hordes. Even more troubling is their employment of [[Mercenary|mercenaries]], often much better equipped than the elves themselves. Embarking with (possibly homeless wandering survivor) dwarves claiming to be from that civilization is possible, but always starts at war with the elves that claimed the lives of those tragically unfortunate dwarves' friends, and you may not get migrants.

==In combat==
Elves by themselves are rarely considered a threat due to their insistence in using equipment purely made out of wood in battle, which is only marginally better than fighting unarmed and generally stands no chance against a half-competent, metal-clad dwarven militia [see [[Material_science|Material science]] for more info]. However, elves will also employ [[Mercenary|mercenaries]], often much better equipped than the elves themselves. 
During [[Siege#Elven_sieges|sieges]] their archers and potential numbers (like goblins, their ageless immortality means very high populations) can still be dangerous, and perhaps the greatest threat they pose is if they bring tamed animals along with them, which may range from easily dispatched creatures to [[Giant elephant|huge]][[Tiger| sources]][[unicorn| of]][[Grizzly bear| fun]] depending upon what animals their civ has access to, which in theory can include any exotic land animal including giant variants.

==Community outlook==	
Due to ''Dwarf Fortress'' making ample use of the ''wood-elven'', or "elves as stuck-up jerks who live in trees" stereotype (which is especially noticeable when talking to their diplomats), the race as a whole tends to be widely [[Unfortunate accident|disliked]] by players, who aren't too happy about said stuck-up jerks trying to tell their dwarves how to live their lives and who will gladly ambush <s>and likely eat</s> dwarven children while they play in the woods. 
However, due to their wooden weaponry only being ''really'' effective on said children and unarmed dwarves, elves have a reputation among the community of being all-''bark''-and-no-bite wimps who serve as the perfect punching bags to be on the receiving end of whatever [[stupid dwarf trick]] the fortress is currently conducting, especially if it's a particularly [[Fun|violent]] one - many gruesome stories involve at least one elf as the victim. The elves' nigh-religious devotion to trees is also a point of note; many players will go as far as to raze their map clean of trees, for no reason but to spite the elves and provoke them into attacking, just for the chance to slaughter them all. 

Unlike many other fantasy settings, ''Dwarf Fortress'' elves have very few redeeming characteristics (they aren't any more attractive than a dwarf, human or goblin, [http://tolkiengateway.net/wiki/Celebrimbor aren't good smiths], and don't have any superhuman abilities beyond biological [[immortality]], a peculiar ability to walk through grass and other ground covering plants without disturbing them, and a (currently) off-screen ability to "shape" wood via magic - one of their few other saving graces is their potential to provide fully-tamed exotic animals for trade), though most long-time players play their antics for laughs, resulting in them essentially being the community's collective chew-toys. Many players will take on a Tolkien (''or, more likely, Warhammer Fantasy'')-esque dwarven spirit of hatred towards elves, slaughtering them for their actions against dwarven kind; or perhaps, compelled by some god of murder for the simple glee of the resulting elven blood rain. Being compared to an elf is particularly insulting, as it implies you're an unwashed, tree-loving, cannibalistic hippie (''or, as [[Dwarf#Community_outlook|some have said]], the kind of being that's prone to sitting around and living '''in''' the world, rather than acting upon it''). That's not to say that elves are universally disliked, however: some have earned the liking of the player base, typically due to them being part of a dwarven civilization (and as such, not acting like elves), with [[Main:Cacame Awemedinade|Cacame Awemedinade]] being one of the community's most well-known and beloved characters.
