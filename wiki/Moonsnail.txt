'''Moon snails''' are a species of [[hateable]] [[vermin]] found inhabiting [[temperate]] [[ocean]]s. They will cause unhappy [[thought]]s in [[Dwarf|dwarves]] who absolutely detest them should they encounter one. They possess a [[pet]] value of 10, and can not be caught in built animal traps, but can be caught with a "Capture a Live Land Animal" job, despite being aquatic. Beaches are ideal locations for catching moon snails.

Some dwarves [[Preferences|like]] moon snails for their ''predatory nature'' and their ''striking coloration''.
