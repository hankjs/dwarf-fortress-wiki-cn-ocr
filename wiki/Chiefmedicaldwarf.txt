The '''chief medical dwarf''' is an appointed [[noble]] position in charge of the [[healthcare]] of the [[fortress]]. They are in charge of the hospital, which cannot function without this position assigned.

The only relevant skill for the position is [[diagnostician]], though it is not actually necessary for a dwarf to have any medical skills to be appointed to this position, or even for them to have the diagnosis [[labor]] enabled, though one may be inclined to turn their chief medical dwarf into a doctor for practicality's sake.

Notes: 
* For more tips on healthcare, see [[healthcare]].
* The [[Noble]] position has no requirements or quirks.
* Contrary to what the name suggests, citizens of any race can be appointed to the position of chief medical ''dwarf''.
