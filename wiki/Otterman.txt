'''Otter men''' are [[animal people]] variants of the common [[river otter]] who can be found in [[savage]] [[lake]]s and [[river]]s. They spawn in groups of 5-10 individuals and are generally content to keep to themselves. In terms of size, they are over half the weight of the average [[dwarf]].

Like other savage animal people, otter men can join [[civilization]]s, become [[historical figure]]s, appear as [[visitor]]s and be playable in [[adventurer mode]].

Some dwarves [[Preferences|like]] otter men for their ''playfulness'' and their ''fluffy faces''.

Otter men are not known to be atheists, and are not at war with other atheists who are [[human]].
