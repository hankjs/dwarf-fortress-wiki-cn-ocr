'''Giant cuttlefish''' are the [[giant animal]] counterparts of the standard [[cuttlefish]], over four times heavier than the average [[dwarf]]. They are [[aquatic]] creatures that will rarely interact with land-dwelling dwarves, however they may squirt ink if threatened.

Despite their size, they apparently retain the ability to be [[cook]]ed live, assuming your dwarves can find a [[pot]] large enough. This may, however, produce significantly less food than a properly-[[butcher]]ed specimen. Because of their internal shell-like structure, giant cuttlefish produce both chitin and raw hide when butchered.

Some dwarves [[preference|enjoy]] giant cuttlefish for their ''ability to change color'' and their ''distinctive pupils''.
