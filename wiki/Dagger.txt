A '''large dagger''' is an [[attack types|edged]] [[weapon]] that is essentially larger than a knife but smaller than a [[short sword]]. Compared to the standard short sword, large daggers have no "flat" attack and a significantly less lethal "slash" attack, but gain a much more vicious "stab" attack with 1/10 the contact area of a sword point. This makes large daggers particularly effective against [[armor]]ed opponents: an iron dagger has a fair chance to pierce even [[steel]] armor, and the resulting internal injuries can be debilitating and deadly.

Large daggers use and train the [[knife user]] skill, and are common weapons for [[kobold]] and [[goblin]] thieves. As foreign weapons, dwarves cannot [[forge]] large daggers, limiting supply to whatever low-[[quality]] specimens can be scavenged from ambushers. [[Weapon#Size|Even the smallest dwarves]] are able to equip large daggers one-handed.
