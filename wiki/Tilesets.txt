'''Tilesets''' are images the game uses to display its graphics when "Use Classic ASCII Glyphs" is set to "Yes"; each tile is used to show text and represent things. Users create custom tilesets for a number of reasons, including increased visibility, aesthetics, or small size. Tilesets come in two flavors: "'''character sets'''" (or simply "tilesets") and "'''graphics sets'''". This article is only about tilesets.

== Overview ==
A character set (or 'tileset') is an image in BMP or PNG format that contains the 256 different tiles (numbered 0-255), corresponding to the [[Main:Character table|IBM Code Page 437]] (sometimes called Extended ASCII), which are used to display all graphics. The tiles are always arranged in a 16×16 grid, but its dimensions can be varied. You can have both square and non-square tiles, with 16x16 pixels being the most common size. (If "Use Classic ASCII Glyphs" is set to "No", the tileset must be 128×192 pixels (tiles 8×12 pixels) in order to render the customs tiles properly. See [[Graphic set]])

UI scaling will only work if the tileset is 128×192px (8×12px tiles). 

As the tileset is limited to only 256 tiles, some objects share the same tile. Below is a detailed list.

In previous versions of Dwarf Fortress (v0.47 and below), some of the tiles could be changed in the raws and init files, and creatures could have separate graphics (see [[DF2014:Graphic set]], this functionality has been removed in v0.50 (and above) with separate graphics being controlled by mods with "Use Classic ASCII Glyphs" set to "No".

== Installation and creation of custom tilesets ==
=== Installation ===
[[Tileset repository]] is a list of user-made standard tilesets, and provides [[Tileset_repository#Installation|installation instructions]].

=== Creating a custom tileset ===
Scaling occurs automatically based on the size of the tiles and the window. The desired grid, interface scaling and percentage settings only work properly when using 8x12 tiles, though other sizes can be used in some circumstances.

When creating a custom tileset, it's often easiest to start with an existing one, and edit it to your liking. Tilesets generally fall into two categories: rectangular tilesets and square tilesets. Rectangular tilesets have tiles that are taller than they are wide. The text in these tilesets is generally easier to read, but the map appears squished horizontally. Square tilesets usually provide more attractive graphics, but are slightly less readable. 

Mifki created a [http://mifki.com/df/fontgen/ tool] to make a tileset from any font, which can be used as starting point or as is.{{cite forum|140250}}

In ASCII mode, many tiles are used by the game in multiple ways, and this can make customizing a tileset difficult. The same character is used for chairs and the north end of one-tile-wide vertical bridges. Ashes and broken arrows look the same, and many game entities (such as levers, floodgates, bags, and bins) share characters that are also used in Dwarven names or other text in the interface.

=== Generating a custom tileset from a font in Linux ===
In Linux, it is possible to create tileset from a .ttf font programmatically in the terminal. The following command will open a terminal window with your desired font, rendered appropriately for ''Dwarf Fortress'', and screenshots it. It requires xterm, the screenshot utility xwd, and a text file containing the code page 437 characters in the appropriate order.

<pre>xterm -fa "FONTFAMILY:pixelsize:SIZE:antialias=false" -bg magenta -geometry 16x16 -e "setterm -cursor off && printf '%s' \"\$(<PATH/TO/CODE437.txt)\" && sleep 0.1 && xwd -id \$WINDOWID | xwdtopnm | pnmtopng > \"FONTFAMILY-SIZE.png\""</pre>

This will generate an image in your current directory, so it might be a good idea to cd into your /data/art directory beforehand.

'''This works ''much'' better for bitmap fonts, in their native size.''' For a list of such fonts on your system and their sizes, you can run 

<pre>fc-list :scalable=false:spacing=mono family pixelsize</pre>

=== How colors other than white and magenta work ===
When the game draws a tile, it will select a foreground color, a background color, and a tile based on the item being drawn.  The background color will be used in place of magenta (Hex code #FF00FF or RGB 255 0 255).  All other colors in the tile will be treated as a mask against the foreground color.  Pure white (#FFFFFF) will always show the foreground color, while light grey (#CCCCCC) will be a slightly darker version of the foreground color, and dark grey (#888888) will be a dark version of the foreground color.  Black (#000000) will always be black.  It is impossible to use different shades of the background color.

Alpha values are supported in png fonts (since v0.43.04), allowing for better transparency, and partial transparency, enabling anti-aliased tilesets and other interesting tricks.

In general, just remember these rules:

* Bright magenta (#FF00FF) is the background.
* Bright white (#FFFFFF) is the foreground.
* Darker shades of white and grey (#C0C0C0, #808080, etc) will display darker shades of the foreground color.  It is possible to use any shade of grey, including ones like #333333 and #C2C2C2.
* Black (#000000) will always be black.
* It's probably best to avoid color in normal tilesets.

For an example, the game is drawing an exposed turquoise cluster with color <span style="color:#00F;">bright blue</span> (#0000FF).  While loading the tile image, it encounters the color <span style="color:#CCC;">light grey</span> (#CCCCCC).  The color used in its place will be:

{| style="margin-bottom:20px; text-align:left; width:90%"

Color masks with unequal amounts of R, G and B are calculated in the same fashion.  The game is now drawing a speardwarf with color <span style="color:#C0C000;">brown</span> (#C0C000).  It encounters the color <span style="color:#008080;">cyan</span> while loading the tile (#008080).  The color used instead of cyan will be:

|}

As illustrated by this example, colors in the tileset can result in colors that aren't in the foreground color or the tile graphic.  In this case, a brown foreground color with a cyan pixel color in the tileset results in a final color of green.

Theoretically, the way the game handles color masks could be used to display different graphics for items that use the same tile (but whose respective colors use different color component channels).  For example, if a bright red object and a bright blue object use the same tile, the tile can use bright red for all pixels that only the red object uses, bright blue for all pixels only the blue object uses, and bright magenta (but NOT #FF00FF, it would have to be #FE00FE or something similar) for all pixels both objects use.  In this fashion the two objects that share a tile would look completely different.  In practice however, this is probably impossible because so many objects share the same tile, the chances of the potential foreground colors sharing a red, green, or blue color component are too great.

== What tiles are used for what ==
* Items marked with * can have their tile changed in the [[modding|raw data]] files. <small>[This list need validating for v0.50]</small>
* Items marked with <sup>#</sup> can have their tile replaced by a [[graphic set]] image, in addition to having their tile changed in the raw data.
* Items marked with <sup>$</sup> can be changed in the [[d_init.txt]] file.
* Items marked with <sup>¢</sup> use dual colors.
* Items marked with <sup>÷</sup> use inverted tile
