'''Knapper''' is a skill – currently only used in [[Adventurer mode]] – which allows an adventurer to sharpen small rocks for use as crude [[weapon]]s, materials, and [[butcher]]ing tools.

=== How to knap: ===
1.{{Adv menu icon|d}} drop anything you are holding in your hands.<br />
2.{{Adv menu icon|g}} grab two small rocks from the ground. Note that not all map tiles contain rocks, only those described as [[pebbles]], and that the type of rock varies depending on the geology of the area. If you already have rocks in your backpack, you can {{Adv menu icon|r}} remove them, putting each in a free hand. (Alternatively, you can collect many rocks, {{Adv menu icon|T}} travel to a different area and drop them on the ground, as dropped rocks can be used as if they were in your hands if you stand on the same tile as them. However, it is necessary to go to a place having a different natural rock type, as rocks dropped in an area containing the same type of rocks will simply disappear.)<br />

3.Press {{Adv menu icon|x}} to open the create menu, and select "Make sharp rock". You will be prompted to select the two rocks you are using for the task. The first rock you select is the tool stone, the rock that will be sharpened, whilst the second rock is the hammerstone, which will remain unchanged after the knapping.

Once you knap a rock, your Knapper skill will increase.
The higher your Knapper skill, the more likely you are to make sharpened rocks of a higher [[quality]].<br />
