{{distinguish|ash}}
'''Ash [[tree]]s''' are one of the many genera of above ground trees modeled in ''Dwarf Fortress''. Logs from [[wood cutter|cut]] ash trees are brown and produce brown products. Logs can be processed in a [[dyer's shop]] into goldenrod [[dye]].

Constructions and other items made from ash wood are referred to as Ashen; e.g.: -Ashen Bed-. 

Some [[Dwarf|dwarves]] [[Preferences|like]] ashes for their ''autumn coloration'' and their ''flying keys''.
