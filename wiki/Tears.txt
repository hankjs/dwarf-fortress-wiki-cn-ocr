'''Tears''' are a kind of [[contaminant]], like [[blood]] or [[vomit]], that results from creatures feeling extreme sad or joyful [[emotion]]s. The latter kind usually happens when families are reunited, or when one of your dwarves successfully makes an [[artifact]]; more often, people will begin to cry in horror when they stumble upon fighting and death.

Like any liquid, you can have your adventurer lick it to slake their thirst, but it will have little (if any) effect, and won't add to fullness.

Note that in [[Adventure mode]], your ''own'' character may begin to cry if they are horrified by what they see, even if you are responsible for the havoc.
