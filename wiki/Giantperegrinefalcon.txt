'''Giant peregrine falcons''' are enlarged [[Creature|cousins]] of the common [[peregrine falcon]], found in most [[savage]] [[biome]]s. Despite being nearly twice the size of the average [[dwarf]], these somewhat small giants are as benign as their original counterparts, spending their time diving down to kill [[vermin]] in the surface, though their larger size means they can potentially scare livestock and cause job cancellations from dwarves venturing outside. Like normal falcons, males of the species are known as giant tiercel peregrins and are significantly smaller than females. All giant peregrine falcons are born with Legendary [[skill]] in [[Climber|climbing]].

Like their small cousins, one can capture giant peregrine falcons with [[cage]] [[trap]]s and [[Animal trainer|train]] them into [[pet]]s, who possess the standard high value of a giant creature. They are not any better than normal peregrine falcons when it comes to laying [[egg]]s, though they differ for being actually useful for a [[meat industry]], being large enough to produce [[meat]], [[bone]]s and [[fat]] when [[butcher]]ed. Giant peregrine falcons are also exotic [[mount]]s, so you may see [[Elf|elves]] riding them into battle in the event of a [[siege]], which coupled with their incredible flying speed may lead to unexpected amounts of [[fun]].

Some dwarves [[Preferences|like]] giant peregrine falcons for their ''ability to dive through the air''.
