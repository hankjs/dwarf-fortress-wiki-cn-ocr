'''Density''' is a [[material]] property that, along with volume, affects the [[weight]]/mass of an object made from the [[material]].

Density influences weight, which influences how easily dwarves can carry things. Density affects the momentum of weapon attacks, but only so much; 600 density has 80% the momentum of something of infinite density, and all normal metals have significantly greater densities than this, meaning that you can usually ignore it for deciding which weapons are stronger. Density also affects fall damage. DF simulates falling by shooting the ground at you, so denser floors do more damage.
Density in ''Dwarf Fortress'' is in units of kg/m<sup>3</sup>*.

: ''(* For example, in the real world, the density of pure gold is 19.32 grams/cm<sup>3</sup>, which works out to be 19,320 kg/m<sup>3</sup>, the same numeric value as the density of DF [[gold]] (see table below).)''
== Density of some materials ==

Note that not all forms of items are the same size, and so are not comparable when considering actual [[weight]] for practical applications, such as a [[Trap#Stone-fall_trap|door prize]]. A [[stone]] (including raw ore) has a size of 100,000 cm<sup>3</sup> and a [[log]] of wood 50,000 cm<sup>3</sup>, while a [[bar]] of metal ''(or a block of stone or wood)'' have a size of only 6,000 cm<sup>3</sup>, a difference of ~16.67:1 for stone vs. metals, or ~8.33:1 for wood vs. metals. 

<!-- TABLE NEEDS A NEW COLUMN TO REFLECT THIS. CURRENT DATA IS MISLEADING w/ REGARD TO WEIGHT IN PRACTICAL APPLICATIONS.-->
