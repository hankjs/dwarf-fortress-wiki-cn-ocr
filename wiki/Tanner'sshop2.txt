A '''tanner's shop''' is used to make [[leather]] from a [[Butcher's shop|butchered]] animal skin and [[parchment]] from animal skin with [[milk of lime]]{{version|0.42.01}}.  A tanner's shop is operated by any dwarf with the 'tanning' [[labor]] enabled. A butchered animal will drop a skin that will be turned into multiple pieces of leather based on the animal's size. A cow gives 2 leather, whereas a giant elephant gives 10 leather per animal.{{version|50.01}}

'''Tanner's Shop'''

* Tan a hide.
* Make parchment.

==Notes==
*The name of this workshop will change if your fortress's primary race provides a custom value for the {{token|PROFESSION_NAME|c|TANNER}} token.
*The 'tan a hide' job is automatically triggered after the game notices that there is a skin to be tanned within a certain distance of the tanner's shop.  The player can turn off this behaviour by going into the {{menu icon|y}} Labor menu, choosing [[Standing orders]], and then turning "Automate tannery" into "Do not automate tannery".
*If you have turned Auto Tan off, your [[manager]] ({{menu icon|o}}) can manually queue "Tan a Hide" jobs. This is also useful if for some reason Auto Tan ignores a skin.
