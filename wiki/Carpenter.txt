'''Carpenters''' produce items out of [[wood]]. They construct [[bed]]s, [[bin]]s, [[barrel]]s, and all manner of other [[furniture]], as well as wooden [[training weapon]]s, [[shield]]s & [[buckler]]s, and 3 of the 5 standard [[trap component]]s. A carpenter's skill level affects the speed and [[quality]] of his work. Graphically, carpenters will appear a yellow tunic.

Carpenters are also responsible for constructing certain buildings designed with wood, wood blocks, or bars of [[soap]]. These buildings include [[trade depot]]s, [[bridge]]s,  and [[well]]s, and their building quality and value are influenced by the carpenter's skill.

To employ a carpenter, create a task at a [[carpenter's workshop]].

It is recommended that one of your [[embark]] dwarves has some skill at carpentry - [[bed]]s, [[bin]]s, and [[cage]]s are typical early necessities.
