'''Hazel''' is one of the many genera of [[tree]]s found above ground. Like the vast majority of above ground trees, hazel [[wood]] is brown and produces brown products. Logs and leaves can be processed in a [[dyer's shop]] into gold [[dye]].

Some [[Dwarf|dwarves]] [[Preferences|like]] hazel trees for their ''nuts''.
