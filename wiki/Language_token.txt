'''Language tokens''' can be used to adjust existing [[language]]s or create a whole new language. Vanilla language definitions can be found in <code>[[Game folder|<Dwarf Fortress>]]\data\vanilla\vanilla_languages\</code> within the language_*.txt raw files. Each [[token]] is permitted in a specific context.

Note: All language [[raw file]]s use [[Character table|Code Page 437]] encoding, and you should make sure you are editing these files in that format. As many text editors default to UTF-8, some characters with diacritical marks may fail to show properly. Saving one of the default language raw files in this state will overwrite these characters with the Unicode question mark, which will corrupt the file. To fix this, replace the file with a clean one downloaded from the distributed version of DF.

You can generate a language with [http://www.bay12forums.com/smf/index.php?topic=47332.0 DFLang] from a list of sample words.

You will need to update DFLang's copy of ``language_words.txt`` with the most recent version ([https://github.com/DF-Wiki/DFRawFunctions/blob/master/raws/v50/language_words.txt mirrored here]), as new words have been added since the last program release.

If you use accent marks or special characters, make sure to save your input file with Code Page 437 encoding.

[http://www.bay12forums.com/smf/index.php?topic=119625 LangCreate] is a more limited alternative, but can generate from a smaller sample.

==English instead of Dwarven language==
You can hack the language files to display English in-game with this regular expression command:

'''<nowiki>:%s/T_WORD:\([A-Z_ -]*\):[^\]]*\]/T_WORD:\1:\L\1]/</nowiki>'''

A procedural version can also be found at [[Lua scripting#Identity language]].
