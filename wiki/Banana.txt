'''Banana trees''' are one of the many genera of [[tree]]s found above ground in tropical biomes. Unlike most trees, it produces no wood (''owing to the fact that this 'tree' is, in truth, an [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Musa_(genus) overstated] [[shrub]]''), though it does produce a well-known [[fruit]] which can be eaten raw, cooked, or brewed into [[alcohol|banana beer]]. As these fruits have seeds, they are likely the lesser-known [[wikipedia:wild banana|wild banana]]. Leaves and fruits can be processed in a [[dyer's shop]] into ochre [[dye]].
