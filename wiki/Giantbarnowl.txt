'''Giant barn owls''' are [[giant animal]] versions of the common [[barn owl]], found in a variety of [[savage]] [[biome]]s. While the normal owl is as small as some species of [[vermin]], their giant cousins are about as big as [[grizzly bear]]s, though they retain the benign behavior of their normal counterparts; they spawn one at a time and do little but fly around. All giant barn owls are born with Legendary [[skill]] in [[Climber|climbing]].

Giant barn owls can be captured with [[cage]] [[trap]]s and [[Animal trainer|trained]] into [[pet]]s, possessing the standard pet value of savage giants (500). They are large enough to produce a good amount of returns when [[butcher]]ed, and can also be placed in [[nest box]]es to lay [[egg]]s, though they aren't any better than normal barn owls when it comes to egg-laying. Giant barn owls are exotic [[mount]]s and may be seen being ridden by [[Elf|elves]] during [[siege]]s.

Some [[Dwarf|dwarves]] like giant barn owls for their ''coloration''.
