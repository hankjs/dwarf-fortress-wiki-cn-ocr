'''Alder''' is one of the many genera of [[tree]]s found above ground. A deciduous [[tree]], it sheds leaves in [[calendar|autumn]], although this has no effect on the wood produced by [[wood cutting|chopping]] it down. Like the vast majority of above ground trees, alder [[wood]] is brown and produces brown products. The wood from this tree is relatively light compared to other above-ground trees, which makes it a marginally better material for hauling and a marginally worse one for [[crossbow]] melee combat and [[ballista]] ammunition. Logs can be processed in a [[dyer's shop]] into russet [[dye]], and cones can be processed into sepia dye.

Some [[Dwarf|dwarves]] [[Preferences|like]] alders for their ''autumn coloration'' and their ''catkins''.
