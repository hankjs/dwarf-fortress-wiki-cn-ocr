'''Bloodstones''' are unremarkable [[Gem#Value|low-value]] [[gem]]s found as small clusters in [[sedimentary layer]]s. Contrary to what its name implies, bloodstone is green instead of red. In the real world, bloodstone (also known as heliotrope) is a form of chalcedony, named for the inclusions of red iron oxide that resemble spots of blood.
