:''This article is about buildable containers, for all types of storage items that "contain" other items, see: [[storage]]''.

'''Containers''' is a general term used for various types of similar [[item]]s which are used for [[storage]]. Containers are named differently depending on what they are made of (see table, below), but they all fill the same function. They are a common requirement for [[noble]]s, and they are also good for increasing the [[room value|value]] of a [[zone|room]]. Each different type of container holds a varying number of items. Dwarves may walk through tiles with containers.

If a dwarf does not own a container in their [[bedroom]], they will leave any possessions on the floor. Containers are also used in [[barracks]] to store [[squad]] equipment, [[tavern|taverns]] and [[temple|temples]] to store musical instruments (and mugs for [[tavern keeper]]s), and [[library|libraries]] to store blank writing materials such as [[quire]]s. Note that a [[bookcase]] is needed for ''written'' [[book|materials]].

Containers are listed under "tools" in some menus.
