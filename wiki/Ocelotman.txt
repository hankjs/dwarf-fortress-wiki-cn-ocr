'''Ocelot men''' are [[animal people]] variants of the common [[ocelot]] who can be found in most [[savage]] [[tropical]] regions. They spawn in groups of 1-5 individuals and are generally content to keep to themselves. In terms of size, they are a little over half the weight of the average [[dwarf]].

Like other savage animal people, they can join [[civilization]]s, become [[historical figure]]s, appear as [[visitor]]s and be playable in [[adventurer mode]].

Some dwarves [[Preferences|like]] ocelot men for their ''coat patterns''.

'''Ocelot men''' are best known for their tendency to spin around while dual-wielding [[crossbow]]s. They may spawn alongside [[Snake man|Snake men]], but whether they are hostile to each other depends on the version of the game.
