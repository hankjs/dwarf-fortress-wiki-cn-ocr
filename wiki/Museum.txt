A '''museum''' is a [[room]] defined around a piece of display furniture, like a [[pedestal]] or [[display case]]. Museums can be assigned to specific dwarves, [[location]]s (such as a [[tavern]], [[temple]] or [[library]]) or left unassigned for communal enjoyment. An unassigned museum seems to function like a [[meeting hall]], where idle dwarves will congregate. Museums seem to also attract [[visitor]]s.

Museums sized as rooms count as [[sculpture garden]]s.
