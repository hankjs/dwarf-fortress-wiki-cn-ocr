'''Bone Doctor''' is the skill associated with the "setting bones" [[labor]] used in [[healthcare]], as well as the hospital [[occupation]] associated with it. Bone doctors set fractured and broken bones, then use [[splint]]s and [[plaster cast]]s to immobilize the injured body part and keep the bone in place until it fully heals. Overlapping fracture injuries require the use of [[traction bench]]es at a [[hospital]].

The Bone Doctor's [[skill|skill level]] is related to treatment outcome, as is the type of item, but not the quality. Experience can be gained by treating injured dwarves as part of the [[health care|health care industry]], or through [[scholar]]ly pursuits researching the [[topic]]. Scholars with high skill may write manuals on the topic for your library.
