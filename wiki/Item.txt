[[File:item_sprites_preview.png|right]]An '''item''' is any object that is tangible, easily movable, and not a [[creature]]. Items can include [[stone|boulders]], [[bucket]]s, [[furniture]], [[weapon]]s, [[craft]]s, and other similar or even completely different objects. Most items can be stored in [[stockpile]]s via [[hauling]], and a subset can additionally be stored in various containers, such as [[bag]]s, [[bin]]s, or [[barrel]]s. Containers are, themselves, also items.

All items have a [[Item value|value]], item type, [[material]], and volume. From these, the [[weight]] of the item can be determined. Some items additionally have a [[Item quality|quality]]. Many items can participate in [[reaction]]s, and all but the raw materials and some animal extracts are the product of a reaction.

An item can be stored on the ground, in a creature's inventory, in a container, in a workshop, [[cabinet]], or [[chest]], or even as a building material for [[building]]s and even [[construction]]s. Because of the wide variety of items and applications, there are varied ways to destroy items: waiting for [[rot]], consuming them (either through ingestion or through a reaction), [[wear]]ing them out, [[fire|burning]] them, moving them off-screen, dropping them into a [[Hell|bottomless pit]] or [[magma sea|magma flow]], crushing them in a [[cave-in]], or using a [[dwarven atom smasher]].

== Named items ==
:''See also: [[Legendary artifact]]''
An item that is named in either [[fortress mode]] or [[adventure mode]] can arise from four circumstances: being created as a [[legendary artifact]], being named for a notable [[kill list]], being chosen as a [[symbol of office]] (which makes them a [[named objects|named ''object'']]), or when created as [[book|written content]]. In fortress mode, named items will be listed their respective tabs in the Objects menu {{menu icon|O}}.

== Fortress mode ==
Items can be viewed in fortress mode from the loo{{k|k}} screen. They will, most of the time, be displayed in [[color|brown]] (yellow when highlighted as the currently active item). When selected, {{k|Enter}} can be used to view a brief description of the item, one that includes the [[weight]], contents (if any), and name of an item. From there, {{k|v}} can be used to obtain a detailed description of the item written in prose; this information includes the item type, any [[decoration]]s, and other information.

[[Caravan]]s will haul their purchases away, and [[thief|thieves]] will attempt to escape with stolen items. All creatures will leave the screen with all items in their possession, including [[weapon]]s and [[ammo]] lodged in their wounds. Using fluids or dumping into the pits [[hell|deep down]] are the only other methods of moving items off-screen.

<!-- == Adventure mode ==
Items are also tangible in adventure mode, where they are picked up with the {{k|g}} key into either a free grasp or a [[backpack]] or other suitable container. All items can be thrown with the {{k|t}} key as well. An item that is not a proper weapon can still be used in combat; the misc. object user [[skill]] is trained by this activity.

The adventurer's inventory can be viewed through the inventory screen, accessed with {{k|i}}. [[Armor]] and [[clothing]], special types of item, can be interacted with through the {{k|w}} and {{k|r}} screens. -->
== Object testing arena ==
In the [[object testing arena]], items are appointed from the creature creation screen. This is done by clicking the "Equipment" tab after a creature has been selected. There, an item is added by clicking on it at the bottom, this will add an item to the creature's inventory. The amount of items a creature is holding can be increased or decreased by clicking [[File:gui_ota_plus.png|17px]] and [[File:gui_ota_minus.png|17px]] respectively.
<!-- Items in the arena are displayed according to whether or not a creature is currently controlled; in the controlling view, the display is similar to that of adventure mode and in the non-controlling view similar to fortress mode. -->

Only certain items can be appointed in the arena. Aside from objects obtained from creatures or butchering, and their derivatives, only [[weapon]]s and training weapons, [[tool]]s, [[ammunition]], and [[armor]] can be created.
