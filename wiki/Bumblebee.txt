'''Bumblebees''' are a type of [[vermin]] found in any [[Biome|area]] that isn't freezing. They can sting a nearby [[dwarf]] without killing it, causing slight pain but no negative [[thought]] for the dwarf. They are not killed by [[cat]]s.

Bumblebees spawn from "colonies" ( [[File:bee_colony_sprite.png|21px]] ), and are one of several creatures to do so (the only other notable one being the [[honey bee]]). However, unlike the former, bumblebees can't be used for [[Beekeeping industry|beekeeping]], this being an intentional decision by [[Main:Toady One|Toady One]]. Bumblebee [[Alcohol|mead]] appears in the food stockpile along with standard honeybee mead, though it is not possible to brew it.

Some dwarves [[Preferences|like]] bumblebees for their ''woolly appearance''.

==In real life==

[https://ojs.ethnobiology.org/index.php/ebl/article/view/1383/679 Nectar collected by bumblebees] was traditionally collected by children in Scandinavian countries and termed "bumblebee honey" or "bumblebee mead"; it was used both as a food and for medicinal purposes. However, because they form annual rather than perennial colonies, they do not store the large amounts of honey that honey bees do.

<!-- Reference: "Bumblebee" character from "Transformers" franchise -->
Some bumblebees have been seen traveling with a giant red and blue robot, and often transform into muscle cars.

==Bugs==
* Bumblebee honey/mead/jelly may be preferred by some dwarves since it exists in the raws, but it isn't obtainable. Work-arounds exist in [[modding]] bumblebees to have the {{token|ARTIFICIAL_HIVEABLE}} tag, making them usable for beekeeping, or by removing their beekeeping-related materials so that they don't exist to begin with. {{Bug|4735}}
