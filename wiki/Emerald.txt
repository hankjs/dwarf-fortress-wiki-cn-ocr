'''Emeralds''' (a green form of the mineral beryl), are precious [[gem]]s, found in small [[cluster]]s within [[schist]], [[granite]], and [[marble]].  They have a value of 40, which makes them excellent trade goods or [[decoration]]s - if they do appear on the map, emeralds tend to be much more plentiful than [[faint yellow diamond|all]] [[ruby|other]] [[sapphire|gems]] of equal value; however, unlike those, emerald clusters never contain more valuable gem inclusions.

Due to the layers where they are found, they are often in small clusters adjacent to the [[magma sea]], leaving only 1 or 2 crystals far enough away from the magma to be mined.

Like all precious and rare gems, they may also make up part of the walls of [[unusual volcanic wall]]s.

Some adventurers have been known to try to use emeralds as a form of currency, though most shopkeepers insist on [[coin]]s (or simple bartering).
