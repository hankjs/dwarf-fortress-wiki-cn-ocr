'''Kea men''' are [[animal people]] variants of the common [[kea]], who inhabit most [[savage]] [[mountain]]s, [[tropical]] [[forest]]s and [[shrubland]]s. They spawn in groups of anywhere between 5-10 individuals and, just like the normal birds, will eagerly attempt to [[Thief|steal]] your [[Steals food|food]] and [[Steals items|items]]. In terms of size, they are a little over half the weight of the average [[dwarf]], which makes them fairly weak in general, but a step above the easily-killed tiny parrot. All kea men are born with Legendary [[skill]] in [[Climber|climbing]].

Like other savage animal people, kea men can join [[civilization]]s, become [[historical figure]]s, appear as [[visitor]]s and be playable in [[adventurer mode]].

Some dwarves [[Preferences|like]] kea men for their ''curiosity'' and their ''intelligence''.
