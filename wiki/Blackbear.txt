'''Black bears''' are dangerous and rare creatures that [[Thief|raid]] your [[food]] and [[alcohol|drink]] [[stockpile]]s who may be found in [[temperate]] [[forest]]s and [[taiga]]s. They are mainly a threat early in a fort's existence before defenses have been established.

In any given region, up to three black bears may appear before they become [[extinct]]. They are always solitary, and hibernate during the [[Calendar|winter]]. This makes winter a decent time to set up a bear [[trap]]: surround a small food stockpile with [[cage]] traps, and black bears will be yours, assuming it doesn't get overwhelmed by other natural thieves (like [[raccoon]]s or [[grizzly bear]]s) first. 

Black bears can be [[Animal trainer|trained]] and have a reasonably high [[pet]] value of 300. This makes them a fairly decent option for a highly rewarding breeding program: black bear parts are worth twice as much as those of more [[domestic animal]]s. However, unlike [[grizzly bear]]s, black bears cannot be trained for hunting or war without [[modding]].

Some dwarves [[Preferences|like]] black bears for their ''strength''.

{{D for Dwarf}}

Black bears are rumored to extort [[raccoon]]s who have destroyed their food supply.
