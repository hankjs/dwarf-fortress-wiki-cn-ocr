'''Longnose gars''' are a species of [[Creature|fish]] who can be found at [[temperate]] [[river]]s and [[lake]]s. They are under half the size of a [[dwarf]], and provide a small amount of returns when [[butcher]]ed. As non-[[vermin]] fish, longnose gars can't be fished by [[Fisherdwarf|fisherdwarves]], but can be caught with the use of a [[drowning chamber]]. Infant longnose gars are called ''longnose gar fry''.

Some dwarves [[Preferences|like]] longnose gars for their ''long noses''.
