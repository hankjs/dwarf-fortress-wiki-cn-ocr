'''Anole men''' are humanoid versions of the common [[anole]]; a [[Creature|species]] of [[animal people]], found in [[savage]] [[tropical]] [[forest]]s. They are a little over half the size of [[dwarf|dwarves]] when adults and spawn in groups of 1-5 individuals. They should pose no threat unless provoked. All anole men are born with Legendary [[skill]] in [[Climber|climbing]].

Like other savage animal people, anole men may occasionally join [[civilization]]s, becoming full-fledged citizens who may appear in your fortress as [[visitor]]s or be playable in [[adventurer mode]].

Some dwarves [[Preferences|like]] anole men for their ''dewlaps'' and their ''ability to change color''.
