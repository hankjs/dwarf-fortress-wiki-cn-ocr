'''Serpentine''' is a non-economic green [[stone]] found within clusters of [[olivine]]. Unlike olivine, it is not fire- or [[magma-safe]].

== In real life ==
Serpentine refers to a sub-group of closely related minerals. Within the serpentine mineral group there is the mineral chrysotile that can be processed into blueish-green asbestos, making serpentine the closest thing to [[raw adamantine]] that exists in real life.
