[[File:Crutch Self Defense.png|530px|thumb|right|Dwarves can use crutches for more than just walking.]]
'''Crutches''' are used by [[dwarf|dwarves]] to move around, when lower extremity [[Injury|injuries]] and/or neurological impairment have limited their mobility.  The associated skill is [[crutch-walker|crutch-walking]].

In fortress mode, patients who have lost the use of their legs due to short-term injuries or permanent motor nerve damage and amputation will trigger [[hospital]] staff to assign crutches as part of treatment. However, dwarves with spinal nerve injuries will not acquire and use crutches.

Crutches are made out of one [[wood]] log at the [[carpenter's workshop]] with the [[carpentry]] skill, or three [[metal]] bars at a [[forge]] using the [[blacksmith]] skill. Crutches are stored in a Finished Goods [[stockpile]], and will be placed in bins when there is space available.

Dwarves hold crutches like any other object, and may use them in self-defense. Metal crutches allow for noticeably heavier strikes in this regard, but otherwise are just extra [[weight]] compared to wooden ones.

== Adventurer mode ==

In adventurer mode, crutches can be used to walk when one or both legs are disabled. The associated skill (as above) is [[crutch-walker|crutch-walking]], and this can be trained to increase movement speed while using a crutch. It is possible to train crutch-walking without having an injury, however any adventurer carrying a crutch in their hand will have the movement penalty of using a crutch applied. Crutch-walking is only applied to walking [[gait]]s, so the skill is not used when [[swimming]], [[climber|climbing]] or crawling. It is possible to sneak while using a crutch. Crutches can be used to attack with the [[Combat_skill|Misc. object skill]] even when needed for standing support.

It is currently possible to craft crutches in adventurer mode, done by pressing {{K|b}} to construct a site, and building a carpentry workshop. Crutches can then be created by dropping a log into the workshop and pressing {{K|x}} to have your adventurer craft a crutch using carpentry - due to the current store-type imbalance in adventure mode, they may be difficult to find for sale in shops. Crutches are most easily found during exploration of mead halls, camps or other places that have loot lying around.
