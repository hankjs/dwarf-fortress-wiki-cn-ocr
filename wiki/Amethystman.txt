'''Amethyst men''' are an extremely rare type of anthropomorphic [[creature]] made of solid [[amethyst]], essentially [[gem]]stone golems, found only in the deepest [[cavern]]s. They are non-sentient, aggressive [[construct creature]]s that are not alive, [[No Pain|feel no pain]], feel no fear, [[No Stun|cannot be stunned]], [[No Exert|never get tired]], do not need to breathe, have no thought center, and are type two [[building destroyer]]s. They are as large as [[human]]s.

Amethyst men are decent fighters and will almost certainly kill unarmed civilians, as normal punches and kicks will merely glance away from their rocky hides. However, an equipped [[military]] will make short work of them, with bladed weapons like [[short sword]]s and [[battle axe]]s being preferable over [[war hammer]]s; while a hammerdwarf can bash an amethyst man until its body is fractured and crushed, an axedwarf will be able to sever their limbs much faster. If a player is feeling creative, amethyst men can also suffer from a long fall, a [[cave-in]], or [[magma]]. Upon death, they leave a rough [[amethyst]] [[gem]] usable by your [[jeweler]]s. They can't be spawned in the [[object testing arena]].

Some dwarves [[Preferences|like]] amethyst men for their ''rockiness''.

Amethyst men are known to be created in vast caverns stripped of all life, and may be found near [[pink garnet|garnet]], [[pearl]], and [[rose quartz]]. They wield amethyst-studded whips in battle.
