'''Foxes''' are small carnivores frequently found roaming through [[temperate]] [[forest]]s. They are solitary and only appear one at a time. While carnivorous, they're also benign and will generally avoid confrontation, being fairly non-threatening due to being only slightly larger than a [[cat]]. A woodsdwarf or [[miner]] armed with a [[battle axe]] or [[pick]] can easily dispatch a fox, but non-military dwarves will probably cancel their jobs and run away instead. Newborn foxes are called ''pups''.

Wild foxes can be trained by an [[animal trainer]] and kept as low-value [[pet]]s, though they cannot be further trained into war or hunting beasts. Foxes can be [[butcher]]ed for a bit of meat, but there are often better creatures to raise for a [[meat industry]]. While fox fur has notable value in real life, fox hides in ''Dwarf Fortress'' have the same default value as most other animal hides.

Some dwarves [[Preferences|like]] foxes for their ''cunning''.
