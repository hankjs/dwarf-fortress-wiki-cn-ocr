'''Giant bushtits''' are [[giant animal]] versions of common [[bushtit]]s found in [[savage]] [[temperate]] [[forest]]s. They are much more interesting than their mundane [[vermin]] basal creatures; they're quite large, growing to be slightly larger than a full-grown [[lion]], and appear in clusters of five to ten individuals.

Being large, tamable, egg-laying, breeding creatures, they are very much worth [[cage trap|capturing]] and [[animal training|taming]], and given their large cluster numbers and a bit of luck you'll be able to hook a breeding pair. With five to thirteen eggs laid per clutch, giant bushtits can be used to establish an exotic [[egg production|egg farm]]; with a very nice distribution of [[meat]] products (if without a [[item value|value multiplier]]), they can be made the basis of a strong [[meat industry]]; and with a perhaps surprisingly high [[pet]] value of 500, they can be made into excellent [[happiness]] vehicles for your fortress.

As a [[savage]] [[mount|exotic mount]] that can [[Flying|fly]], they may cause problems on the very small chance of a giant bushtit equipped elven [[siege]].

Some dwarves [[preferences|prefer]] them for their ''somewhat great size'' (offhand insult?) and ''twittering groups''. 

{{D for Dwarf}}
A little known fact to dwarves is that human men will chase these creatures to the end of the earth, seeking little else than to rub a bar of *Anaconda Soap* on them.
