'''Blood thorn''' are ghastly-looking [[tree]]s that grow only in the deepest [[cavern]] layers. They are distinguished from their peers by being the [[density|densest]] tree in the game (though [[glumprong]]s come close), being approximately half as dense as most stone, and by their unique crimson color. When [[wood cutter|cut down]], they produce extremely heavy crimson [[wood]] that cannot be found anywhere else, making for heavy but colorful furniture, and slightly less useless wooden [[ballista]] bolts. Curiously, trampled young blood thorn are ''purple'' rather than dark gray, presumably due to the plant having been "bruised" – this is in imitation of the "[[blood]]" in their name.

Among subterranean trees, blood thorn are unique in that they can grow in cavern layers that are devoid of water - when this happens, blood thorn will be the '''only''' plants present. This means that every so often, a fortress may happen to have a large stock of the tree in its caverns.

Some [[Dwarf|dwarves]] [[Preferences|like]] blood thorn for their ''sickening appearance''.
