'''Hotkeys''' are used to center the screen at a user-defined position or to follow a specific item or units. They can help you keep track of where things are. A maximum of 16 hotkeys are available to use.

For example, it would be smart to make a hotkey for a magma forge on level 122, while the rest of your fortress being on level 1 - 20. This way, you don't have to maniacally mouse wheel downward to reach your forge. Another good example is to hotkey a good mining location in the caverns.

== Zoom ==
To set a hotkey to zoom to a certain location, enter the {{k|Shift}} + {{k|h}}otkey menu at the main menu to bring up the screen. You will then see a menu with all your current hotkeys, but by default - when starting a new game - only the first hotkey, ({{k|F1}}), is set up to center on where the player's embark wagon was.

To set up a hotkey, move your screen to the location you want your hotkey to take you to, and then press the [[File:setentry_button.png]] button that corresponds to the hotkey sequence you'd like to use for that location. Any hotkey can be renamed to the player's liking. The [[File:recenter_button.png]] button can also be clicked to see which location the corresponding hotkey leads to, assuming it was set beforehand.

To use a hotkey, simply press the corresponding {{k|F1}} ... {{k|F8}} or {{k|Shift}} + {{k|F1}} ... {{k|F8}}

As mentioned before, the {{k|F1}} hotkey starts out set to the position of your [[wagon (embark)|wagon]], with the name "Wagon arrival location". All other hotkeys are unselected, and have a generic name of "Unnamed recenter location".
