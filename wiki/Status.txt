''If you are looking for the symbols that '''flash over a dwarf icon''', see [[status icon]].''

[[File:Status-bar-full.png|thumb|512px|right|Premium status bar with all food stocks categories.]]This bar shows some status information about your fortress and its residents.

==Fortress name and status==
On the left of the bar at the top of your screen is your fortress name in both the Dwarven [[language]] and English, and the classification (i.e. size) of the fortress within your [[civilization]]. Mouse-hovering over this area reveals a tooltip showing a breakdown of the fortress' [[wealth]]; this requires a [[broker]] with [[appraisal]] and is affected by [[bookkeeper|bookkeeping]] accuracy.

===Fortress wealth===
[[File:Wealth-tooltip.png|thumb|327px|right|Wealth tooltip in Premium.]]
* [[Created wealth]]. This figure is slightly misleading; it is the total value of goods that currently exists in your fortress that you have created, and that you have not exported. Presumably, this is one of the ways that the game calculates how advanced your fortress is, for determining how likely you are to receive [[immigration]], get be[[Siege|sieged]], or get better trade goods from [[Caravan|caravans]].
** Created wealth by category.
* [[Wealth#Imports and exports|Imported Wealth]] represents the total value of foreign-made goods in your fortress. Therefore, this includes the value of things such as the clothes brought in by immigrants, the equipment dropped by dead goblin invaders, and so forth. However, foreign-made goods that have been decorated, processed or consumed (such as food) do not count towards this total. Goods that are stolen (by [[Rhesus macaque|rhesus macaques]], for example) seem to count towards this total despite the fact that they are no longer on the map.
* [[Wealth#Imports and exports|Exported Wealth]] represents the total value of goods made by your fortress that you have traded to other civilizations.
A hypothetical example: You buy {{DFtext|(rope reed cloth)}} worth 50; this increases imports by 50. You then make the cloth into a {{DFtext|rope reed bag|6:0}} worth 100. This reduces imports by 50 (since it is no longer considered by the game to be foreign-made). Created wealth increases by 100. You then export the bag. Created wealth decreases by 100, and exports increase by 100.

==Population and happiness levels==
The total population and how many are at each of seven various [[stress]] levels. To see who is at which level, the [[Unit_list|Creatures]] window can be sorted by stress.

==Stocks button==
Opens the [[Stocks]] windows, also has the keyboard shortcut {{k|k}}.

==Food stocks==
This section may not display as many categories depending on the game display resolution and UI scaling [[Settings#Video|settings]].

The total amount of [[food]], [[drink]], [[seed]]s, [[meat]], [[fish]], [[plant]], and other items in your fortress. These all may have question marks until you have a [[bookkeeper]] with the [[record keeper]] skill. Depending on how many items there are, and how precise you request the counts, you will get more accurate numbers. Note that the bookkeeper will need an [[office]] to take inventory, and it will take some time. Also note that the 'Other' class includes immediately edible items (e.g. prepared meals, [[cheese]]), potentially edible items (e.g. [[flour]], [[Dwarven_syrup|syrup]]), and inedible items (e.g. [[dye]]), and is therefore an unreliable indicator of a fortress' food stores.
<!-- TODO: Include some sort of statistics as to how many units of food/drink a dwarf consumes per meal/drink/season/year/etc. -->
<!-- Isn't it "one meal" per meal, "one drink" per drink? ~~~ -->
<!-- * [[Stocks]] - The Stocks Status screen allows you to examine the number of various items that your fortress and its residents possess. -->

==Almanac==
The current weather or moon phase, [[calendar]] date, season, and world year. The tooltip listing what is in the tile the mouse pointer is at is displayed below here.
