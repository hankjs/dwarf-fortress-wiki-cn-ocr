[[File:gears2.png|thumb|270px|right|A very old-timey mechanism.]]'''Mechanisms''' can be created by a dwarf with the [[mechanics]] labor. Stone mechanisms are made at a [[mechanic's workshop]] from any type of hard [[stone]]. Mechanisms can also be made of [[metal]] (see below). Both stone and metal mechanisms use the [[Mechanic]] skill. All mechanisms are stored in a [[furniture]] stockpile.

Metal mechanisms are identical in function, and can be made at a [[metalsmith's forge]] or [[magma forge]] from 1 [[bar]] of [[metal]], the job order found under "[[trap component]]s". Mechanisms ordered via a forge can only be made with [[weapons-grade]] metals. However, using the [[work order]] menu to make metal mechanisms (either from the manager screen or from a mechanic workshop's [[workshop profile]]), a [[mechanic's workshop]] will be used instead, with the same labor and materials (but always requiring [[fuel]]), and ''any'' type of metal can be used.  Note that it is generally far more cost effective to smelt a valuable ore into 4 bars, and then make a metal mechanism from one bar of that metal, rather than make a "stone" mechanism from the raw ore.

== Uses ==
=== Buildings ===
Building [[trap]]s, [[lever]]s, [[pressure plate]]s, and [[gear assembly|gear assemblies]] requires one mechanism. Minecart [[roller]]s can require multiple mechanisms depending on length. Linking objects to a lever or pressure plate requires two mechanisms per linked item—one for the linked object, and one for the trigger (the lever or pressure plate). The only way to recover either of these mechanisms is to deconstruct the object linked via that mechanism.

When designating linkages, the <u>first</u> mechanism chosen will be attached to the building that will be activated, while the <u>second</u> will be attached to the trigger (pressure plate or lever). This can be important when trying to minimize the use of [[magma-safe]] materials in a structure that will be exposed to high [[temperature]]s.

[[Mechanic]]s will install mechanisms. Mechanisms can be linked to objects at any distance and do not require a connection between them.

Mechanisms for use next to or in magma ''must be'' magma-safe, otherwise they will be destroyed (whether by melting or by burning) and the object to which they are linked will deconstruct.

Mechanism [[quality]] determines the skill with which weapon traps swing/fire their weapons[http://www.bay12forums.com/smf/index.php?topic=14461.msg.msg131214#msg131214] and stone-fall traps drop their boulder[https://www.bay12forums.com/smf/index.php?topic=183425.msg8595312#msg8595312]. It does not affect the probability of a weapon trap jamming or how quickly a weapon trap refires. Artifact mechanisms receive the exact same bonus as masterworks.

Building a [[screw press]] [[workshop]] requires two mechanisms, and is likewise performed by any dwarf with the [[mechanic]]s labor.

=== Value ===

Mechanisms make surprisingly good [[trade]] items due to their high [[item value|base value]] of 30☼. In comparison to other [[craft]]s, they are heavy, making them less-than-ideal when trading with [[civilization|races]] that do not bring [[wagon]]s, notably the [[elf|elves]]. Levers and gear assemblies make good room decorations, as they have a greater base value than that of [[statue]]s and [[window]]s.

Mechanisms count as furniture. Because of this, the [[Jeweler's workshop]] job "encrust furniture with <gem>" may encrust mechanisms with gems instead of more useful furniture.

== Quantum entanglement ==

{{D for Dwarf}}

It is unclear exactly how two (or more) mechanisms talk to each other at a distance without building direct mechanical or electronic channels between them (such as a wire), and given that the dwarves have not discovered radio technology, it is believed by some that the dwarves have actually discovered how to implement and control [[wikipedia:quantum entanglement|quantum entanglement]] on a non-quantum scale, and somehow use it for transmitting information.

"I've always wondered," Lór said, "How do those mechanisms work?"

"Well, I put one here on the lever, and the other on the bridge," explained Urist. "When someone pulls the lever, the bridge goes up."

"Yes, but how? How does the one at the bridge know the lever's been pulled?"

"It's quantum. Quantum tanglement. See how this one's all tangled with the lever? Well, the other's tangled with the bridge."

"What does that have to do with quantum?"

"There's one of them, see? That's what quantum means, is one."

"But there's two."

"Yah, two ones. And they're tangled."

Lór thought for a moment.

"I'm not sure that's how it works."

"Well, don't check. It might stop."

Recent observational studies have given rise to new theories regarding dwarven machinery, the most notable of which being the ''Stringing [[Beard]] Theory''. Accordingly, it is asserted the dwarven beard is in fact a single long strand interwoven across the dwarf's face as if a loosely stitched thread. By plucking out this strand and tying the end to a mechanism, which resembles a sort of [[wikipedia:carabiner|carabiner]], it is believed that a dwarf is able to connect two objects by way of a long (sometimes kilometers in length) strand of beard-hair. This is done quite simply by the dwarf continually plucking more and more of its beard out as it runs from one object to the next, laying out a cable around corners, up ramps, down stairways, and through planned walls (which get built over the top of the strand anyways). When a lever is pulled, it pulls the string with it, which in turn actuates the object on the other side. When deconstructing a linked building, the dwarf need only give the strand a flick or two, then it reels in the dangling mechanism from wherever.

Given the substantial density of dwarven beards, it is plausible that even a depleted beard can be replenished by the time a beard's five-tick shadow emerges.
