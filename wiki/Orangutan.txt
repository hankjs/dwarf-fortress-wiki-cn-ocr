'''Orangutans''' are very rare and solitary [[Creature|apes]] found exclusively in [[tropical]] moist broadleaf [[forest]]s. While larger than the average [[human]], they're benign and timid by nature, and as such make easy targets for a [[Dwarf|dwarven]] [[hunter]]. All orangutans are born with Legendary [[skill]] in [[Climber|climbing]].

Orangutans can be captured in [[cage]] [[trap]]s and [[Animal trainer|trained]] into valuable exotic [[pet]]s. Due to their rarity, they make poor targets for a [[meat industry]], though they give a decent amount of returns if [[butcher]]ed. Orangutans are long-lived for animals, and they take 10 years to reach adulthood, though they're fully grown by the age of 2. Like most species of ape in the game, they aren't naturally capable of [[Swimmer|swimming]] and will likely drown if submerged in [[water]].

Some dwarves [[Preferences|like]] orangutans for their ''long arms'', their ''colourful fur'' and ''antics''.

It should be noted that some orangutans have shown extreme aggression towards dwarves who refer to them as monkeys, as they are actually apes. Also they apparently make good librarians.

Just as [[goblin|goblins]] are reviled by dwarves for kidnapping their young (among other things), human villagers are openly suspicious of any orangutan nobles snooping about - perhaps if the orangutan "civilization" had any goods to offer in trade for the invention of fire, they would be open to discuss parting with a "man-cub." Dwarves, on the other hand, would never claim to have invented fire, knowing that it is a gift of Armok; nevertheless, [[magma|lessons on the subject]] are made available to those who ask for it.

Some orangutans call themselves [[Monarch|king]], but this is rarely understood except by some [[Human|human]] [[Outsider|strays]].
