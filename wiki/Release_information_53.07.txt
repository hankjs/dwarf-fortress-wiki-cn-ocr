{{release notes}}

:Here's another patch for the Siege Update. Dwarves will now have happy thoughts to bolster them after sieges, while invader movement has been made a bit more dynamic. There are lots of new animal portraits. Hundreds of them! And the lua has been brought in line with our full set of procedural creature graphics, so forgotten beasts in new worlds should look extra fancy now.

:Hey Urists,
:This is our last Dwarf Fortress update for the year and we have patch 53.07, a list of the upcoming major features and a winter Tarn Time video. 
:So that’s all for 2025! We hope you have a relaxing Holidays and your dwarves will be nestled all snug in their beds, while visions of a fey mood dance in their heads. We’ll be back in the new year with a magical mindset!

== What's Next for Sieges? ==
The list does not include the ongoing work on bugfixes and other quality of life improvements that occur simultaneously. We don’t have specific dates or timeframes to share but you can expect a lot of things from the list to arrive in 2026. If you’d rather see the video version, skip down past the text!

Tarn writes: "Following the release of the Siege Update in November 2025, we're continuing on with a series of releases involving magic, armies, villains, site building, and maps. The first Siege Update focused on invasion planning, overcoming fortress defenses, and defensive siege engines. The second release will focus on magic, armies, and diplomacy. We've revised the list below of possible changes, none of which are guaranteed, but which we are aiming for:

=== Magic diverse enough to make sieges and siege defense more exciting ===
* Kidnapped humans and dwarves trained by demons as sorcerers
* Deity-based powers and temple ceremonies
* Other magic based on the supernatural structure of the world

=== Resident wizards ===
* Help to defend the fortress against magical sieges while you aid them in their work
* Assign assistants to work in magical workshops and to go off-site for research tasks
* Laboratory zones can incorporate lab equipment for alchemy and other magical research

=== Improved diplomacy ===
* Clean up siege negotiations
* Send messengers to other sites
* Ability to see existing petitions

=== Using outside armies ===
* Send out squads to muster armies in the hillocks
* Use scouts to receive warning before enemy armies arrive
* Engage, delay, and turn back sieging armies

=== Misc ===
* Changes to cage traps to make it more intensive but still possible to e.g. capture megabeasts
* Make megabeast and kobold attacks more functional and interesting
* Fix and improve underground civilization attacks (as far as we can without future map changes)
* Anything from Combat Flow and Combat Styles that comes up, also a notion of reach

We've promised Adventure mode site building as the first major Adventure mode feature post launch, since it used to be in the game but didn't make it in for the graphical version. This is still the plan, and we'll take care of it after Fortress mode gets some attention with the siege improvements above. In order to further motivate this for everybody, we're planning a foray into cross-mode play and Adventure mode crafting here. Details will follow as we get closer and select our direction.

Post siege improvements, we'd like to start some map rewrites and additions to get us prepared for a more magical and procedural future.

Prior to the Steam/itch work over the last years, we were working on villains, and left quite a bit of work on the table. After the siege improvements are done, and we've made some additional progress, we'll make another post to see how these additions will be incorporated.

And of course, we'd like to start bringing more and more myths and magic and world changes into the game, probably through the avenues of covens and religion, but we'll see how that develops as all of the above progresses, since it will be important to be flexible.”

== Community Requests ==
We hear you! There are many of you who have been asking for classic keyboard controls from the ascii version to make their way to Steam. We know this is important for the veterans who have developed muscle memory for the last 20 years. In order to do this we are going to move the interface elements out into lua. The expansion of lua is an ongoing project and work on interface widget luafication has already begun. But we don’t have any dates or timelines.

We also get occasional questions about the Mac port, but as we announced earlier in 2025, we have chosen to put that port on hold indefinitely. The improvements and advances made wouldn't have been possible if we had been supporting that platform.

== Tarn Time Winter 2025 ==
Tarn reflects on the siege update and outlines the features he’s excited to work on next. Watch [https://youtu.be/cbzttKQofFg here].

== Hundreds of new Animal Portraits are in! ==
Part of today’s update includes over 350 new animal and creature portraits from artist Neoriceisgood/Guido Bos. There’s lots to discover here with everything from the majestic horse to the timid fluffy wambler. We'll be chatting with Guido soon about his art and process, so comment with your question below if you have a specific curiosity!

== Bundle with Songs of Syx ==
Dwarf Fortress players can get a 10% additional discount on the newly updated fantasy city-builder Songs of Syx by picking up the bundle, on top of its current 25% off sale. This is the perfect game for Dwarf Fortress fans who want even more simulated armies and battle.
