[[File:figurine_preview.png|right]]A '''figurine''' ([[File:figurine_sprite.png]] / {{Tile|Å|7:1}})  is a [[trade good]] made at a [[craftsdwarf's workshop]] or at a [[metalsmith's forge]] under any particular category. Once queued, a figurine may be customised by pressing [[File:Mag glass icon.png]] on the task in the workshop's job list. Here, a specific player-defined image or civilisation-related artwork may be commissioned. They are like a small handheld [[statue]] in some senses.

Dwarf civilians may claim ownership of figurines, and will carry them around much like how they wear [[jewelry]]. While they use one hand to hold them, it doesn't appear to interfere with any [[job]]s requiring hands. A dwarf holding a figurine may use it for self-defense in [[combat]], making use of the [[Combat skill|Misc. Object User]] [[skill]].

On rare occasions, a gem figurine, instead of a large gem, can be made at a [[jeweler's workshop]]. Similar to [[engraving]]s, they can show historic events, depict creatures, venerate religious figures, or list something about a person the [[craftsdwarf]] knows.
