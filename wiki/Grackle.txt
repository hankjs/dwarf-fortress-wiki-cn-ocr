'''Grackles''' are a species of [[above ground]] [[vermin]], found in [[temperate]] [[grassland]]s and [[savanna]]s. They may be captured in [[animal trap]]s and turned into [[pet]]s. All grackles possess Legendary [[skill]] in [[Climber|climbing]].

Some dwarves [[Preferences|like]] grackles for their ''raucous calls''.
