'''Gray langurs''' are small, [[Thief|thieving]] [[creature]]s that can be found in almost any [[biome]], spawning in loose groups of 5-10 individuals. They will attempt to steal [[Steals food|food]] and [[Steals items|items]] from your fortress, and if confronted, they may attack [[Dwarf|dwarves]] to defend themselves, but generally stand no chance against a [[hunter]] or even an unarmed peasant in a one-on one fight. Dwarves react violently to the presence of gray langurs, generally leading to your civilians going on wild chases after them whenever they pop up in your map, so they can punch the monkeys to death. All gray langurs are born with Legendary [[skill]] in [[Climber|climbing]].

Gray langurs may be captured in [[cage]] [[trap]]s and [[Animal trainer|trained]] into exotic [[pet]]s. They give a low quantity of returns when [[butcher]]ed, making them poor choices for livestock, but are fairly long-lived animals. Unlike most creatures, gray langurs reach adulthood at 3 years of age, though they're fully grown by the age of 2.

Some dwarves [[Preferences|like]] gray langurs for their ''social nature'' and their ''vocalizations''.

{{D for Dwarf}}
Although Dwarven ethics frowns upon the human habit of hunting for trophy animals, Dwarves have realized that there is nothing more merciful than dropping their current task to cave in the nearest langur's skull with their bare hands. Dwarves don't do this for fun, it's for the good of the fortress as a whole. Please don't miss the next lecture on Dwarven Ethics 101!
