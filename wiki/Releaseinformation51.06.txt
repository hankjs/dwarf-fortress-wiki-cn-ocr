'''Dwarf Fortress 51.06''' adds many bug fixes, nerfs prepared food value, and adjusts metal settings.

Two of the metal material values changed are {{token|TORSION_STRAIN_AT_YIELD|md}} and {{token|SHEAR_STRAIN_AT_YIELD|md}}. The increases in these two values for Bronze and Steel bring them within 10% of those previously-suggested by Putnam nearly 10 years ago in this forum post: [http://www.bay12forums.com/smf/index.php?topic=149938.msg6147647#msg6147647 Proper bronze, steel, bone and obsidian elasticity data].

Just posted another fixerly release. Probably do a few more of these before starting on siege stuff, and patches should continue during that process. Also have started what'll hopefully be a quick experimental test with [[Lua scripting|Lua]] over on a Steam branch before we merge that in everywhere.

I did a [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bViZEpBZnBY&feature=youtu.be lengthy interview] over on Blind's channel. They also provided a link to the [https://www.blindirl.com/sieges-adventures-magic-and-beyond/ raw audio].
