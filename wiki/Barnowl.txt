'''Barn owls''' are very common [[creature]]s found in a wide variety of [[biome]]s. They spawn individually and fly through the air, being otherwise unremarkable. They are benign and will not pose a threat to anything, and are among the smallest animals in the game who aren't [[vermin]]. All barn owls are born with Legendary [[skill]] in [[Climber|climbing]].

Barn owls can be captured in [[cage]] [[trap]]s and [[Animal trainer|trained]] into low-value [[pet]]s. Their females can be placed in a [[nest box]], where they'll lay a meager amount of [[egg]]s. Hunting them for food is worthless, as they're too small to give anything but a [[skull]] when [[butcher]]ed.

Some [[Dwarf|dwarves]] like barn owls for their ''coloration''.
