'''Python men''' are [[animal people]] versions of the common [[python]], who can be found in [[savage]] [[tropical]] moist broadleaf [[forest]]s. They spawn in groups of 1-3 individuals and are generally content to keep to themselves, but should nonetheless be approached with caution. In terms of size, they are a little over twice the weight of the average [[dwarf]].

Like other savage animal people, they can join [[civilization]]s, become [[historical figure]]s, appear as [[visitor]]s and be playable in [[adventurer mode]].

Some dwarves [[Preferences|like]] python men for their ''great size''.
