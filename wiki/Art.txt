==Fortress mode==
Art is a generic term for a way of recording [[Legends|history]]. You can order your dwarves to create art by ordering them to [[Smoothing|smooth]] and [[engraving|engrave]] stone walls, or to [[decoration|decorate]] objects. Art images can also appear on [[coin]]s and [[statue]]s. Art in the form of [[Book|written works]], which can be created by [[scholar]]s in your [[fortress]], will often reference historical events, or describe [[civilization]]s, smaller [[army|groups]], or [[historical figure]]s. Your [[citizenship|citizens]], as well as [[Visitor|visiting]] scholars, can even create written works on the [[Book#Art|subject of art]] itself.

Art records your fortress's history, such as when your dwarves were [[siege|besieged]] by [[Main:Boatmurdered|bloodthirsty]] [[elephant]]s.

Ordinarily, simply inspecting a piece of art only shows what the art is of. If you are in adventurer mode, or if the option is enabled in the [[init.txt]] file, inspecting a piece of art gives a history of what it depicts, including the names of those depicted.

==Adventure mode==
Art at previous fortresses or other sites can be seen and appreciated. For objects in the world, right-click it, choose to view it. You can also use {{K|l}} to look around, then {{K|Enter}} over an object you want to look at, then the letter for the view option. For items in your inventory, you can see their description by clicking the [[File:Mag glass icon.png]], or by pressing the letter of the item, then {{k|a}}.

==Legends mode==
Many works of art are created during [[world generation]], as well as a consequence of [[world activities]], often referencing [[Legends|historical]] events. They can even become [[Legendary artifact|artifacts]] and coveted [[Legendary_artifact#Non-player_artifacts|heirlooms]].
