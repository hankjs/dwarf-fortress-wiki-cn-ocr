The '''paper industry''' deals with the creation and processing of paper [[sheet]]s, and further processing into [[quire]]s and [[scroll]]s.

== Sheets ==
There are three major ways to create paper for books and scrolls - each depending on a different raw material.

The finished sheets can be stored in their own stockpile.

=== Raw materials ===
The raw materials that can be used:
*[[Papyrus_sedge|Papyrus]]
*Animal [[skin|hide]]
*Cloth plants
**[[rope reed]]
**[[pig tail]]
**[[hemp]]
**[[cotton]]
**[[ramie]]
**[[flax]]
**[[jute]]
**[[kenaf]]

=== Processing ===
The method, workshops, and labors required to process a material into sheets depends on the type of material.

==== Papyrus ====
[[Papyrus_sedge|Papyrus]] can be directly made into sheets at a [[farmer's workshop]], using the [[Papermaking]] labor.

==== Parchment ====
Processing [[Skin|animal hides]] is more complex; you need to produce [[quicklime]] from [[calcium carbonate]] stones at a [[kiln]], then process the [[quicklime]] to [[Milk_of_lime|milk of lime]] at an [[ashery]]. Finally, the hide and [[Milk_of_lime|milk of lime]] are used in a [[tanner's shop]], using the [[Tanner|tanning]] labor, to create a parchment sheet. For each sheet of parchment, 1 hide is needed, disregarding the size of the original animal.

If the hide is from a cow, it's called "vellum sheet", otherwise it will take on the name of the animal (i.e. pig parchment sheet, sheep parchment sheet).

==== Plant fibers ====
Cloth plants are mashed to [[slurry]] with a constructed [[millstone]] or [[quern]], then pressed to a sheet in a [[screw press]]. Both processes use the [[Papermaking]] labor.

== Finished goods ==
The sheets can then be further processed into finished goods.
=== Quires ===
1 sheet of paper can be crafted into 1 [[quire]] at a [[craftsdwarf's workshop]], using the [[Bookbinding]] labor.
=== Codices ===
After a [[quire]] has been filled with text, it can be crafted into a [[book|codex]] at a [[craftsdwarf's workshop]] using the [[Bookbinding]] labor - scrolls cannot be made into codices. This requires 1 [[quire]], 1 [[book binding]] and 1 unused [[thread]].  Animal [[hair]] thread can be used for this purpose.

=== Scrolls ===
1 sheet of paper can be combined with 1 [[Scroll_rollers|scroll roller]] at a [[craftsdwarf's workshop]] to create a [[scroll]] using the [[Bookbinding]] labor. Paper quality does not have any effect on scroll quality.
