'''Cave blobs''' are small rare [[creature]]s who inhabit the third layer of the [[cavern]]s. They lack [[bone]]s or any kind of internal organs, and instead are filled with orange fluid which causes mild, short-term [[Syndrome|harm]] in the form of painful blisters on other creatures when ingested or made contact with. Undead cave blobs will appear pink. The blob's skin is covered in this fluid as well; touching it is enough to potentially contract its syndrome. This fluid leaks if the creature’s skin is pierced, spilling out over the surrounding tiles. They are genderless, emotionless, have no need to breathe and are immune to [[No Stun|stunning]] or nausea, but due to their small size and fragile composition, an unarmed [[dwarf]] should be able to dispatch one without breaking a sweat. Cave blobs have no attacks other than a default [[push]], which will glance away from just about anything.

Cave blobs may be captured in [[cage]] [[trap]]s and [[Animal trainer|trained]] into low-value [[pet]]s. The only products gained by the [[butcher]]ing of a cave blob are a [[skin]] for your [[leatherworker]]s and a few pools of cave blob fluid, which can be drunk in [[adventurer mode]] to satiate thirst. Cave blobs are biologically immortal and only die from violence, so in case one of your dwarves is weird enough to adopt them, they'll potentially last forever.

Unlike most creatures, they can't be spawned in the [[object testing arena]].

Some dwarves [[Preferences|like]] cave blobs for their ''bright orange color''.

A way to improve adventurers who can start with cave blobs as tamed pets to become (mostly) safely and more easily highly potent in conventional combat has been found http://www.bay12forums.com/smf/index.php?topic=164906.msg8296757#msg8296757 (look for reply No.8).
