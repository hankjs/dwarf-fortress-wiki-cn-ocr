'''Nurse sharks''' are [[Cartilage|cartilaginous]] [[Creature#Aquatic|fish]] that can be found in [[temperate]] [[ocean]]s. At 2.5 times the size of an average [[dwarf]], they are fairly large fish and produce a decent amount of [[meat]] when [[butcher]]ed. As fully-sized creatures, they can't be fished by [[Fisherdwarf|fisherdwarves]], but can be caught with a [[drowning chamber]]. An infant nurse shark is called a ''nurse shark pup''.

Being cartilaginous, nurse sharks won't give [[bone]]s if butchered (though they'll still provide a [[skull]]).

Some dwarves [[Preferences|like]] nurse sharks for their ''tenacity''.
