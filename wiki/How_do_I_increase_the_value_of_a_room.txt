[[Zone#Quality_and_value|Room value]] can be essential, whether it is a high-class [[dining hall]] for your dwarves or opulent throne rooms for your [[noble]]s. Depending on what resources you have available, there are several ways to quickly [[Zone#Building optimally|increase the value]] of a room:

*Increase the size of the room - doubling the amount of floorspace nearly doubles the base value of the room (before furniture is added in).

*[[Smoothing]] and [[engraving]] the walls and floors. Note: when engraving walls, make sure your engravers are working from *inside* the room. Also note that smoothing enhances the value of walls more than that of floors, so you may want an oddly-shaped room with a lot of walls. Smoothing also increases the value of clusters/veins more than that of layer stone, even if the cluster stone has the same material value as the layer stone -- see [http://dffd.wimbli.com/file.php?id=7326 Kipi's research].

*Adding [[artifact]] furniture - a single legendary piece of furniture can greatly increase the value of a room.

*Adding high-value furniture - [[quality#masterwork|masterwork]] furniture is worth more than twice as much as the next highest level. [[Statue]]s have the highest [[item value|base value]] of "normal" furniture, while [[weapon trap]]s allow you to stack 11 high-value items into one convenient tile, and [[lever]]s allow stacking theoretically unlimited numbers of [[mechanism]]s.

*Adding more furniture - even low-quality furniture - can raise the room value, if you use enough of it. Fill the room with whatever leftovers are available and watch the value climb.

*Building [[floor bars]] only requires the [[furniture hauling]] skill, and can produce a modest increase in room value, particularly when expensive metal bars are used. Your metal bars can be reclaimed later if needed.

*Make sure the room is fully enclosed by walls and/or doors -- gaps in the perimeter reduce the value of certain features of the room by a percentage -- see [http://www.bay12forums.com/smf/index.php?topic=124938 here] for details.
