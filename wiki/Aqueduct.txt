An '''aqueduct''' is any set of elements that carries [[water]] or [[magma]] (the game's two types of fluids) from one location to another. Using a combination of [[channel]]s, [[dig|tunnels]], [[screw pump]]s, and natural or constructed [[floor]]s and [[wall]]s, an aqueduct taps into a natural source of either and creates a path for them to follow, using a combination of [[pressure]] and [[gravity]] to funnel it to its destination. Aqueducts are usually a means to an end and not an end in and of themselves.

Although simple aqueducts don't need much utility, certain measures like roofing over channels and installing [[lever]]-bound [[floodgate]]s or [[bridge]]s are useful for safety, maintenance, and modification reasons. More complicated aqueducts often handle [[pressure|pressurized]] flows; since in-game pressure sometimes behaves in counter intuitive ways, it is generally a good idea to familiarize oneself with its mechanics before undertaking any large project, lest [[flood]]ing occurs.

== Water ==
The most primitive kind of aqueduct is an open surface [[channel]], usually dug out from the local [[river]] or [[lake]] to your fortress to provide your dwarves with a less exposed [[fishing]] outlet and a source of [[thirst|clean drinking water]]. This is often combined with an equally simple [[reservoir]] and/or a [[well]]:

Only rivers and ''some'' [[murky pool]]s and [[lake]]s provide fresh surface water suitable for drinking and [[cleaning]] the [[wound]]s of injured dwarves. [[Ocean]]s always provide salt water, lakes may provide [[water#Stagnant_water|stagnant]] or salt water and murky pools are usually stagnant. Although these water sources can still be fished and used for various other purposes, they cannot be drunk from or used in injury treatment without a high [[infection]] risk, and must be desalinated through a [[screw pump]] first. [[Fortification]]s can be useful as they may prevent swimming creatures from pathing into your fortress through your waterworks, but only at depths less than 7/7, and creatures can be forced through fortifications (and vertical bars) by fluid [[flow]]. For better security, route your water supply upwards through a grate or set of horizontal bars--swimming creatures will be blocked, building destroyers will be stymied, and flow cannot push creatures vertically.

Another useful utility is a "dump" channel, an aqueduct that dumps a large body of fluid off-map. Shallow reservoirs are often quick-dumped off the edge of the map at the [[caverns]] level, to take advantage of [[gravity]] and minimize [[dig]]ging, while more permanent installations can reduce [[frames per second|FPS]] slowdown by routing water through fortifications carved at the map's edge.

== Magma ==
[[Magma]] is located in the bowels of the earth, and bringing it (closer) to the surface requires a special construction: the [[pump stack]] (aqueducts cannot "push" fluids up [[z-level]]s). Note that magma is much more viscous than water, so an over-application of pressure will be necessary to get a significant flow rate. Magma routing requires [[magma-safe]] materials.
