'''Termites''' are a species of [[above ground]] [[vermin]] who may be found in any non-freezing [[biome]]. They live in mounds ( [[File:Termite mound sprite.png|21px]] ) which can be spotted in the surface, and they can't be captured in [[animal trap]]s. Despite what their description indicates, they pose no danger to [[log]]s or wooden [[structure]]s.

Some dwarves [[Preferences|like]] termites for their ''industrious nature'' and their ''ability to devour wood''.

Research is underway on the easiest way to weaponize these wood-eating fiends as an assault force against elven forest retreats.
