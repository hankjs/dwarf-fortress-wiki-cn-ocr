'''Warthog men''' are [[animal people]] versions of the common [[warthog]], who can be found in [[savage]] [[tropical]] flatlands. They spawn in groups of 5-10 individuals and are generally content to keep to themselves, but may pick fights with civilians if approached. In terms of size, they are a little larger than the average [[human]].

Like other savage animal people, they can join [[civilization]]s, become [[historical figure]]s, appear as [[visitor]]s and be playable in [[adventurer mode]].

Some dwarves [[Preferences|like]] warthog men for their ''short tempers''.
