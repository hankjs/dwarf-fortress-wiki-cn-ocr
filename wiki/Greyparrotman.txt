'''Grey parrot men''' are [[animal people]] variants of the common [[grey parrot]], who inhabit [[savage]] [[tropical]] moist broadleaf [[forest]]s. They spawn in groups of 3-5 individuals and are generally content to keep to themselves. In terms of size, they are a little over half the weight of the average [[dwarf]]. All grey parrot men are born with Legendary [[skill]] in [[Climber|climbing]].

Like other savage animal people, grey parrot men can join [[civilization]]s, become [[historical figure]]s, appear as [[visitor]]s and be playable in [[adventurer mode]].

Some dwarves [[Preferences|like]] grey parrot men for their ''social nature'' and their ''intelligence''.
