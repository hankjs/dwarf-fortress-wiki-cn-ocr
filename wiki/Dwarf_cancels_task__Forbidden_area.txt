{{DFtext|Dwarf cancels task: Forbidden area.}}

This message occurs when a civilian [[burrow]] specified in a [[civilian alert]] excludes the destination of a dwarf on a task. This can commonly result from expanding your fortress after designating a civilian burrow, but failing to extend the burrow to encompass the new areas. Unfortunately, this message zooms to the location of the dwarf when the task was canceled, making it quite difficult to track down the location of the task/item that is causing the error.
