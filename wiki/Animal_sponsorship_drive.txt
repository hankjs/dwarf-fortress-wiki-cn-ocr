'''Rainseeker's Animal Sponsorship Drive''' was a donation event held by [[Bay 12 Games]] which took place in December 2010, suggested by and named after Rainseeker, one of the co-hosts of [[Dwarf Fortress Talk]]. During the course of the month, donations made to Bay 12 Games allowed donors to pick a new [[Creature|animal]] to be added to the game. The event ended with the developers gaining a total of $9.416,16 over the course of December, the second most successful month of the year (losing only to April, which saw the release of [[v0.31:Release information|version 0.31.01]]).

While the event is long over, the website holding the results is still [http://www.bay12games.com/dwarves/sponsor.html available], though it is not linked anywhere in the current Bay 12 Games page.

All the animals added through the Sponsorship Drive have a special note in their [[raw file]]s stating "[animal name] were sponsored by the generous contributions of the Bay 12 community".

==Animals Not Added==
The list of all eligible animals is gone to time*. However, some animals were mentioned as options in [http://www.bay12forums.com/smf/index.php?topic=73252.0 the associated forum thread], yet did not make it in. Below is a list of those animals.

* Anteater
* Blue whale
* Boa constrictor
* Cicada
* Ferret
* Flea
* Fruit bat
* Lory (unclear, since lorikeet was "also" on the list)
* King crab
* Proboscis monkey
* River dolphin
* Spitting cobra
* Zebra

<nowiki>*</nowiki>At some point in time, the Bay 12 website blocked the Wayback Machine for being bandwidth intensive (source:[https://www.bay12games.com/robots.txt robots.txt]). Though this block does no longer work, the Wayback Machine has no archived version of the page before May 2011 (and thus no complete list), and this is likely why.

==Release History==

The sponsored animals were released in four waves from 2011 to 2012. The first wave (0.31.19) contained honey bees, bumblebees, and beekeeping. The second wave (0.31.20) contained Panda, Capybara, and their variants. The third wave (0.31.22) contained Penguins, Platypuses, Badgers, Moose, and all their variants. The fourth and largest wave (0.34.01) added 360 new sponsored creatures. This brings the total number of sponsored creatures to 382. With a total of 767 non-procedural creatures in the game, sponsored creatures make up over 49.8% of them.

===Release Notes===

====Version 0.31.19====
Bees were the winner of the animal sponsorship drive and they had many associated jobs, so we didn't try to get into the other sponsored beasts, but we'll be adding those in with every release.

====Version 0.31.20====
This is the first bug fix release for 0.31.19, where I've focused on new bugs. … It also includes a few sponsored critters (pandas and capybaras), as well as some of their wilder relatives.  Pandas are restricted to bamboo grazing and capybaras can vocalize in adv mode (bark, whistle, etc).

New stuff
	(*) Sponsored animals included: panda and capybara, along with related buddies

====Version 0.31.22====
New stuff
	(*) Sponsored animals included: penguin, platypus, badger, moose, along with related buddies

====Version 0.34.01====
New stuff
…
	(*) all sponsorship animals and their giant/man versions are in the game now
