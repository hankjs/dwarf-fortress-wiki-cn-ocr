[[File:maul_sprite_preview.png|right]]
A '''maul''' is a [[blunt]] [[weapon]] that is essentially a very large [[war hammer]] (similar to a modern-day sledgehammer). Mauls are more than three times larger than standard war hammers, with a similar "bash" attack. Mauls also have a 10× larger contact area and greatly increased penetration, but cannot be swung with nearly as much velocity. Their great size grants them a large amount of momentum however, and they easily bend and mangle joints when striking limbs and other extremities.

Mauls use and train the [[hammerdwarf]] skill. Being foreign weapons, dwarves cannot [[forge]] mauls, limiting supply to whatever specimens can be traded from human [[caravan]]s (which can never be [[steel]] ones, but can be of masterwork [[quality]] if you're lucky) or scavenged from invaders; although, it is possible that a dwarf in a [[strange mood]] craft a maul as a [[legendary artifact]].

[[Weapon#Size|Due to the size of mauls]], most dwarves are unable to equip them. With height and broadness modifiers, some dwarves ''should'' be able to use a maul, and a select few might manage to do so one-handed. Unfortunately, due to a [[#Bugs|bug]], mauls cannot currently be equipped by any dwarves, but they work really well inside a [[weapon trap]]. Alternatively, you can grant residency to human [[visitors]] and have them wield them for you.

==Bugs==
In fortress mode, one-handed vs. two-handed checks are performed correctly, but can wield vs. can't wield ignores height and broadness modifiers, so dwarves cannot equip mauls.{{Bug|0005812}} See [http://www.bay12forums.com/smf/index.php?topic=119068.msg3790913#msg3790913 this forum post] for details.
