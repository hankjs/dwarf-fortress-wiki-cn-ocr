'''Hamster men''' are [[animal people]] variants of the common [[hamster]] who can be found in almost all [[savage]] regions. They spawn in groups of 1-5 individuals and are generally content to keep to themselves. In terms of size, they are a little over half the weight of the average [[dwarf]].

Like other savage animal people, they can join [[civilization]]s, become [[historical figure]]s, appear as [[visitor]]s and be playable in [[adventurer mode]].

Some dwarves [[Preferences|like]] hamster men for their ''puffy cheeks''.

Many prophets have stated that [[human]]s will invent something in the future where a rendering of many dancing hamsters can be seen at once, complete with high-pitched musical vocals.
