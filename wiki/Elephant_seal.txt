'''Elephant seals''' are [[amphibious]] [[Creature|mammals]] significantly larger than common [[Domestic animal|domestic livestock]] (2-5 times the size of a standard [[cow]]). They inhabit [[arctic ocean]]s in groups of 5-10, living both on the surface of the [[ice]] and in the [[water]] underneath it.

Elephant seals can be [[animal trainer|trained]] and kept as [[pet]]s, but their real value lies in their [[butcher]]ing returns. By breeding elephant seals, your [[meat industry]] can sustain your entire fortress with food to spare. Note, however, that it takes five years for elephant seal pups to reach full adult size.

Unlike most animals, there is a significant size difference between the sexes of elephant seals. Males grow to more than three times the size of females, resulting in large variances in butchering returns. Only the males will drop a tooth when butchered.

Some dwarves [[preference|like]] elephant seals for their ''large floppy noses'' and their ''great size''.
