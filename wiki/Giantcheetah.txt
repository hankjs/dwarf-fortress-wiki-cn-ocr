'''Giant cheetahs''' are [[Giant animal|massive]], strong and carnivorous animals, roaming savage [[tropical]] areas. They are roughly 11 times the size of their [[Cheetah|normal-sized cousins]]. Baby giant cheetahs are slightly smaller than a standard [[cow]]. Giant cheetahs may also appear as [[mount]]s during a [[siege]].

Captured giant cheetahs may be [[tame]]d and kept as [[pet]]s, [[animal trainer|trained]] for hunting or war, or used as livestock for a [[meat industry]]. While they do not produce as much meat as other "giant" creatures, giant cheetah [[butcher|butchering]] returns are worth four times as much as common domestic animals.

Despite their much greater size, giant cheetahs cannot sprint any [[gait|faster]] than normal ones.

Some dwarves [[Preferences|like]] giant cheetahs for their ''speed''.

<!-- "Night Trolls are Giant Cheaters!!" -->
There have been reports of some in the adventurer community vehemently calling [[night troll]]s "giant cheetahs" because of how often one that receives a spine-destroying blow from a supposedly prepared and surely winning opponent somehow manages to turn the tide and, soon after, mercilessly beats said adventurer to a pulp or shreds them into ribbons with incredible alacrity, with the fatal injury often ironically being sometimes direct but frequently indirect damage to the spine. Our fortress dwarves have yet to figure out how the label of "giant cheetah" would, at all, make sense in this context.
