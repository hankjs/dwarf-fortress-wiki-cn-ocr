'''Abaca''' is one of the many genera of trees found aboveground in any tropical jungle. 
Unlike most trees, it produces no wood; the raws suggest that it will one day produce textile fibers, but that function is not yet implemented. Unlike most trees, it does not branch out, instead standing vertically. Despite the tree having leaves in real life, they do not show graphically in-game.

Some [[Dwarf|dwarves]] [[Preferences|like]] abaca trees for their ''leaves''.
