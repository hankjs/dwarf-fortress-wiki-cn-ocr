'''Coffee''' is one of the many genera of [[tree]]s found above ground. Like the vast majority of above ground trees, coffee [[wood]] is brown and produces brown products.

Coffee trees bear coffee cherry [[fruit]]. These fruits can be eaten or cooked and produce coffee beans when eaten. Coffee beans cannot be eaten or brewed into coffee, nor can their cherries be brewed into [[booze]]. <s>So feel free to cut each and every one of these useless elf houses.</s> But they can be processed in a [[dyer's shop]] into brown [[dye]].

Some [[Dwarf|dwarves]] [[Preferences|like]] coffee for their ''yummy cherries''.
