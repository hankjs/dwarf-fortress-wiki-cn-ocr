[[File:Duplicated raws error message.png|right]]

'''Duplication of [[raw file]] entries''' is a type of game [[bug]], widely known in the community, due to the bizarre effects this particular bug has on [[world generation]], and is usually caused by a [[modding]] accident, though in the past some players manufactured duplicated raws on purpose to create crazy glitched worlds.

The exact effects of the bug happen at the end of worldgen, and vary depending on type and amount of duplicated raw entries.

As of 52.01, attempting to generate a world with duplicated raws prompts an error message and returns the user to the setup screen. Any offending mods must be removed from the load order before continuing.

== Overview ==

The term refers to the duplication of game object definitions present in the game's [[raw file]]s. The presence of raw entries (such as <code>[CREATURE:DWARF]</code>) being defined more than once causes internal numeric IDs of the target type to be misattributed during the initial save, resulting in each pointer after the point of duplication being shifted one entry forward. Definitions before the point of duplication are unaffected. The effects are cumulative when more than one duplicated entry is present.

If the game finds any duplicated raws when loading a save, it writes an appropriate message in [[errorlog.txt]] per each duplicated entry.

== Duplicated creatures ==

Duplication of [[creature]] raws results in wrong creatures appearing in the wrong places and assuming the wrong roles during gameplay, with many messy and/or hilarious results. It has been known to cause [[cave crocodile]]s to live in houses, civilizations of [[elephant]]s to form, [[camel]]s to wear clothes, [[fluffy wambler]]s to pull wagons, and so on. It also causes creature materials to glitch, which likely results in civilians wearing [[clothing]] made out of liver tissue, chicken teeth, [[soap]], or "[[unknown frozen creature substance]]", to name a few, and other weirdnesses, such as [[llama]] [[egg]]s being available on embark.

This type of raw file duplication is very prone to spontaneous crashing, and duplicating all creatures will almost certainly result in a crash during worldgen, so it's not advised to do this during regular play.

== Duplicated plants ==

One of the most visible results of duplicated [[plant]] raws is a complete lack of [[tree]]s. Other vegetation will likely be replaced by uniform dark green [[grass]] composed of non-grass plants, or generic grass like that from before the [[v0.31:Release information/0.31.19|v0.31.19]] release.

Plant materials, notably [[wood]], will be screwed up the same way creature materials are in creature raws duplication - that is, your would-be wooden items will be composed instead of [[plump helmet]]s, frozen [[booze]], [[dye]], or "[[unknown frozen plant substance]]". Other plant-derived items will be affected as well.

== Duplicated materials ==

Duplication of inorganic material raws results in wrong materials forming [[stone layers|geological layers]] and inclusions, some of which normally don't appear within the world's crust. These can produce unusual resources when mined, such as metal boulders. Below is the list of what materials you can encounter, and how you can put them to use.

<small>n.b. Although duplication of "default" (rather than 'inorganic') materials have been a feature of a few mods for quite some time, and there have been no verified bugs directly related to this, the developers of the game have assured the community that these definitely will be causing errors, even if they are not immediately apparent to players.</small>

=== Displaced [[stone|minerals]], [[soil]]s, and [[metal]] layers === 

The amount of displaced minerals will depend on the place in which raw file duplication has occurred - sometimes, you can even find entire layers composed of usable [[ore]].

[[Soil]], [[sand]], and [[clay]] tiles can also be displaced, which will likely result in [[aquifer]]s being generated in unexpected places, such as in [[vein|mineral deposits]]. The tiles themselves will be unusable in sand/clay production, however, unless they happen to form the entire layer.

Contrary to what you might think, metal layers produce metal ''boulders'' when mined, which can either be [[melt]]ed into a meager amount of metal [[bars]], or directly made into [[short sword]]s, the same way [[obsidian]] swords are made.

=== [[Evil weather]] materials ===

Evil weather materials have no melting or boiling point, and, thus, will always be mined as solids. These can be used either as basic [[construction]] material, or in [[jewelry]], but not [[masonry|stoneworking]]. Note that mining them and working with created 'boulders' is perfectly safe, but [[cave-in]] dust '''will''' transfer any syndromes of the material, likely turning the majority of your population into undead [[husk]]s.

=== [[Divine fabric]] ===

While not fire-safe, divine fabric has an astonishingly-high base [[value]] of 300, making it perfect for [[decoration]]. Unfortunately, 'boulders' composed of it cannot be processed into thread, being workable only at a [[jeweler's workshop]].

=== [[Divine metal]] ===

This metal of the [[deity|gods]] is completely impervious to [[temperature|heat]], and superior to anything other than [[adamantine]]. Mined boulders of it can be processed the same way as boulders of other metals, discussed above.

=== Undefined materials ===
If a given region's list of geological layers ends up not containing any Stone or Soil materials, the corresponding terrain tiles will rapidly flicker between '''all''' possible inorganic materials. Attempting to designate such Wall tiles will randomly fail whenever the game picks an undiggable material such as [[slade]] (and successfully-designated tiles may randomly fail to mine with "Inappropriate dig square" for the same reason), and successfully mining one will produce a completely random result, with gem materials yielding rough gems and everything else yielding boulders.
