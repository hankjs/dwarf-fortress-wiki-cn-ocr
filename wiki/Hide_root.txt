'''Hide root''' is an [[above ground]] [[crop]]. It can be acquired by [[plant gathering|harvesting]] or by [[trading]]. It is [[milling|milled]] into redroot [[dye]] in order to dye [[cloth]] and [[thread]].

Actual redroot dye is brown in color; presumably, this is a bug, since there ''are'' rolls of red cloth in the [[clothier's shop]] sprite, and Redroot Dye is the only dye to where its powder state color, Brown, is different from the name of its dye: Red. Unfortunately, this means that when applied, it will make any cloth or silk look identical to undyed leather, and tends to make it difficult to tell what is and isn't dyed at a glance. Depending on how you feel about that, you may want to avoid using redroot dye at all without [https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2936712087 a mod that changes this].

Some [[dwarves]] [[Preferences|like]] hide root for their ''fuzzy projections''.

{{D for Dwarf}}
Since redroot dye's value is ''half'' that of all other dyes, it is rumored that 'hide' is short for 'hideous'.
