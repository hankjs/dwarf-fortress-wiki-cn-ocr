'''Giant wolverines''' are a force to be reckoned with. While they are solitary, a single giant wolverine is more than a match for a single dwarf or any livestock. If left unchecked, they will move randomly around the map until they find a target. When they do, they will become enraged, beeline for the target, and likely immediately try to kill it upon catching up to it.

Luckily, a giant wolverine can't use attacks much more powerful than simple bites and scratches, so a military equipped with decent [[metal]] armor should be able to deal with them easily, as natural weapons are not the most deadly against [[dwarf]]-made [[armor]].

Some dwarves [[Preferences|like]] giant wolverines for their ''tenacity''.
