'''Rutile''' is a [[color|flax]]-colored [[stone]] (in [[Premium]], or purple-colored in [[classic]]) found in small clusters within [[metamorphic layer|metamorphic]] [[stone]]s, as well as within [[granite]]. Like [[pitchblende]], it is [[magma-safe]].

==In real life==
Rutile is one of three mineral forms of titanium dioxide (the others being anatase and brookite).  Rutile has one of the highest refraction indices of all natural material. It is used for the manufacture of refractory ceramic, a white pigment, or production of titanium metal.
