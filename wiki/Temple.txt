[[File:temple_preview.png|right]]A '''temple''' is a structure devoted to an object of worship, which, typically, is any [[sphere]]-aligned being, such as a [[deity]], [[megabeast]], or [[titan]]. 

==Fortress mode==
[[File:df_temple_preview.png|thumb|right|Dwarves and visitors praying in a high-level temple.]]In [[fortress mode]], temples are [[location]]s ({{Menu icon|P}}) that can be created from any [[zone]]s. Temples can be dedicated either to any deity worshipped by at least one of your [[dwarves]] (not necessarily from the world's dwarven pantheon), or to "no particular deity", making it a place for anyone to meditate or to worship whomever they want. Dwarves who worship foreign gods--which is to say, gods who originate in civilizations outside of your own--need specific temples while worshipers of local gods will be satisfied by a temple dedicated to no particular deity.

==== Requirements ====

A temple can be dedicated from any [[meeting area]]. Temples require [[instrument]]s for their music, and thus require [[chest]]s to store them. However, a temple created with no instruments will still be used by citizens and visitors. Temples also require an empty floor space (called ''dance floor'') with a minimum surface of 25 tiles{{verify}}, the same as [[tavern]]s. [[Performer]]s can also be assigned to temples to perform sacred dances. Beyond being religious activity, dances and poetry in temples fulfill the same functions as they do in taverns, with the caveat of being limited to followers of said faith.

==== Effect on Mood, Thoughts ====

Communing with their deity or meditating decreases [[stress]] significantly with ''enraptured'' [[emotions]]. Not having a designated place to pray, on the other hand, makes dwarves sad or [[Need|distracted]]. Thus, making a temple early on might be a good investment for your fortress, even more so if you're going through difficult times. Simply designating any zone as a place to pray is enough to initially satisfy most of your dwarves; you do not need to provide instruments or containers for your dwarves to pray.

==== Specific Temples ==== 

You may dedicate a temple to a specific deity or religion. This leads to a greater mood boost for those who worship that deity, and it is '''required''' for prayer to any deities originating from outside your civilization. 

When one of your fortress's religious organisations (sects) has sufficient members (10 by default), they may [[petition]] for the creation of a temple specific to their faith. Be advised that now you'll be dedicating it to the religious organisation as opposed to their deity (only then you can appoint its priests). The petition is satisfied once it has a minimum value of 2000 and when [[priest]]hood is recognised. Once established, these worshipers may congregate at the new temple, though it does not stop them from using other temples to no particular deity; satisfying the petition is sufficient to please them. If the petition is ignored for too long, it is eventually abandoned, and the petitioners will receive unhappy thoughts. A temple with a value lower than 2000 is called a '''shrine''', but with a value of 10000 or higher, it becomes a '''temple complex''', which is needed to recognise [[priest|high priesthood]]. The petition trigger and satisfaction numbers can be modified in the [[Difficulty#Temple|difficulty]] [[settings]].

If you find yourself struggling to get your shrine up to temple status, or to go from temple to temple complex, there are two tried-and-true methods for increasing wealth:

* [[Pedestal]]s
: Made at either a carpenter, metalsmith or stone worker's shop, a pedestal is capable of holding objects for display. Once filled, it can increase a room's value significantly. Gems, artifacts, or other high-value items are a great choice here.

* [[Engraving|Engraved]] metal [[floor]]ing
: Being more valuable than basic rock flooring, metal floors can offer ''incredible'' wealth gains for your dwarves' place of worship. With fine metal flooring (ex. gold, steel) and a skilled engraver, you can create a lot of wealth relatively quickly. 

'''REMINDER:''' If a group of dwarves file a petition for a deity-specific temple, it's a good idea to write down the petitioners' request for the specific deity and/or religious sect, as it's often not accessible from the UI after you accept the petition. Although, if you have [[DFHack]], you can use the command <code>list-agreements</code> to find it. Once a location is designated you can verify the current value & level as well as the agreed on level via the [[location]]s ({{Menu icon|P}}) menu and selecting to the location.

You might also try scrolling through the [[need]]s of your dwarves until you see a repeated “Pray to” need unmet, and create a temple for that god.

==== Final Notes on Fortress-Mode Temples ==== 

[[Pilgrim]]s will visit fortresses specifically to hang out in temples. Other [[visitor]]s may pass by the temple and socialize with the dwarves there, if they came to visit a tavern or [[library]].

As in Adventure mode, worshipers of the temple's deity that topple a [[statue]] (or anything else that's been {{Menu icon|b}} built) in a temple will be cursed as a [[vampire]] or [[werebeast]] {{cite forum|160118/7144627}}{{cite reddit|8l8x7i}}.

==Adventure mode==
World-generated temples are visitable in [[adventurer mode]]. They are located in [[human]] towns and [[goblin]] fortresses, with smaller temples in [[monastery|monasteries]] and [[fort]]s, and are built when a given [[religion]] has enough followers in said site, or the site is dedicated to the religion. [[Priest]]s can be found in temples, and will allow you to join the local sect of their religion with the conversation topic 'Service'. In the current version, it is not possible to join a temple.

On first joining a sect dedicated to a particular object of worship, that entity will be added to the character's record. An adventurer can then [[Talking|converse]] ({{Adv menu icon|k}}) anywhere with any deific object of worship. Though the deity's only response is silence, repeated conversations can change the deity's 'object of worship' [[Relationship|status]] from 'dubious' to 'casual', 'object', 'devoted' and 'ardent'. It's unknown whether conversing with other objects of worship can increase their worship status; megabeasts tend to be [[Faction|uniformly hostile]], though titans may be flagged 'benign'{{verify}}.

Temples can have basements, sometimes extensive [[catacombs]], which may be crawling with enemies. These range from the typical [[kobold]]s and [[goblin]]s, to the occasional lurking [[mummy]] (with assorted [[Undead|skeletal]] minions). [[Pedestal]]s will be found in these lower levels, and will sometimes contain holy [[artifact]]s.

You can defile a temple of your deity by toppling a [[statue]], which leads to being cursed by the patron deity with either [[vampire|vampirism]] or becoming a [[werebeast]]. For this, the temple must be actively used (i.e. not an old ruin).

=== Architecture ===
Each temple found in procedurally-generated towns will have its own architecture, where certain architectural elements are chosen depending on the spheres to which the temple belongs. A temple can use a certain architectural element because of its likeness to their worshipped spheres, but also because of an antithetical relationship to said spheres. A complete list of architectural elements, as well as their connection to different spheres, is given in the table below. Since the introduction of institutionalized [[religion]]s, this seems to have changed somewhat, with most such temples having a wide array of architectural elements.

=== Shrines ===
Before a temple is built in a site, there will be shrines dedicated to a given religion, consisting of a small garden, a [[statue]], and either a [[pedestal]] or an [[altar]]. If the religion has a divination tradition, divination [[dice]] can be found in these shrines. '''(Not to be confused with the lairs of [[titan]]s, also called [[Shrine (megabeast)|shrine]]s.)'''

=== Razing ===
Occasionally during worldgen, a site government may choose to raze an old temple, and build a new one in its stead. The ruins of the old temple, as well as any catacombs it was connected to, will still be explorable in adventure mode.  Interestingly, the construction of the new temple will always coincide with the formation of a new religious order to utilize it - the order belonging to the old temple will remain on the site, but will move their offices to the keep. Due to this, leaders of "archaic" orders are often found in the keep.

== Language ==
The dwarven word for temple (religious building)  is ''rath.'' This page refers to the word "temple" in this sense, that of a divine location. Not to be confused with the identical English [[wikipedia:homonym|homonym]] meaning head, which is ''mor'' in Dwarven (temple as head, crown, or forehead).
