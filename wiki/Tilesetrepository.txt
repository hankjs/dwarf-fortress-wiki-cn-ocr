A character set, or simply [[tilesets|tileset]], is an image in BMP or PNG format that contains the 256 different tiles, corresponding to the [[Main:Character table|IBM Code Page 437]] (sometimes called Extended ASCII). They are used to display the text elements in graphics mode and everything in ASCII mode. This page serves as a repository for custom tilesets made by users, including instructions on how to install them.

==Background==

The default tilesets (640×300 and 800×600) render 8×12 and 10×12 characters respectively, with majuscule latin letters occupying a 7×9 box, and appear broadly similar to the IBM MDA font based on the shape of the "0", "g", and "f" characters (but with slight differences including the "0", "W", and "y"). The exact origin of the DF font is unknown.

==Installation==
<!-- last tested 53.10 -->
{{TipBox|#fb0|float=center|'''Currently, using some tilesets can cause the lower and right edges of the screen to not react to the mouse.'''{{bug|13462}} This is dependent on size; the 8×12 and 10×12 that come with the game are fine, but the 16×16 is not. Maximizing the window or [[Settings|setting]] the game to fullscreen may avoid this.}}
Other issues that can appear when using a different tileset:
* In graphics mode, the minimap frame will scale to the tileset, but the minimap image will not.
* In graphics mode, using a tileset with a different aspect ratio will stretch UI elements.
* In graphics mode, some UI elements do not scale to the tileset.
* In either mode, and even with the default tileset at some scales and game display sizes, some menus may not have enough space to display all elements; the [[Noble#Menu|Nobles menu]] especially.

To use a specific tileset with ''Dwarf Fortress'', you must perform the following steps:

# Download the tileset to your computer. Each tileset is just an image, so there is no separate download link. ('''Right-Click''' on the tileset image and '''Save-As'''.) Alternatively, export a BMP from [https://github.com/viler-int10h/Fontraption Fontraption].
# If necessary, convert the tileset to the correct image format for the version of DF you are using:
## Under '''ANY''' circumstances, you '''MUST NOT''' just change the extension to .bmp or .png or the tileset will be unusable. You '''MUST''' use a program like MS Paint to save it properly.
## For ''[[40d:Release information/0.28.181.40d|DF 0.28.181.40d]] or older:'' open the file in an image editor and save it as a '''24-bit bitmap''' (BMP) if it isn't already in that format.
## For ''[[v0.31:Release information/0.31.01|DF 0.31.01]] or newer:'' open the file in an image editor and save it as a '''PNG'''  with ''transparency'' if it isn't already in that format.
# Move or copy the file to the DF art directory ({{tt|data/art}}), which is in the game installation folder.
## Alternatively, depending on the the [[Settings#Portable_mode|portable mode setting]], files in the ''Local User''{{tt|/data/art}} folder will override the files in the installation folder.
# Edit the {{tt|data/init/init_default.txt}} file to specify the tileset file to use. There are three lines that can be changed:
## '''[FONT:''<filename>'']''' — the tileset for a windowed display.
## '''[FULLFONT:''<filename>'']''' — the tileset for a full-screen display.
## '''[BASIC_FONT:''<filename>'']''' — the tileset for initial loading and menu display.
## All three can be set to the same file. In fact, setting them to different files can give unexpected results.
## Once you have made the changes you need to remember to save the file.
# If the selected tileset requires modifications to the [[Raw]]s, you will have to make those edits.  What those changes are will depend on the tileset itself, and may only be valid for older versions. Likewise, some tilesets may suggest changes to {{tt|d_init.txt}}, such as {{tt|[PILLAR_TILE:255]}}, but those options, sadly, no longer exist.

Once the file is saved and the required changes are made, you are ready to play DF with your new tileset! The game does not save these FONT options in {{tt|prefs/init.txt}}, so adding them there will only be temporary.

Then I spotted Alexander's Jolly Bastion and took some ideas from him ( big thanks to Alexander too! ) like sky tiles and color. Then I applied Lee's Natural Color Scheme with modified "BLACK" value and here it is! Grim Fortress. It is pretty dark, kinda foggy and I think the name "Grim Fortress" fits well.

I've left alone everything which was related to mining or was meant to be plain, for example the smoothered tiles and the plain tiles in the demo. The reason behind that is that I didn't find much logic to have those graphics shaded as they could possibly connect on any direction on the screen, which would make the shading a little strange. Please note that this tileset is only a "beta". I might work on it again if there is enough people who like it and would like improvements.
