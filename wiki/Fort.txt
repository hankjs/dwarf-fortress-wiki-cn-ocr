:''Not to be confused with [[Fortress]].''

A '''fort'''  ([[File:icon_site_fort.png]], [[File:icon_site_fort2.png]] / {{Raw Tile|○|0:6:0}}) is a [[site]] inhabited by [[Mercenary|mercenaries]] or [[bandit]]s.

Forts are sites surrounded by tall walls. They will often have dining halls and dormitories. If a Mercenary Company dedicated to a [[religion]] is in charge of the fort, there may also be a [[temple]] dedicated to their deity. As only mercenary companies can have such a temple, and bandits are rather violent, it can help to look for a white structure on the mid-level travel map, which marks the location of the temple.
