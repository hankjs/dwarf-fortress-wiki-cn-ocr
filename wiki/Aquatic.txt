'''Aquatic''' [[creature]]s have the <tt>[AQUATIC]</tt> [[creature token]], and so are restricted to life underwater. An aquatic creature that is located in water less than 4/7 [[water depth|deep]] or removed from water entirely will air-drown; aquatic animals caught in such situations even briefly will be momentarily [[status icon|winded]]. Usually such situations are the result of dwarven interaction, except in the case of [[beaching|beached]] [[whale]]s. Note that aquatic creatures in [[cage]]s (or [[aquarium]]s for flavor) do not currently drown, unless they were drowning when they were placed or caught in the cage.
