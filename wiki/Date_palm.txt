'''Date palms''' are one of the many genera of [[tree]]s found [[Tile attributes|above ground]]. Like the vast majority of above ground trees, date palm [[wood]] is brown and produces brown products.

Date palms bear '''dates''' that can be harvested by setting up a gathering [[zone]]. They can be eaten raw, cooked, or brewed into [[alcohol|date wine]]. The flower stalks can also be harvested in the spring, but can only be eaten or cooked. Due to their narrow profile and the height that they grow to, date palms may not be worth harvesting unless nothing else is available.

Some [[Dwarf|dwarves]] [[Preferences|like]] date palms for their ''fruit''.
