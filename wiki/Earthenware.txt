'''Earthenware''' is a type of [[ceramic]] made from ordinary [[clay]] (as well as [[silty clay]], [[sandy clay]], or [[clay loam]]). Much like [[green glass]] (and [[clear glass]], to a lesser extent), earthenware items can be produced in unlimited quantities, as long as you have a source of clay in your fortress. They are brown in color and have a material value of 3, equal to that of [[obsidian]].

Other than its potential abundance, earthenware is also very light, making it perfect for crafting containers. However, earthenware containers must be [[glaze]]d in order to store liquids.
