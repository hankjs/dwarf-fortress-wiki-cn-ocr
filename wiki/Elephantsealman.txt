'''Elephant seal men''' are [[animal people]] variants of the common [[elephant seal]] who can be found in [[savage]] [[arctic]] [[ocean]]s, spawning in groups of 5-10 individuals, and can easily dispose of [[dwarves]] who provoke them thanks to their enormous size. Much like their animal versions, elephant seal men possess notable sexual dimorphism; males are about as large as a [[walrus]], while females are only about as large as a [[horse]] (being nonetheless much larger than dwarves).

Like other savage animal people, they can join [[civilization]]s, become [[historical figure]]s, appear as [[visitor]]s and be playable in [[adventurer mode]]. Due to their size, elephant seal men (especially males) can make strong adventurers. However, their large size also leaves them unable to equip generated armor, a problem many animal people have in common. Their amphibious nature is an interesting bonus, allowing for exploration of the usually-foreboding ocean. 

Some dwarves [[preference|like]] elephant seal men for their ''large floppy noses'' and their ''great size''.

It is unknown if the cuteness of [[elephant seal]] pups is retained in their humanoid cousins.
