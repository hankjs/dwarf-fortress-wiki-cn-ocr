'''Animal dissector''' is a [[skill]] associated with the animal dissection [[labor]]. Animal dissectors make [[extracts]] from certain caged [[vermin]], either [[fire snake]]s, [[cave spider]]s, or [[phantom spider]]s, at a [[butcher's shop]], stored in a suitable [[vial]]. The [[skill|skill level]] of the dissector determines the speed at which the labor is completed, and the [[quality]] and material of the vial used adds to the value of the final product. The vermin themselves must be caught in [[animal trap]]s by [[trapper]]s, and do not survive the extraction process.

Animal dissection (along with the similar [[fish dissection]] skill) is only marginally more useful than [[cheese maker|cheesemaking]] in the current version of ''Dwarf Fortress''. There are only a few vermin applicable to the skill out of many such species that trappers may catch. Since currently there is no way to specifically target trapping jobs, this makes them difficult to collect in any practical volume.

Dissecting a [[fire snake]] produces [[liquid fire]], a [[trade good]] which is produced in stacks of five and worth a not-insignificant 500☼ in total.  Other vermin produce [[venom]], which unfortunately cannot be applied to [[weapon]]s and thus also serves as a (less valuable) trade good.

Once [[alchemy]] is implemented (and trappers are made to target specific species, and poisons are made to be reliable in [[weapon]] application), animal dissection will likely become a more useful skill for your dwarves to have.
