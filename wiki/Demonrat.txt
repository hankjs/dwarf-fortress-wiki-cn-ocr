'''Demon rats''' are a species of [[above ground]] [[vermin]], found in any [[evil]] areas that are not [[biome|freezing]]. They can steal and eat [[food]] in [[stockpiles]], even biting through [[barrel|containers]] to do so. They can be captured by [[trapper]]s and turned into low-value [[pet]]s. Despite their names, they have no relation to [[Hidden Fun Stuff|you-know-what]]. 

A curious oddity concerning demon rats is their blood is a gray-colored goo.

Some [[dwarves]] [[Preferences|like]] demon rats for their ''insidious nature'' and their ''diabolical hunger for the food of others''.
