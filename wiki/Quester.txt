'''Questers''' are foreign representatives of [[civilization]]s, families and other such entities, that have been sent off to various missions. They are essentially non-player [[Adventure mode|adventurers]] acting on behalf of their parent entity, slaying some beast or retrieving [[artifact]]s the entity has laid a [[claim]] to.

== In Fortress mode ==

Questers behave much like [[agent]]s, only in less-covert ways, usually acting as a warrior of some kind. They will arrive as [[Visitor|visiting]] mercenaries to your fortress, inquiring about an artifact's whereabouts at your [[tavern]] and chatting with the locals or other visitors. If you don't have that artifact, they will use the [[rumor]] system used by [[diplomat]]s and other visitors to find out where to go next. If you do have it, and its presence is confirmed (because, say, one of your dwarves mindlessly opens their mouth about it), one of the following may happen:

*They may openly demand that you hand it to them. Failure to comply may result in one of the dire consequences below.
*They may leave, sneak back in and attempt to steal it. If discovered, they may run away or fight back, depending on their temperament

*They may leave... and come back with an army to persuade you.

Depending on the quester's parent entity, failure to comply with a quester's demand may eventually escalate the situation, until a full-blown [[siege]] occurs.

Note that if everyone knows about your fortress holding an artifact, questers may simply directly sneak in and try to steal it, without going through your tavern.  If you ''don't'' have a tavern, they will directly attempt a theft, or demand that you hand it to them without confirmation. If you don't have it, you may tell them so, or you can just pick a fight, if you were looking for an excuse anyway.

== In Adventure mode ==

You may interact with questers you encounter (e.g. helping them by giving them what they seek, or looting their equipment as they report back to their parent entity), or become a quester yourself. Accomplishing quests increases your [[reputation]], though keep in mind that several actors may lay a [[claim]] to the same artifact, so satisfying one party will necessarily alienate the other. Alternatively, if you've successfully retrieved an artifact, and it happens to be ''very'' useful (such as [[steel]] equipment of the highest quality) nothing prevents you from keeping it for yourself and disappearing.
