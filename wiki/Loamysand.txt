'''Loamy sand''' is one of the many types of [[soil]] that can be found in [[soil layer]]s. Loamy sand layers in areas with poor [[biome|drainage]] occasionally contain an [[aquifer]].  It is not to be confused with [[sandy loam]].

Despite its name, it can ''not'' be used as a source of [[sand]] for [[glassmaking]].
