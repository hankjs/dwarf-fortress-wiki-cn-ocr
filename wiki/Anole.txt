'''Anoles''' are a species of unremarkable [[vermin]] who inhabit [[tropical]] [[forest]]s. They can be captured by [[trapper]]s and turned into [[pet]]s. All anoles are born with Legendary [[skill]] in [[Climber|climbing]].

Some [[dwarf|dwarves]] [[Preferences|like]] anoles for their ''dewlaps'' and their ''ability to change color''.
