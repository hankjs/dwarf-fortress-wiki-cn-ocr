'''Giant anoles''' are the [[giant animal]] versions of the common [[anole]] who inhabit [[savage]] [[tropical]] [[forest]]s. While their original counterparts are just [[vermin]], these [[creature]]s are over 3 times bigger than a [[dwarf]]. They are not particularly aggressive, but are not benign and will attack other creatures (including dwarves) who provoke them, potentially killing them. All giant anoles are born with Legendary [[skill]] in [[Climber|climbing]].

Giant anoles can be captured in [[cage]] [[trap]]s and [[Animal trainer|trained]] into [[pet]]s, possessing the standard giant creature pet value. They are born adults and cannot be permanently tamed. They produce an adequate amount of products when [[butcher]]ed and may be placed in a [[nest box]] to lay [[egg]]s, however they only lay 1 to 2 eggs at a time, making them very poor animals for [[egg production]]. Additionally, giant anoles are noticeably short-lived, only living up to 7 years at most. They are exotic [[mount]]s and may be witnessed being ridden by [[Elf|elves]] during [[siege]]s.

Some dwarves [[Preferences|like]] giant anoles for their ''dewlaps'' and their ''ability to change color''.
