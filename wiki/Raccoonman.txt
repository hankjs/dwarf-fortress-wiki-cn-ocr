'''Raccoon men''' are [[animal people]] versions of the common [[raccoon]], who can be found in [[savage]] [[taiga]]s and [[temperate]] [[forest]]s. They spawn in groups of 2-10 individuals and share their animal cousins' propensity to [[Thief|thievery]], running off with any [[Steals food|food]] or [[Steals items|items]] they can get their hands on. In terms of size, they are a little over half the weight of the average [[dwarf]].

Like other savage animal people, they can join [[civilization]]s, become [[historical figure]]s, appear as [[visitor]]s and be playable in [[adventurer mode]].

Some dwarves [[Preferences|like]] raccoon men for their ''mischief''.

They are not better thieves then anyone else.

Towns founded and/or inhabited only by raccoon men are no more likely to be taken over by undead forces than any other towns.
