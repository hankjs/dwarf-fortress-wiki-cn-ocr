[[File:hatch_cover_preview.png|right]]A '''hatch cover''' (also called a '''floor hatch''' or just '''hatch''') is, in effect, a [[door]], but controlling the passage between Z-levels instead of along the same Z-level. They can be placed over [[stairs]] or [[ramp]]s, or open space as long as they are supported by an adjacent floor tile.

Like doors, they can be linked with [[mechanism]]s, or locked [[File:Button door forbid.png]]. When closed, hatches appear as {{Raw Tile|¢|0:7:1}}; they are not visible when open. A hatch cover's color is determined by the [[material]] it is made from.

As [[building destroyer]]s can only destroy buildings on other z-levels under [[Building destroyer#Destroying from underneath|certain conditions]], hatch covers can be quite effective at keeping out enemies if used properly.

They can be constructed from a [[Stoneworker's workshop]], [[Metalsmith's forge]], [[Carpenter's workshop]], or [[Glass furnace]] from [[stone]], [[metal]], [[wood]], or [[glass]] respectively. Once built, they may be placed with {{menu icon|b|p|h}}.

A dwarf falling down stairs will be stopped by a closed floor hatch. A dwarf standing on a floor hatch over stairs will not start falling if the hatch is opened. A dwarf standing on a floor hatch above a ramp or open space will start falling if the hatch is opened. While the falling dwarf may be able to climb to escape injury, he will drop any items he was hauling, possibly injuring dwarves below.

If a hatch cover is placed over a hole (natural or [[channel]]ed), a [[garbage dump]] designated on the hatch will cause items to be dumped in a pile on top of the hatch. If the hatch is subsequently opened (by means of a triggered mechanism), the items will fall into the hole. If the hatch is opened at the time of dumping, the items will be thrown directly into the hole.

If a garbage dump is designated ''next to'' a hole with a hatch cover on it, the behavior depends on the state of the hatch cover. If the hatch cover is not linked to a mechanism at all, items will be piled on the hatch cover. If the hatch cover is linked and opened, the items will be thrown directly into the hole. If the hatch cover is linked and closed, the items will be piled on the ground (in the garbage dump tile).

== Forging and Melting ==

* Metal hatch covers cost '''three''' [[metal]] bars to [[forge]], or '''nine''' [[adamantine]] wafers.
* When a non-adamantine metal hatch cover is [[melt|melted down]], it will return '''1''' metal bar, for an '''efficiency of 33%'''.
* When an adamantine hatch cover is melted down, it will produce '''1''' wafer, for an '''efficiency of 11%'''.

== Adventurer mode ==

Hatch covers are common building elements in generated [[dungeon]]s, [[lair]]s, and other structures.  When placed above stairs, adventurers can use the ordinary stair-climbing commands {{k|<}} and {{k|>}} to traverse them.  On the other hand, when placed above ramps—as is typical of lairs and towers in [[keep]]s and [[dark pit]]s—the player must instead use {{k|Alt}}-direction while standing adjacent to or directly under a hatch cover in order to pass through it.  (Alternately, {{k|Ctrl}}-direction and {{k|Shift}}-direction may be used when above or below a hatch cover, respectively, as well.)
