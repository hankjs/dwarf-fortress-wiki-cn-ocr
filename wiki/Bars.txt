[[File:vertical_bars_sprite_preview.png|right]]'''Vertical bars''' and '''floor bars''' consist of a lattice of strong bars that prevent the passage of everything but fired (not falling) [[ammunition]], [[liquid]]s, items being pushed by liquids, and [[Tile attributes|low levels of light]]. Bars can be used vertically as transparent walls or on a flat surface as floor grates. Note that [[grate]]s are functionally almost identical to bars. 

Bars are most commonly used to seal open [[aqueduct]]s intended for the passage of [[water]], or [[magma]] if they are built from [[magma-safe]] materials, whether to keep dwarves from falling in or to keep [[fire imp]]s from invading through them. In this role they are similar to [[fortification]]s, which can also be used for the same purpose, except that bars can be destroyed by [[building destroyer]]s (fortifications cannot). It is recommended to cover any exposed waterways with bars (floor bars do not block [[fishing]] or taking water directly from a [[activity zone#Water_Source|water source]]) to prevent [[insanity|melancholy]] dwarves from contaminating your water supply, although this might not help that much: [[well]]s, unfortunately, cannot be Barred (However, CAN be [[grate]] d! if the grate is a level between the well and the water).

Bars can also be fired through like fortifications by [[Marksman|marksdwarves]] and [[siege|enemies]] alike, and provide no protection for either (unlike [[fortification]]s). Be warned that [[building destroyer]]s can and will destroy any vertical bars that block their path into your fortress. Due to a bug where any creature can simply pass through fortifications with impunity, bars and grates make for the best means of keeping enemies out (and your suicidally melee obsessed markdwarves in); bugs notwithstanding, they only have a small advantage over fortifications in that they can be linked to a [[lever]] or [[pressure plate]], allowing them to retract when the [[mechanism]] is activated.

Floor bars, like floor grates, will catch ammunition that is already falling. Ammunition that has missed its target will not start falling, unless it strikes a wall while over empty space. In other words, bars or grates (or simply floor) can be used to catch ammunition one z-level beneath from a hole, but if a grate or bar is placed at the surface of the hole, ammunition will simply be destroyed rather than falling.

== Placement ==
Bars can be built via the {{menu icon|b|n}} menu by a dwarf with the [[Hauling#Furniture_hauling|furniture hauling]] labor, and take one [[bar]] of any [[metal]] to build. They can be constructed as either "vertical Bars" with {{menu icon|b|n|M}} or horizontal "floor Bars" {{menu icon|b|n|m}}. Floor bars are intended to be built over open Space, though it is possible to build them directly on top of an existing floor (mainly useful for increasing [[room value]]).
