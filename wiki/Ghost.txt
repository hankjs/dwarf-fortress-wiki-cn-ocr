{{DFtext|Urist McGhost, Ghostly Cheesemaker has risen and is haunting the fortress!|4:1}}
[[File:ghost_v50_preview.png|right]]
'''Ghosts''' {{Tile|Ñ|7:1}} are a type of [[night creature]] and the spiritual essence of an intelligent [[creature]]. Up to 3 months after the death of an intelligent creature (such as a [[dwarf]]) who is a member of your [[civilization]], its soul may come back as a ghost, that will proceed to haunt the place of its death. In a dwarven fortress, dead dwarves have a chance of returning as ghosts if they are not properly [[coffin|buried]] or [[memorial|memorialized]] after their death. Ghosts often take to haunting their relatives and friends, following them around on the same tile, as well as lingering wistfully near areas they frequented in life or the spot they died. Some even continue to perform their jobs.{{bug|6354}} However, not all ghosts bear their anguish calmly. When a spirit has finally been calmed, the following message appears:<br>
{{DFtext|Urist McGhost, Ghostly Cheesemaker has been put to rest.|5:1}}

[[File:ghost_announcement_icon.png|left]]Ghosts are able to pass through walls, doors, floors, and other impassable tiles. They can open [[hatch]]es (even when [[mechanism|mechanically-linked]]{{bug|8458}}) and unlock any locked [[door]]s that they happen to pass through{{bug|4773}}. Ghosts may block [[building]] construction{{bug|6417}} and [[immigrant]] arrival.{{bug|5568}}

Ghosts are generally immune to harm (except for a few [[#Science on Ghosts|bugs]]). They can be targeted in the Squad kill screen ({{menu icon|q}} > choose squad > [[File:Interface squad attack.jpg]]) even though they won't actually be attacked. Ghosts can be dismissed by burying the remains, or by engraving and building [[memorial]]s in memory of the deceased. Ghosts of [[visitor]]s will eventually choose to "leave" the site once their "visit" timer expires.

Graphically, ghost sprites will appear as individuals with bright green skin if they are one of the main races - other creatures in ghost form, such as animal people, will appear as their standard sprite with no alterations.

==Paranormal Activity==
[[File:ghost_elf_anim.gif|thumb|151px|right|Ghostly elf phasing in and out of view.]][[File:ghost_portrait.png|thumb|right|Portrait of a ghostly human.]]Ghosts haunting the fortress will occasionally perform some of the following actions, based on their temperament:
* ''<ghost> sucks the wind out of <dwarf>''
* ''<ghost> raises a high fever in <dwarf>''
* ''<ghost> makes <dwarf> convulse and retch''
* ''<ghost> inflicts excruciating pain upon <dwarf>''
* ''<ghost> causes a spell of dizziness in <dwarf>''
* ''<ghost> paralyzes <dwarf>''
* ''<ghost> stuns <dwarf>''
* ''<ghost> batters <dwarf>''
* ''<dwarf> is throwing a tantrum, possessed by <ghost>''
* ''<ghost> is following <dwarf>''
* ''<item> has been misplaced. No doubt <ghost> is to blame!''
* ''<ghost> is throwing objects around the fortress!''
* ''<ghost> can be heard howling throughout the fortress!''

The ghost's activities may be determined by the nature of its death and its [[personality trait]]s using the following table, ''in order'':

A "high" trait check will succeed 20% of the time for value of 76-90, 50% of the time for 91-99, and is guaranteed for 100. Similarly, a "low" trait check will succeed 20% of the time for 10-24, 50% of the time for 1-9, and always for 0. Because the Murderous Ghost check has higher priority, having zero ALTRUISM will always result in a Murderous Ghost, never a Sadistic Ghost.

If a ghost is put to rest and subsequently re-raised (by deconstructing its coffin or slab), it will eventually return as a Murderous Ghost.

{{D for Dwarf}}
<!-- Reference: "Phasmophobia" video game -->

Dwarven ghosts would likely be classified as Wraiths by modern ghost hunters, as they can travel through walls; and they are not known to leave fingerprints, reduce the ambient temperature around them, or write disturbing messages in nearby books.

==Adventurer mode==
If you revisit your fortress during [[adventurer mode]], the ghosts found previously will still remain. Take care! The ghosts may attempt to 'scare you to death' almost instantly. Note that creatures with {{token|NOFEAR}} are immune to this attack.

Note that only Murderous, Sadistic, and Violent Ghosts are dangerous in Adventurer mode - all others are completely harmless.

=="Ghostly" Dwarves==
When a dwarf dies and becomes a ghost, its Legends mode entry lists it as a "ghostly" dwarf. All actions taken by the dwarf during both life and death will then be attributed to the ghostly dwarf. This will generate messages like "the ghostly dwarf Urist McHauntypants arrived in Cagesyrups" even when the dwarf was obviously not a ghost yet when it immigrated{{bug|5276}}.

== Science on Ghosts ==
[[File:ghost_nonsolid.png|thumb|120px|right|A ghost phasing through the ground.]]
*[[Cave-in]]s do not kill ghosts, perhaps because they can walk through walls already.
*Ghosts can suffer bruises and even organ rupture if struck by a minecart.
*Ghosts can only be put to rest by burial when at least '''half''' (rounded up) of their remaining body parts are put in a burial receptacle. For example, should a dwarf be chopped into 5 or 6 pieces, at least 3 of them will need to be placed inside their coffin in order for their spirit to be at rest. Any body parts which have been ''destroyed'' (e.g. by falling into [[magma]] or being crushed beneath a [[drawbridge]]) no longer count toward this total, but at least ''one'' body part must be interred.
*Ghosts can open [[door]]s, even forbidden ones (leaving them unlocked).
*Ghosts can and will grow up (if they came back as children) and die of old age.
*Ghosts are unharmed when frozen in [[water]], but will be stuck there if they happen to have an item.
*Ghosts can be murdered by dwarves taken by [[Strange mood|fell moods]] (in a futile attempt to use their body to create the artifact). This is also amusing because when you look at a ghost's wounds with {{Adv menu icon|k}}, all body parts are listed grey, meaning that they are gone. The affected dwarf will then kill another dwarf, because they didn't get the materials they needed for the construction.{{bug|4681}}
*It is possible for a ghost to become the [[outpost liaison]] of a civilization.
*Ghostly [[Fisherdwarf|fisherdwarves]] will keep fishing in the afterlife, and ghostly [[animal trainer]]s [http://www.bay12forums.com/smf/index.php?topic=127659 will gladly train your captured animals for you.]{{bug|6354}}
*When a ghost rises, their entry in the Dead/Missing list will change accordingly. So, should a dead [[cook]] return as a ghost, their profession in the Dead/Missing list will turn into "Ghostly Cook".
*If a dwarf goes missing, is not memorialized, and returns as a ghost, the entry for the dwarf in the Dead/Missing list will become "Deceased".
*Ghosts may disappear suddenly, and if they do, their entry in the Dead/Missing list will disappear as well. When they are put to rest in this state, their entry will reappear.
*Ghosts will occasionally claim built burial receptacles as tombs for themselves. These tombs must be unassigned before anything can be placed within them.
*Male ghosts are considered [[gelder|geld]]ed.
*Ghosts can go [[insane]].
*When ghosts batter your dwarves, their arms turn into absurdly sharp [[clear glass]] blades (with [[Weapon token#ATTACK|contact area of 10,000 and penetration size of 100,000]]).
*It is possible for a civilised [[intelligent undead]] to turn into a ghost. In order to be ghostified, the creature needs to leave the map. Assigning the undead to a squad and sending it on raids seems to do the trick, as eventually, the intelligent undead's ghost will rise. The risen ghost will not be interactable, but will still be part of the military. This behaviour can be exploited further to resurrect the undead back into its original creature form. Here's how to do it: keep the undead's ghost in a squad, and send this squad on another mission. While the squad is off-map, engrave a memorial slab to the ghost and place it down - when the squad comes back, your undead should now be alive, and its skills will have persisted.
*It is possible for ghosts to be captured in a (lead?) cage.
*It is possible for ghosts to haunt your fortress under fake names, which can make properly memorializing them more difficult, and necessitate a slab engraved to the ''correct'' identity.

== Playing as a ghost ==
{{mod}}
Using external utilities like [[DFHack]]'s <code>ghostly</code> command, it is possible to turn your [[adventure mode|adventurer]] into a ghost. When playing as a ghost, you will be able to pass through walls, but only if you have no items in inventory. Other creatures will ignore you, as they can't harm you and you will be unable to (directly) attack them, either. (Your character's ability to perform a suitable [[interaction token|interaction]], like poison gas, fire breath, or a directly applied [[syndrome]], however. is quite different...) Flying as a ghost seems to have some issues, because your ghostly adventurer will become stuck in mid-air forever, unless they are a creature that can normally fly. Other aspects of the game seem to work as usual.
