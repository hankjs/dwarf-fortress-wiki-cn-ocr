'''Giant badgers''' are [[giant animal]] variants of the common [[badger]], found in a wide variety of [[savage]] [[biome]]s. Like the regular badger, these animals are prone to rage and may randomly flip out in a berserk fury, very much badgering anything unfortunate enough to cross their path. Giant badgers are roughly the size of an [[elk]], or 5 times larger than a [[dwarf]], and as such will make quick work of civilians and a poorly trained, poorly equipped militia. Like their common cousins, they also tend to spawn in large clusters of 4-12 individuals, making them exponentially more dangerous if multiple badgers decide to get peeved together close to your dwarves or especially if the local badger population is [[Creatures#Agitation|agitated]].

Giant badgers can be captured in [[cage]] [[trap]]s and [[Animal trainer|trained]] into exotic [[pet]]s, possessing the default giant animal value. Their large size translates into a good amount of products if they are [[butcher]]ed, and you may also be inclined to use these huge, angry mustelids in your [[fortress defense]]. Like all giant animals, they are considered exotic [[mount]]s.

Some dwarves [[Preference|like]] giant badgers for their ''underground communities'' and their ''striped faces''.

{{D for Dwarf}}
Giant badgers used to be the [[king of beasts]] of 0.31.25 due to appearing frequently in temperate biomes and ripping apart young fortresses mercilessly. Now they are noticeably less common.

Giant badgers spawn in small groups of 4-12 individuals, apparently harmless - but this is merely a facade. As fury takes them, they will fall unto your fortress in a fury of claws and teeth.

Be warned. They are still here. Lurking.
