[[File:deity_icon_preview.png|200px|right]]A '''deity''' is a supernatural being or force of nature in the mythology of a world. Deities are overarching figures of the game's world, and are randomly generated during [[World generation|worldgen]], along with their corresponding [[divine metal]] and assigned different [[sphere]]s (the objects, creatures, concepts, etc. they are associated with). [[Religion|Religious]] [[creature]]s may worship one or more deities. Though deities remain unseen in standard gameplay, they are powerful, influential overarching forces behind a large amount of factors in the game.

Worship of deities correlates to what [[civilization]] a creature belongs to. [[Civilization#Mountain|Mountain]] and [[Civilization#Plains|plains]] civilizations worship multiple deities, most of which are often depicted as being of their main species, though, on occasion, they may worship a deity that is depicted as an [[animal]] or [[vermin]]. [[Religion]]s are able to spread across multiple civilizations. [[Civilization#Forest|Forest]] civilizations do not worship deities, and instead believe in a particular [[force]] amongst multiple such that permeate the forests. [[Civilization#Evil|Evil]] and [[Civilization #Skulking|skulking]] civilizations, meanwhile, do not worship anything by default. Because worship is denoted by civilization, it is possible for elves, goblins, or [[animal people]] who have joined a religious civilization to worship their deities.

''Note:'' Despite his meta importance, [[Armok]] doesn't actually exist as an in-game deity.

== Deities of your World ==
The easiest way to see what deities exist in your fortress is to create a zone > meeting area > temple, and then that screen will list the different deities that your current dwarves worship. A mouse-hover will show how many citizens worship a certain deity, plus a list of the deity's [[Sphere|spheres of influence]].

Although it has little effect on the game in fortress mode, fuller descriptions of the various gods can be read in [[legends mode]].

==Fortress mode==
Each dwarf, and many other creatures ({{token|INTELLIGENT}}/{{token|CAN_LEARN}}+{{token|CAN_SPEAK}} ''at least, such was presumably the intent''), have one or more deities listed among their [[relationship]]s. Almost all dwarves believe in at least one deity; most in two, and some, three. In the case of your dwarves, you can see the degree of belief they profess (''"faithful worshipper"'', ''"casual worshipper"'', etc.). Praying to deities is one of the most common ways a dwarf can fulfil their [[need]]s.

[[Fortress mode]] includes [[temples]] that can be dedicated to individual deities. The deities are also represented in [[statue]]s, [[engraving]]s and [[figurine]]s.

==Adventurer mode==
[[File:deity_view.png|thumb|240px|right|Deity seen before the game begins.]]Adventurers can select a deity or religion to follow during character creation, and choosing for them to be more than a casual worshipper will add the [[need]] to pray, which can be satisfied by {{Adv menu icon|k}} [[talking]] to them. Joining a [[religion]] or assuming an [[Name#Other names/false identities|identity]] will allow you to worship new gods.

In [[adventurer mode]], [[site]]s such as [[Monastery|monasteries]], fortresses, and human towns may contain [[temple]]s of various designs, possibly inhabited by [[priest]]s dedicated to a deity - if a worshipper of that deity were to desecrate a statue at that temple, there may be [[Cursed|consequences]]. Shrines may also be found at those and other types of sites where [[dice]] can be found, which can be rolled to maybe gain a boon or curse.

If the player selects the "Chosen" type of adventurer, they will be connected to a deity with a destiny that must be fulfilled. Before the game begins, a portrait of the deity will be seen, explaining their quest to the adventurer. Selecting this path will have a deity as the adventurer's parent or supporting patron.

==Interaction in the world==
{{imagefix|[[File:Announce dietycurse icon.png|left]]|5}}
Deities occasionally influence events during world generation.  Gods of death can create slabs, from which [[necromancer]]s learn the secrets of life and death. Furthermore, civilized creatures that profane a temple of the deity they worship incur the wrath of their former patron, being turned into a [[vampire]] or [[werebeast]] as punishment (even though being [[Immortality|immortal]] is not really a punishment to some).

{{Spoiler}}

Deities may occasionally collaborate with a [[demon]], raising it up from the underworld with a ritual conducted by an [[artifact]] [[slab]]. This is, in fact, exactly how said demons escape the [[Underworld]] and gain status in the mortal world. What demon in question is summoned, as well as the reason for this, appears to be linked to the god's particular [[sphere]]. For example, gods of death may summon demons "that more may die"; war-gods conduct the ritual "that war may rage forever" or "that great fortresses be raised and tested in siege". Gods of bravery and valor, meanwhile, do the same "that great acts of heroism may be performed." (Admittedly, anyone who can navigate a demonic site and come out alive should rightfully be called more than a great hero!)

Deities are served by [[angel]]s, randomized creatures who may wield equipment made of impossibly strong [[divine metal]] created by the deity. Angels are best known for guarding the contents of [[vault]]s, the treasure-houses of allied [[demon]]s; they may be the most exceedingly powerful and dangerous creatures in ''Dwarf Fortress'', more so than even demons. Successfully raiding a vault is a feat on par with conquering the Underworld—you may use the knowledge on the vault's slab all you want, but it's a tiny reward compared to vanquishing ''the forces of Heaven itself''.

== A world without deities ==
{{mod}}
Deities can be removed from the game through [[Entity token|modding entity raws]], by making all civilizations become areligious. In such a world, demonic leaders thrust the spire of slade by themselves, and place the slab in a vault created on their own. The vault is then left unguarded, since no [[angel]]s can exist without deities.

Removing deities makes [[vampire]]s, [[werebeast]]s, and [[necromancer]]s never spawn, as these can (currently) only be created through divine intervention.

== Physically summoning deities into the world ==

{{mod}}

Deities don't usually manifest themselves physically in vanilla DF, but they can be helped with a [http://www.bay12forums.com/smf/index.php?topic=164123.msg8361144#msg8361144 DFHack script]. The script doesn't just create a unit that 'looks' like the deity, it actually pulls the [[historical figure]] info from the deity and creates a [[nemesis]] record to link it to the newly created unit. Use with caution.

A deity will use the {{Raw tile|Ä}} tile instead of their corresponding creature tile.
