'''Bone carver''' is the skill related to the processing of [[bone]]s, [[skull]]s, and other non-[[food]] animal products.

==Fortress mode==
In fortress mode, bone carvers make [[bone]], [[shell]], [[ivory|ivory/tooth]], [[horn]] and [[pearl]] [[finished goods|goods]] at a [[craftsdwarf's workshop]]. These include bone [[bolt]]s for [[crossbow]]s, lightweight bone and shell [[armor]], and [[totem]]s from [[skull]]s. Bone carvers can also [[decorate]] [[furniture]] and goods with these materials.

==Adventure mode==
Your adventurer can practice bone carving without a workshop simply by standing over a pile of bone, pressing {{k|x}} to open the crafting menu, choosing "Carve Bone", and selecting an item to produce. This process requires you to be holding an edged tool or weapon. Only [[jewelry]], [[figurine]]s, and cut bone "[[gem]]s" can currently be produced this way, none of which have any major use except for trading (or, more obviously, training misc. object user). However, doing so ''does'' train [[attributes|agility, spatial sense, and kinesthetic sense]], all of which are useful combat attributes.
