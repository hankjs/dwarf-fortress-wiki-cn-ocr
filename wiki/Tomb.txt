[[File:tomb_preview.png|right]]A '''tomb''' ([[File:icon_site_tomb.png]] / {{Raw Tile|0|0:0:1}}) is a resting place for the [[corpse|dead]]. "Tomb" has several meanings in the game: it can refer to a [[site]], a [[structure]], or a [[zone]].

== Fortress mode ==
A tomb is a [[zone]] in which [[dwarf|dwarves]] ([[File:Interface dwarf face.jpg|26px]]) and pets ([[File:Interface tomb pet.png|26px]]) can be buried. A tomb can be assigned to a specific dwarf, or to accept dwarves and/or pets for burial. A tomb zone can only accommodate '''one''' dwarf. The primary function of tombs is to keep [[noble]]s [[thought|happy]]: certain nobles demand their own tomb, and the more self-important the noble is, the higher the [[Zone#Quality_and_value|quality]] they will require. In some circumstances a [[noble]] will get an unhappy [[thought]] if an "inferior" dwarf has a higher-quality tomb, however it is unclear what quality threshold the tomb must be to trigger the thought. Nobles may also store certain favored objects in their tombs.

The [[Zone#Quality_and_value|quality]] levels of tombs go as follows:
{| class = "wikitable"

[[File:df_tomb_dead.png|thumb|190px|A mummy surrounded by potential minions.]]Dwarves that have been assigned to tombs will retain all of their possessions when they die, and other dwarves will place them in the tomb - it can be a good idea to keep a [[chest]] or [[cabinet]] in the tomb to ensure that all of the items fit; otherwise, all of the dwarf's possessions will be inherited by their [[marriage|spouse]] (if one exists) or simply become unowned.

Making a tomb for every dwarf in your fortress can be time-consuming – more convenient than creating tombs for common dwarves, is to create a crypt -- one large room with many coffins and a tomb zone for ''each'' coffin. A dwarf who dies will be placed in a random available tomb, unless they have a tomb assigned to them specifically. Creating one large tomb with multiple coffins similar to a [[barracks]] will not work; doing so will cause one coffin to be used and the rest to remain empty. This strategy of creating a crypt reduces negative thoughts, eliminates [[miasma]], and stops dead dwarves rising as [[ghost]]s. Of course, it's also important to make sure that the dwarf doing the burial isn't running into the middle of a battlefield to do so.

== Adventure mode ==
[[File:MagmaTomb.png|thumb|right|It is the dream of every dwarf – whether King of the Mountain Home or lowly peasant – to sleep in the blood of the Mountain forever.]][[Human]]s will build structures known as tombs, where they entomb their rulers and military leaders along with various treasures. They can be found underneath [[town]]s via [[catacombs]], or above-ground in specially constructed sites, which are also called tombs and marked as {{Raw Tile|0|0:0:1}} on the world map. Above-ground tombs take the form of pyramids or towers that vary in size (small to enormous) and internal composition. The entrances are kept locked and have the option to be picked or bashed open. Bashing the door destroys it completely, while picking the lock just unlocks it (and cannot be performed if it was linked to a lever). Upon entering, trespassers will be greeted with a messaged [[slab]] with one of the following warnings:

* {{DFtext|Woe unto any that disturb the resting place of <name> / The <Law-giver/General> watches still.}}
* {{DFtext|Woe unto any that disturb the resting place of <name> / The <Law-giver/General> is with <deity> but watches still.}}

A tomb consists of rock chambers and hallways, with hidden [[weapon trap]]s randomly set on the floor. It is recommended to raise your [[observer]] skill to spot traps before walking on one and triggering it. Loot, such as weapons, clothes, and crafts can be found lying around. All items possess a +fine+ [[item quality|quality]] or more.

One of the rooms contains the royal chamber that has a single coffin placed at the center, with a grave slab nearby, and typically surrounded by a lot of skeletons. This coffin, if [[mummy|disturbed]], may quickly prove to be very [[fun]].

Tombs may host a number of [[artifact]]s, and, as such, can be [[raid]]ed in fortress mode. Doing so, however, is likely to provoke the ire of their residents.
