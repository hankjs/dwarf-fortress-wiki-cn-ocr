[[File:necromancer_sprite_preview.png|right]]'''Necromancers''' {{Tile|Ñ|5:1}} are [[immortal]] beings blessed with the [[secret]]s of life and death. These [[night creature]]s are [[magic]]-users who raise legions of [[undead]] and seclude themselves in [[Tower_(necromancy)|tower]]s. Most [[creatures]] that are necromancers will have their sprite appear with skin of a pale purple color; this skin color also appears on [[dungeon guardian]]s. [[Animal people]] will appear as they are, with no color palette changes.

==The Origin of Necromancers==
[[File:necromancer_revive_anim.gif|thumb|305px|right|Two fighting necromancers revive nearby corpses.]]Necromancers initially begin as normal [[historical figure]]s who are [[Creature_token#MAXAGE|mortal]], [[Creature_token#CAN_SPEAK|can speak]], [[Creature_token#CAN_LEARN| learn]] and are also part of an [[civilization|entity]]; in unmodded games these are [[dwarf|dwarves]], [[human]]s and civilized animal people. At some point in its life, one of these creatures may suddenly become [[Personality goal#IMMORTALITY|"obsessed with his/her/its own mortality"]] and seek to become immortal. Shortly afterwards, it will begin (if it does not do so already) worshiping a [[deity]] (or a creature with the  {{token|SUPERNATURAL|c}} tag) who has a [[sphere|DEATH sphere]]. Once the deity/supernatural creature becomes an object of ardent worship to the figure, it will reward the worshipper with an artifact [[slab]] containing the secrets of life and death, which is then swiftly claimed by the recipient for diligent learning, thus becoming a necromancer. This original necromancer may then take as apprentice(s) one or more fellow immortality-seekers, who will obtain the knowledge of their master. Sometimes, these slabs can be stored in [[structure|structures]] such as taverns or markets during world generation, leading to many random people learning the secrets of life and death.

==Description==
Having mastered the secrets of life and death, necromancers have reached their goal of [[immortality]], in that they do not [[age]], need to [[food|eat]], [[thirst|drink]], or require [[sleep]], as they [[No Exert|never get tired or exhausted]]. However, they ''do'' need to breathe, unlike [[vampire]]s. Necromancers are still fertile, and in fortress mode, female dwarf necromancers can give birth. Their {{token|ANXIETY_PROPENSITY|facet}} is raised by 50, while their {{token|TRUST|facet}} is lowered by 50, and some necromancer secrets add {{token|LIKES_FIGHTING}}.

The defining characteristic of necromancers is that they know the secrets of life and death, which gives them extra powers. However, not all secrets are created equal – different secrets will yield different powers.

== Secrets ==
Each secret gives a combination of magical abilities, which come in the form of [[interaction token]]s. These abilities may vary widely in type and power level, but will always include the ability to raise corpses and [[intelligent undead]]. Depending on their [[sphere]]s (which stem from the spheres of the original [[deity]] that granted those secrets) secrets may also grant the ability to summon [[nightmare]]s, [[bogeymen]], and also the ability to "ghoulify" a living creature (in effect, giving it a [[syndrome]] that turns it into a [[thrall]], much like [[evil]] clouds). In addition, the intelligent undead will also be granted powers of their own, which may range from raising blisters to rotting nerves, to even being able to raise the dead themselves. The [[Advanced_world_generation#Number_of_Secret_Types|number of secrets]], and [[Advanced_world_generation#Allow_Divination.2C_Experiments.2C_and_Necromancy_types|which advanced powers]] they can convey, can be set in advanced world generation.

A single necromancer can learn multiple "strains" of necromancy by reading different sources. Ambitious necromancers tend to create more towers of the same strain via proxy, so you might find your world populated by a single strain. Usually, it's easier when you know which tower houses what kind of undead, or when you go after the source slabs via legends mode. Recovery is also easier when you have a sneaky [[squad]] of artifact raiders in fort mode.

=== Raise corpse/intelligent undead ===
Necromancers always have the [[interaction token|power]] to animate [[corpse]]s of organic creatures, which can include heads or any body parts which have a {{token|GRASP|body}} token or are attached to body parts which do ([[skin]] and [[hair]]). Corpses must be within the necromancer's line of sight – about 15 tiles – to be animated. Necromancers do this by gesturing; raising of the dead is reported in the [[reports|combat log]]:

{{gametext|[Necromancer] gestures!|3:1}}
{{gametext|[Corpse] shudders and begins to move!|3:1}}

Once a dead being is animated, it will become [[Adventure mode#Companions|enslaved]] to the necromancer and {{token|OPPOSED_TO_LIFE}}, regardless of previous allegiances. Unless the necromancer attacks their new undead minions, they will remain companions in Adventure mode. If you are a necromancer and attack one of your undead companions, all of them will turn neutral. Animated corpses are also neutral toward creatures that are {{token|NOT_LIVING}}.  Necromancers will also, occasionally, revive corpses as [[intelligent undead]] – in this case, the revived creature will retain most of its personality and existing loyalties. The name "undead" never quite appears as such in the game – instead, a procedurally-generated name like "lost butcher" or "risen zombie" is used. These undead have special powers but won't be enslaved or {{token|OPPOSED_TO_LIFE}}. In fortress mode, this means that intelligent undead raised by necromancer citizens of your fortress will stay citizens if they were such when they died. It also means putting necromancers in military squads is very risky, as they might accidentally revive your enemies with fun new powers. In adventure mode, if you attempt to raise someone you killed as an intelligent undead, they will remember you attacked and killed them, and will be hostile to you.

=== Summon [[nightmare]]s/[[bogeymen]] ===
Secrets aligned with the nightmare sphere will grant the ability to summon nightmares or bogeymen at a random location near the target to haunt it. In-game, necromancers with this ability will "call upon the night" to do so. These summons are large and freakish, but last a short amount of time. Nightmares are neutral toward creatures with {{token|NOFEAR}}.

=== Ghoulification ===
Certain necromancers may also turn living creatures into [[infected ghoul]]s. The victims will be said to have "been infected with a contagious ghoulish condition". In adventure mode, you cannot make ghouls even if the announcement after reading a secret-containing book says you learned the power. Ghouls are opposed to life and attack/infect all living creatures who aren't ghouls through bites. They still retain their sentience and can still bleed to death, but they maintain their gear and abilities, are immune to drowning, do not tire, and have extravision.

== In world generation ==
{{imagefix|[[File:df_necromancer_portrait.png|right]]|8|6}}[[File:Secrets.png|thumb|Secrets of life and death.]]In world generation, necromancers may raise suspicions from their fellow citizens due to not aging, which can lead them to be expelled. This does not apply to necromancers living in goblin and elven civilizations, since both goblins and elves are already immortal. Upon being expelled, the necromancer may form a grudge against the civilization and turn to [[villain]]y, and they will generally take refuge in a site of their own.

Necromancers who have a sufficient following may use their undead minions to build dark [[Tower (necromancy)|tower]]s, a task that requires at least 50 followers; younger necromancers may take over [[town]]s or camps instead. Necromancers will also raise a few [[intelligent undead]] as lieutenants. The building of a tower is carried out by the original necromancer of a group (the one who was given the slab) as apprentices join the group after the tower is built. Therefore, each necromancy group has one tower.

Necromancers can make zombies build their tower up a bit to increase the site's zombie cap. If the necromancer is at their zombie cap, they can still raise more zombies, but they are added to a 'wilderness population' instead. The wilderness population can still be used for invasions, but they are also able to roam on to player forts in the region and also encounter adventurers. 

Necromancers may conduct horrible [[experiment]]s on civilians and their [[domestic animal|livestock]], turning them into night creatures known as experiments. Eventually, these experiments may leave the necromancer that made them and join other civilizations. In older worlds, many civilizations will likely have significant populations of escaped experiments. In adventure mode, it is not currently possible to create necromancer experiments.

Necromancers can also turn intelligent creatures into [[infected ghoul]]s. The ghouls can then be found around necromancer towers, but it is not currently possible to turn a creature into a ghoul in adventure mode.   

Since the secrets of life and death are generated with a {{token|MUNDANE_RECORDING_POSSIBLE|int}} tag, necromancers will often write numerous [[book]]s during world generation, some concern the secrets of life and death (''blessed, or mayhap, cursed'') so that anyone who reads them will become a necromancer. Like the slab, all (''first-edition, not copies'') books, even those that do not contain secrets, are considered [[artifact]]s, and as such can be viewed in the "Codices and scrolls" list in [[legends|legends mode]].

'''Books containing the secrets of life and death will include any of the following words in their title:''' (Note: "the End" can also turn up in mundane titles as well, typically as part of the phrase "after the end")
{{gamedata
|title=[[Speech file|Names]]
|{{#df_raw:v50:text_secret_death.txt}}
}}


It is possible to ensure that a world is generated devoid of necromancers by setting the '''Number of Secret Types''' to '''0''' in [[advanced world generation]]. Conversely, creating a world with a high number of secret types will increase the probability of there being multiple necromancers in the world. Since necromancers in unmodded games are usually humans or dwarves, having a large amount of neutral plains and/or mountains will further increase this probability, as it means that these civilizations will have more space to expand, and thus the amount of historical figures eligible for necromancy will increase.

Necromancer towers spread death-[[sphere|aligned]] [[evil]] regions around them. Destroying the tower and killing the necromancers in it (e.g. through a [[raid]] to raze the site) will reverse the evil-spreading.

Necromancer towers seem to be treated as a type of criminal government{{verify}} and as such, function similarly to a regular civilization. Necromancers from opposing entities will attack each other, but amusingly, their undead armies will be neutral to everyone. Due to their ability to amass large armies quickly, necromancers are currently one of the most powerful geopolitical forces in the game, often declaring war on and destroying even powerful goblin civilizations in older worlds.

==Fortress mode== 
===Sieges===
{{DFtext|The dead walk. Hide while you still can!|5:1}}
{{main|Siege#Necromancer sieges}}

Necromancers can lay [[siege]] to your fortress at any stage, including before the first [[immigration|migrant wave]], but only if their tower or town is within 20 tiles of your fortress. As such, picking a location within 20 tiles' distance of such a tower is regarded as a sure way to have an extra helping of [[fun]], and can be checked with {{k|tab}} during world gen. Note that if no tower is present during embark, no necromancer sieges will ever arrive (they may still show up as migrants and/or visitors), except if you [[mission|attack]] them. The sieges are structured much like normal sieges, except that the numbers tend to be much larger and much more disorganized, consisting not of individual squads but of masses of zombies coming from every side. The necromancer (or necromancers, if the former has an apprentice) may or may not arrive with the siege; if they do, and are captured or killed, you can expect to see no more activity from that particular tower. Undead are hostile to everything that breathes as well as to enemy necromancer hordes, meaning that other sieges or [[ambush]]es (or, indeed, caravans) that happen to arrive when a necromancer siege is milling about will always result in a battle. They may also send small squads or armies of experiments to attack you, sometimes stealthily accompanying their minions.

The easiest way to deal with a zombie siege is through the application of [[dwarven atom smasher|particle physics]] to grind the zombies into nothingness. Anything that obliterates any trace of the zombie will prevent raising; a drop into [[magma]] or [[semi-molten rock]] or encasing in [[obsidian]] are more creative alternatives. The jury is still out on whether slashing weapons are better or worse against necromancer sieges; although they tend to separate zombies into many parts, these parts can all be raised, leaving the question of whether the whole zombie or an arm here and a leg there is more dangerous. The undead that the necromancer(s) will bring will be sapient creatures, but if you killed some [[elephant]]s in a combat exercise and a necromancer happens upon them, the danger is magnified.

If you have a [[vampire]] and haven't walled them in yet, you can draft them and take a leisurely walk through town, as undead will ignore them (unless attacked), and the necromancer, has one arrived, is an easy, valid target for a clobbering.

===Ambushes===
Necromancers can arrive under cover, alone, in [[ambush]]es, and raise the dead without being seen. This is much more difficult, as you cannot see the necromancers in question, only their products. Potential necromancer ambushes can be dealt with by internalizing all corpse/remains stockpiles behind heavily trafficked areas, and posting sentries if possible.

===Residents/citizens===

Residents and citizens alike can also become necromancers if they happen to read material (such as [[codex|codexes]]/[[quire|quires]]) that contain the secrets of life and death. One way to acquire such materials is by trading for them from a [[caravan]].

Necromancers may occasionally arrive with their slab in hand. It is possible to add necromantic texts as part of your library, allowing you to turn your dwarves into necromancers once they read them. It is also possible to use the world map to send military squads to raid necromancer towers for the reading material contained in them. Dwarven necromancers no longer age, need to eat, or sleep, but they will also no longer need to drink, which can slow them down so much, the conversion may not be worth it.  They ''may'' also raise the occasional corpse, which will often attack non-necromancers, while this might not sound like a big deal if you already have a fort full of necromancer dwarves, the real [[fun]] comes when diplomats, trade caravans, and outpost liaisons show up and if you have the dead walking among your populace. Also, be wary of sending necromancers out in melee, as intelligent undead invaders may remain hostile to your necromancers, who are [https://www.reddit.com/r/dwarffortress/comments/znmm0u/this_necrodwarf_has_killed_the_same_elf_121_times/ ceaseless in bashing their heads in before killing them again in an endless, FPS-killing cycle.]

Another way of getting necromantic reading material into your library is to "liberate" it in adventure mode, or become a necromancer and [[Book#Writing|write]] it yourself, then drop the book off at a retired fortress. This can then be picked up by your dwarves to read at their leisure.

A necromancer may raise the dead when threatened, which is fun when your battlefield is full of previously hostile sentients. This is why you should almost always manually control the necromancer in fortress mode.

===Applications===
Necromancers can be made useful by applying them in [[training]] schemes. Necromancers trapped in a room with line of sight to, say, the contents of the corpse stockpile can be used to generate an infinite amount of hostile creatures to fight; when you get tired of the sport (or your dwarves start getting beaten up), simply block their line of sight with a bridge and put down the remaining enemies, and your military can walk out of training with more experience.

Capturing necromancers is simple: build a tunnel near the necromancer, link floodgates or bridges within so that it can be sealed off, and then poke a hole into the surface. Assuming the necromancer was the nearest creature to where you opened the tunnel, they will be the first one in, and you can then seal off the tunnel and trap them inside. It's difficult to get the necromancer in there alone, without a few zombies following, but it shouldn't matter. [[Cage trap]]s will work too; however, caged necromancers appear to no longer revive anything.  You must put necromancers on a restraint afterwards if you want them to be able to.

They can also be weaponized. Replace the militia training room with a room full of goblins, and fun will result. Upright spike [[trap]]s can "kill" the corpses after each use so that the resulting [[goblinite]] can be gathered, and the trap reused. Given enough time and enough bodies, such a trap can even best the [[HFS|circus]]. 

Much like [[vampire]]s, necromancers may seize control of a [[civilization]] and become its [[monarch|king/queen]]. In that case, the monarch in question must be isolated from any corpses, as ''they'' may be friendly, but the zombies they tend to create... will be of the dwarven-arm-ripping variety. They should either be isolated from the dead with a [[burrow]], or assigned to training/killing reanimation duties. Regardless, necromancers are very [[fun]].

===Visitors or immigrants===
[[File:necro_and_giant.png|thumb|260px|right|A hostile giant resurrected by a necromancer, making it cause ''more'' havoc on a fortress.]]Necromancers may also casually arrive as [[visitor]]s or [[immigrant]]s in your fortress. When visiting, they won't attack you or attempt to raise any corpse they see – they came to relax, and just happen to know the secrets of life and death (the visitors are normally, though not necessarily always, [[Villain|scheming something]]). They ''will'', however, use their powers in combat (for instance, if they enlist as mercenaries in your squads), but not necessarily mindless corpse-raising – they may revive one of your dwarves that just died as an [[intelligent undead]], who is loyal to your fortress and has extra powers. Necromancer immigrants can be put to work like any other immigrant dwarf – this may be bad for your meat supply when they practice their craft on the corpses produced by your hunters, however.

Unless one knows exactly what they're doing, it may be in the player's best interest not to put necromancers in their military, as they can – in a combat-induced panic – resurrect enemies that will continue harassing your fortress. Not only that, but due to the now-zombified enemy not feeling any pain and ''already'' being dead, it may take more effort to kill them. Again.

==Adventurer Mode==
In [[adventurer mode]], necromancers are most commonly found in towers {{Tile|I|5:0}}, but can, very rarely, be found in towns and camps, due to reasons explained earlier in this article. Towers will contain all the necromancers that are part of the necromancer group to whom the tower belongs, as well as a horde of undead. Towers require abundant human populations (low savagery, large tracts of neutral land) and a high number of secrets to be generated in world generation. Elves or goblins cannot become necromancers through normal means (bestowed by a death god) as their immortality means they cannot become obsessed with their own mortality. They can still learn the secrets of life and death by reading them, however.

Combat-wise, a necromancer is potentially quite dangerous due to their powers, and in their towers they frequently will have at least a small group of undead with them, more than likely a large one and potentially even a small army, and once they're in battle will animate anything capable of being animated within their line of sight, resulting in one of their more annoying habits of reanimating severed/detached parts of their zombies (including parts of the just-killed ones) while you're trying to carve or smash your way through their minions to get at them. Aside from their dark powers, however, necromancers themselves are always poor direct combatants that wear no armor or protection past their clothes, only have a dagger or knife for self-defense (sometimes they're even unarmed!), and have either non-existent or inconsequential combat skills. Provided you can reach them, they themselves can be slain with ease. 

It is possible to become a necromancer yourself in adventurer mode by [[reader|reading]] the slab, or one of the books containing the secrets of life and death. Both will be found on the tables scattered around the tower, often amongst a pile of other, less-useful books. 

So, becoming an immortal being who doesn't need to worry about petty things like eating, drinking and sleeping, and can also raise and control an undead army... merely requires you to read some slab or book. Sounds simple, doesn't it? Unfortunately, it isn't. The tower is stuffed with undead monstrosities who would probably like nothing better than to tear your poor adventurer to shreds. If that isn't bad enough, the necromancer(s) to whom the slab and books belong will raise their servants each time you strike them down, if they can see the corpses.

So, what can we do to get at those secrets? Well, there are methods:

* '''1. Storm the tower'''
This is probably the most obvious solution, and is also the most likely to get inexperienced adventurers killed. Once you have become powerful enough, attack the tower head-on, preferably bringing with you an army of <s>meatshields</s> soldiers (who will likely get themselves killed, but will provide a distraction for you). It is advisable for you to lure the undead out of the tower first, away from the necromancers' gaze. This will make dealing with them far easier, and will give you a lot more space to dodge (or run if things get bad). If a necromancer is in the midst of the horde, try to move around so that the necromancer is exposed, then go in for the kill. Proceed until everyone (excluding yourself) is dead. Alternatively, just run into the tower and begin hitting everything like a madman, or cutting a swath to the necromancer(s) and killing them before dealing with the undread. Eventually, either you or all of the tower's occupants will be dead. Then just take the slab/book and do what you will with it. 

* '''2. Sneaking'''
Since [[ambusher|sneaking]] in the current version basically makes you invisible{{verify}}, and due to the fact that lighting barely exists yet, sneaking into the tower with a high enough skill and [[thrower|throwing]] stuff will allow you to kill everyone with minimal damage done to yourself. There is, however, the risk of being spotted, in which case you are advised to run away as quickly as you can. Alternatively, you could try to sneak around the tower and steal the slab/book without killing anything, but, because of the high density of enemies in a tower, it is extremely likely that you will be spotted, swarmed and killed.

* '''3. Being a Night Creature'''
Visiting the tower as a [[night creature]] [[Faction#Faction relative hostility|to whom undead are friendly]], such as a [[vampire]], [[undead|husk/thrall]] or, of course, a fellow necromancer, is by far the easiest way to obtain the slab/a book. Seriously. The undead are {{token|OPPOSED_TO_LIFE}}, but these night creatures are {{token|NOT_LIVING}}, so they will ignore you completely. Since undead will not attack necromancers, making a mad dash for the slab/book is also a viable option, but you will risk being killed/severely wounded before you get the chance to become a necromancer. If you are already one of these night creatures, you can just skip gleefully past the undead, read the slab/book and get out. You may also want to have a chat with the necromancers, who are actually quite friendly once you get to know them. In fact, night creatures who are shunned by society will often still be accepted by necromancers, who you can even ask for [[Adventure mode#Quests|quests]]! That is, of course, unless you are an enemy of their group, in which case they will attempt to kill you. Be advised that you cannot become a necromancer as an [[experiment]].

* '''4. Fire. A lot of fire.'''
The undead hordes will not cross small fires. The aspiring adventurer can outrun undead, leading them away from the tower, then run for the entrance. If there are more undead inside, run away. Repeat this until the undead have emptied from the tower, outrunning them and herding them. Run to the tower entrance and light fires around it, sealing them out. Take your time, enjoy the books, maybe mess with a necromancer. When you're ready to leave, scale the wall or jump over the fire. Bonus points: completely enclose the undead in a fire circle they cannot escape from. Side note: while running from undead, igniting the grass in clever places will slow them down even further.

* '''5. Vampire recruit'''
Another strategy, which may not always be available but can work well, is recruiting a vampire. Undead creatures and vampires won't bother each other, but the vampire will attack any hostile necromancers present. Once the necromancers are all dead, you will be left with the far simpler task of killing the undead without having to worry about any of the corpses reanimating.

* '''6. Leapfrog'''
{{k|j}}umping is an often overlooked but fairly powerful combat tool, especially against large hordes of very stupid zombies. Huge numbers have no impact of how effective jumping is, and zombies don't really try all that hard to get out of your way. It's fairly easy to just leap through entire hordes of zombies until you get to the tower proper, at which point you can just dash up some stairs and wait a bit for the zombies to forget you. The actual sentient inhabitants of the tower are strangely hospitable (even to the living) and don't seem to mind you that much, although some experiments seem to turn aggressive if you try talking to them. Once you've found the secret the zombies have probably forgotten about you and will ignore you now that you're also a night creature, and any that still remember you can be dispatched easily without causing any more trouble.

===Playing as a necromancer===

As a necromancer, you:
*Don't need to eat or drink, so you don't need to worry about running out of food or water and can get rid of the extra weight. (Dwarves may still want to drink alcohol occasionally since the syndrome does not remove {{token|ALCOHOL_DEPENDENT|c}}.)
*Don't need to sleep, and can't get tired or exhausted, so you'll never again feel the negative effects of these statuses. Although there is a bug with this when retired at a player fortress that can leave them permanently tired.{{bug|8389}}
*Are immortal, as necromancers do not age. Your adventurer will not die of old age if your world reaches their natural {{token|MAXAGE|c}} (such as if you retire an adventurer and play fortress mode for a while).
*Can reanimate corpses to create undead companions. This can be done as many times as you want, with a small [[time]] limit between each reanimation, and only requires a corpse/body part. Multiple necromancer adventurers can also raise each other as [[intelligent undead]], gaining more powers.
*Can learn other necromancy secrets, collecting them and their powers.
*Can rarely summon other creatures like [[nightmare]]s and [[bogeymen]] if the deity that created the slab had the nightmare [[sphere]].
*Gain {{token|NO_PHYS_ATT_RUST|c}} and {{token|NO_PHYS_ATT_GAIN|c}} which freeze your physical [[attribute]]s so that they cannot rust or be increased. Therefore, it might be wise to raise them to a high level before becoming a necromancer.

==== Reanimating dead creatures ====
1.Open the actions menu by pressing {{k|X}}.<br />
2.Select "Animate corpse".<br />
3.Now move the cursor onto the corpse(s) you wish to animate, press the letter that they are represented by on the items screen (such as {{k|a}}) and press {{k|Enter}}. Note that you can animate more than one corpse at a time, and that you can also animate corpses that are in your inventory.<br />
[[File:Animatecorpsemenu.jpeg|thumb|right|Animate corpse menu from an [[DF2014:Necromancer|earlier version]].]]
In the Premium version, the powers, as well as their icons, will appear as the following:
{| class="wikitable" style="width:500px;"
|-

|}

It is worth noting that you can only raise corpses with intact heads or grasping body parts (hands). That is, if the creature's head and hands explode into gore, collapses into gore, or are otherwise "pulped" via damage to the head or torso, then that corpse cannot be raised. It is still possible, however, to raise a corpse that has had its head completely severed. The arms and head of a single individual can also be reanimated as different zombies, granted they are separated properly to begin with.

Besides acting as reusable and easily replenishable soldiers, undead hold potential usage as training dummies for weapon and wrestling skills and can be used to build for you, including animated body parts. A crafty adventurer may cut the limbs off their undead slaves and reanimate them, counting as an additional companion, and reducing build time. However, while a necromancer can still be friendly to mortals, its minions will attack everything living in sight.

For combat, because reanimated dead lose all their skills as well as the ability to learn, only the attributes and size of the creature at the time of their death are important.

As in Fortress mode, necromancer companions and NPCs will automatically raise the dead when in the heat of battle. To counter this in adventure combat, mangle a sentient being using a blunt weapon so they can never be raised, or butcher them once and mangle the raised skin. Butchering doesn't take time, so it doesn't hurt to immediately butcher someone you killed.

Alternatively, you can destroy someone's soul by raising a corpse as a mindless undead. This rewrites their faction and soul traits, and any subsequent resurrection will raise them as a soulless creature loyal to you. This is very useful when you are in mass combat.

Be warned that raising a corpse in front of a lot of people who are already in combat will cause a lag spike.

==[[Object testing arena]]==
Necromancy can be assigned to any creature by simply changing the "effect" of the spawned creature to "necromancer" by pressing {{k|u}}. As expected, necromancers will reanimate dead creatures and severed body parts, though, depending on which team the player has set for the spawned necromancer and that of any creature that died that said necromancer chose to resurrect, strange behaviors can occur.

For example, a necromancer revives the body parts of a dead, dismembered dwarf in an effort to aid itself in fighting, but because the dwarf was on the "independent" team (or just a different one from the necromancer), the body parts just end up attacking the necromancer that raised them. So said necromancer may end up killing what it resurrected, only to keep resurrecting what it just killed to fight it again, which can happen over and over in an endless loop – all due to the clashing of how the arena handles teams/sides and the necromancer's natural AI in raising the dead to help itself.

==Modding==
{{mod}}
It is entirely possible to create your own unique secret class, with powers ranging from material emission (fireballs, firebreath, [[Material definition token#SYNDROME|syndrome-inducing materials]]) to turning corpses into enthralled creatures, such as giant lions.
This can be accomplished by creating an "interaction_secretnamehere" raw file with the appropriate [[interaction token]]s.

It is also possible to increase the number of necromancers, and therefore [[Tower_(necromancy)| towers]], by permitting more races to have necromancers. This can be done by adding mortality to races that are not mortal ([[Elf|Elves]] and [[Goblin]]s) with the {{token|MAXAGE}} token, or by adding intelligence to other creature tokens. Even having the ability to pray seems to add yet more original necromancers (that have discovered the secret by worshiping). This could be done by giving religion to races that don't have it, like goblins (see some digging on these subjects here: http://www.bay12forums.com/smf/index.php?topic=161352.0, http://www.bay12forums.com/smf/index.php?topic=154533.0). It also seems that having a DEATH [[Entity_token#RELIGION_SPHERE|sphere]] in the religion of the race vastly increases its chances of discovering the secrets of life and death.

Example: 
Modded goblin race with:
 <nowiki>
	[RELIGION:PANTHEON]
	[RELIGION_SPHERE:DEATH]
