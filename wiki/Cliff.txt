'''Cliffs''' are a [[map tile|terrain]] feature, in which there is a sheer drop along the side of a [[mountain]]. In ''Dwarf Fortress'', this is shown when the edge of one [[z-level]] is not connected to a lower level by a [[ramp]]. This means that dwarves are unable to traverse between the z-levels without [[mining|digging]], [[constructions|constructing]] [[stairs|staircases]], [[climbing]], or [[gravity|falling]].

Cliffs can vary widely in height, but the default world generation settings include an option to ''periodically erode sharp cliffs'', which will limit the amount and height of the cliffs on the map, making almost all of the z-level changes connected by natural ramps.

Cliffs are a welcome spot for dwarven [[suicide]]s, as well as combat accidents. Depending on your *ahem* ''goals'', you might want to keep an eye on them, or even wall them off.
