'''Coral''' is a type of [[material]] composed of the dead remains of corals, creatures that have not yet been implemented into the game. Although coral as a material has been present in ''Dwarf Fortress'' since the very first release, it has never served an in-game purpose, as your dwarves cannot produce it (even though the [[furniture]] and [[finished goods]] [[stockpile]]s include coral within the "Other Materials" listing). Civilizations with {{token|OCEAN_PRODUCTS|e}} (and in proximity to appropriate oceans) have access to this material and can make it into crafts, though dwarves are not capable of making use of this material themselves. 

Thus, very little is known about the material or what its purpose in the game is, though a use might still be implemented in the future. [[Titan]]s, [[forgotten beast]]s, and [[demon]]s are occasionally made of coral, though like all non-fleshy procedurally generated creatures, these only leave ''pieces'' of coral behind when killed, which have no use in the game.

Coral is one of the three unimplemented organic materials in the game, the others being [[amber]] and [[pearl]]s. Dwarves can still have [[preference]]s for the material; more annoyingly, [[noble]]s can still issue [[demand]]s involving these materials.
