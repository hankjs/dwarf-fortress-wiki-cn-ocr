'''Magpie men''' are [[animal people]] variants of the common [[magpie]], who inhabit [[savage]], [[temperate]] flatlands. They spawn in groups of anywhere between 1-5 individuals and are generally content to keep to themselves. In terms of size, they are a little over half the weight of the average [[dwarf]]. All magpie men are born with Legendary [[skill]] in [[Climber|climbing]].

Like other savage animal people, magpie men can join [[civilization]]s, become [[historical figure]]s, appear as [[visitor]]s and be playable in [[adventurer mode]].

Some dwarves [[Preferences|like]] magpie men for their ''intelligence'' and their ''fondness of shiny objects''.
