'''Cave crocodiles''' are massive, subterranean, reptilian predators which can be found in the first two layers of the [[caverns]] - the bane of [[Fisherdwarf|fisherdwarves]] and fledgling fortresses who breach the underground too early. The largest [[creature]]s inhabiting the first cavern level, they'll spawn individually out of the edges of the [[water]] and seek for [[dwarves]] to attack and [[wood]]en [[building]]s to wreck - they are [[building destroyer]]s and will topple [[furniture]] they come across. Cave crocodile hatchlings reach their full size in 2 years, but don't reach adulthood (for breeding purposes) until the end of their 3rd year.

Because of their size (10 times larger than a dwarf) and hostile behavior, cave crocodiles should be engaged with well-equipped [[military]] squads or [[trap]]s. They can also be used as [[mount]]s by [[goblin]]s during [[siege]]s, and they will gleefully swim over any water [[moat]] you are using as a defense - whether their riders survive the trek is another story.

Cave crocodiles can be captured in [[cage]]s rather easily, as furniture for them to topple can be used as bait. They can be [[Animal trainer|trained]] into valuable pets and either [[butcher]]ed for a great amount of returns or kept as livestock. Products made from cave crocodile parts are worth 4 times more than those of common animals. They are the best [[egg]]-layers of all subterranean creatures and one of the best in the entire game, making them the go-to animal for a fortress' [[egg production]]. Because of how prolific they can be and their many uses, a cave crocodile farm can be extremely profitable as it will give you plenty of [[food]], [[bones]] for crafting and a force of giant reptiles to defend your fortress from intruders. Just take measures to ensure [[Catsplosion#Crocsplosion|crocsplosion]] doesn't take down the fortress in the process. 

Some dwarves [[preferences|like]] cave crocodiles for their ''strength''.
