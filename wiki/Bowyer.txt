The '''bowyer''' [[skill]] is used to make [[wood]]en and [[bone]] [[crossbow]]s at a [[bowyer's workshop]].  A dwarf whose highest skill is crossbow-making has the [[profession]] of ''bowyer''.  A higher level of skill produces [[Item quality|higher average quality]] crossbows.

Although crossbows can also be created from metal by a [[weaponsmith]] in a [[forge]], the damage a crossbow deals when fired is determined by the weapon's quality and not their material.  The material only affects damage when dwarves swing their crossbows as impromptu hammers during melee combat.

This skill is not used to make [[bolt]]s, which requires either [[Wood crafter|wood crafting]] for wooden bolts, [[bone carving]] for bone bolts, or [[weaponsmith]]ing for metal bolts. It is also '''not''' used to make [[metal]] crossbows at a [[metalsmith's forge]], which again requires [[weaponsmithing]].

While they can normally only craft crossbows, a bowyer who goes through a [[strange mood]] has a chance to create an [[Legendary artifact|artifact]] [[blowgun]] instead; this is the only way to acquire a blowgun outside of looting dead cavern-dwelling [[animal people]]. Note that strange mood artifacts do not come with ammo included, and therefore these blowguns will not be actually usable in combat.
