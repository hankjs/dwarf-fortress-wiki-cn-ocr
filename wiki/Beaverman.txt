'''Beaver men''' are [[animal people]] variants of the common [[beaver]], who can be found in [[savage]] [[temperate]] [[lake]]s and [[river]]s, spawn in groups of 2-5 individuals, and are generally content to keep to themselves. In terms of size, they are over half the weight of the average [[dwarf]].

Like other savage animal people, beaver men can join [[civilization]]s, become [[historical figure]]s, appear as [[visitor]]s and be playable in [[adventurer mode]].

Some dwarves [[Preferences|like]] beaver men for their ''dams'' and their ''tree-feeding habits''.

<!-- Reference: Angry Beavers -->
Despite popular belief, there are no two beaver siblings with the moniker of "Norbert" and "Daggett". Beaver men also do not live in [[human]]-like houses that double as a living space as well as a dam.

<!-- Reference: Character "Woodie" from the game Don't Starve -->
There is also no known documentation of a [[human]] lumberjack (owning an axe named "Lucy") having a curse of becoming a [[werebeast|werebeaver]] once chopping down enough trees.
