'''Giant pond turtles''' are much larger versions of [[pond turtle]]s your fisherdwarves gather in large quantities. Like their smaller cousins, giant pond turtles possess [[shell]]s, which they can retract into when threatened. 

They can be encountered in [[savage]] [[lake]]s. Giant pond turtles also serve as foreign [[mount]]s during a [[siege]].

Giant pond turtles are a decent source of [[shell]]s and [[meat]].

Some dwarves [[Preferences|like]] giant pond turtles for their ''shells''.
