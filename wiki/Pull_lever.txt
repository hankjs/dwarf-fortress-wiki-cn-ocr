{{D for dwarf}}
The one [[job]] that never gets done right. A [[goblin]] bowmen [[ambush]] has arrived on fast-moving [[elk bird]]s, spotted near your gates by a soon-to-be-dead [[wood cutter]]. You flail momentarily, before grabbing hold of your towel and remembering to not panic; this is what you built a moat for, right? Raise the bridge and all will be well! You set the job order to pull that [[lever]] and save the fortress from certain desecration.

The bowmen continue on their merry way, perpetrating mass slaughter. The bridge does not go up; what could be the problem? You check your unit list again. What's this? The entire fortress decided to go [[party]]ing? Your nearest dwarves are [[on break]]? Your useless lever-pulling [[noble]]s are [[sleep]]ing? The only guy who's willing to pull the level is the crutch-walking wood cutter that nearly died in the last ambush? And he's 50 levels down, fresh from hauling [[ore]] about?

Dwarves are idiots, and will rather party, sleep, drink, haul heavy rocks from place to place, twiddle their thumbs and pick their noses, rather than do the one thing they need to do to save their poor behinds. Dwarf Fortress: conquering dwarven stupidity since 2006.
