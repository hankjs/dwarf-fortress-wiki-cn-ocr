'''Pig tails''' are [[underground]] [[crop]]s that can be [[Herbalist#Gathering_plants|gathered]] in the caverns and [[farming|farmed]] only in summer and autumn. They may be [[brewing|brewed]] into [[Alcohol|dwarven ale]]; [[plant processing|processed]] at a [[farmer's workshop]] to create [[thread|pig tail thread]], which can then be [[dye]]d or used to [[weaving|weave]] pig tail [[cloth]] at a [[loom]]; or mashed into [[slurry]] at a [[quern]] or [[millstone]], which can then be pressed into [[paper]] at a [[screw press]].

Some [[dwarves]] [[Preferences|like]] pig tails for their ''twisting stalks''.
