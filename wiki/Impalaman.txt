'''Impala men''' are [[animal people]] versions of the common [[impala]], found in [[tropical]] [[savanna]] and [[grassland]]s. They spawn in groups of 5-10 individuals and are generally content to keep to themselves. In terms of size, they are the same size as the average [[dwarf]].

Like other savage animal people, they can join [[civilization]]s, become [[historical figure]]s, appear as [[visitor]]s and be playable in [[adventurer mode]]. Impala men are able to wear dwarf-sized armor and clothing, making it a good choice for adventurers of their species to start in a dwarven civilization.

Some dwarves [[Preferences|like]] impala men for their ''mighty leaps''.
