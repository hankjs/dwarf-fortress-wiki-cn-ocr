'''Orthogonal''', or '''orthogonally''', is a technical word used to mean "not diagonally". It's shorthand for "East-West or North-South" or ''(for 2 dimensions)'' "up or down or left or right".

:* The center tile, C, is orthogonal to the four o tiles.<br />
:* Each o tile is orthogonal to the center C tile, plus two x tiles.<br />
:* The x tiles are all orthogonal to two o tiles.<br />
:* No o tiles are orthogonal to each other, nor are any x tiles orthogonal to each other or the C tile.


In the domain of Dwarf Fortress, this concept is crucial in many aspects of [[construction]], fluid [[pressure]], and other areas. Especially in [[tower|above-ground construction]], where a tile not connected orthogonally to something either cannot be built, or will [[collapse]].

These █'s are all connected orthogonally to at least 1 other █. If this was constructed walls or flooring, it would hold up:

   ██████   ███
     ██     █
      ███████


These █'s are ''not'' all connected orthogonally to another █ - some connections are only diagonal. If this was constructed walls or flooring, some parts would [[collapse]], or not be legal to construct:

   ███ ██    ██
     ██     █
       ██████
