'''Giant nautiluses''' are roughly 400 times the size of a common [[vermin]] [[nautilus]], making them slightly larger than an adult [[llama]]. Giant nautiluses are [[aquatic]] creatures; they will rarely interact with land-dwelling dwarves. While they could theoretically appear as [[mount]]s during a [[siege]], no [[ocean]]-inhabiting civilization currently exists to ride them into battle.
:''Some dwarves [[preference|prefer]] giant nautiluses for their shells, or for their many tentacles''.

== Notes ==

According to the raws, nautiluses have 90 tentacles, [[copper]]-based blood, and a [[shell]] (though the tentacles are not yet implemented as part of their body structure).
