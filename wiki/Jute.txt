== In real life ==
Jute is grown almost exclusively in India, Bangladesh, and other countries in South and Southeast Asia, because it is dependent upon monsoon rains as part of its life cycle. However, in the current version of <i>DF</i>, it merely requires [[tropical]] climates.

The fabric most associated with jute is burlap (or hessian), and its tough but rough fibers are frequently used in burlap sacks containing common goods. It is widely used to contain cotton bales, which are used to make clothing.
