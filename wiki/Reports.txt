[[File:reports_preview.png|right]]'''Reports''' are messages detailing either [[combat]] (both practiced and real) between creatures, or events that took place during a [[mission]]. The list goes on for quite a while (up to 11 pages, in fact), but only relatively recent combat or missions will have detailed reports (accessible with {{k|Enter}}) attached, out to a year.

Combat reports are the best renderings of battles, giving detailed information not otherwise revealed by simple characters standing next to or near one another. Since combat involves two (or more) parties, every battle will give at least two reports, one from either side of the fight. Each combat report is a record of the cumulative actions of the creature in question; [[goblin]]s that get [[wound]]ed, run away, then get struck down will not generate more than one report, for instance. Do not confuse reports with [[announcement]]s, which pertain to non-combat events.

In [[adventure mode]], the combat is handled in a slower and more diligent manner, showing the combat report on the upper center area of the screen whenever the player, their companions or anyone nearby is in combat.

== Types of reports ==
New reports generate flags on the side of the screen while unread. All flags/indicators disappear from the main view after you visit the Reports menu by hitting {{k|r}}. The tiles depicted below are those that appear for the report type.

{{Tile|C|4:0:1}}: A [[combat]] report is red, and will be reported on the main menu as "<[[creature]]> is fighting!" Note  that a hunted animal will be considered fighting.<br>
{{Tile|H|2:0:1}}: A [[Ambusher#Hunting|hunting]] report is green, and describes that "the <profession> <name> is hunting."<br>
{{Tile|S|3:0:1}}: A [[sparring]] report is in cyan, and will be indicated as "<dwarf> is sparring."<br>
{{Tile|M|6:0:1}}: A [[mission]] report is in yellow, and will be indicated as "Mission Report: <mission name> (Set out <season> <year>)"<br>
{{Tile|S|6:0:1}}: A [[mission|mission spoils]] report is in yellow, and will be shown as "Spoils Report: <squad>, <season> <year>"<br>
{{Tile|T|6:0:1}}: A new [[tribute]] report is available, and will appear as "Tribute Report: <site government>, <season> <year>" in yellow<br>
{{Tile|I|3:0:1}}: A new Interrogation report is available.  It will appear in the Alerts in cyan.<br>
{{Tile|S|5:0:1}}: A creature performs a unique kind of combat action.

== Contents ==
===Combat===
The contents of combat reports are basically textual battle records, and detailed ones at that &mdash; every battle event is recorded in the report. Sparring and Hunting reports are identical, save for using different font colours.

===Mission===
Mission reports have an animated map on the left side of the screen. A path is traced out from your fortress to the destination and events are "revealed" on the right side of the screen.

===Spoils===
Spoils reports are simple listings of all the objects acquired from a mission.

===Interrogation===
Interrogation reports first state the name and position of the interrogator, followed by the social skill used in interrogating. They will then describe the outcome of the interrogation, including what crimes the subject confessed to, the organisations they are a part of and what plots they are involved in.

=== The History of Dwarven Interrogation===
Hundreds of years ago, it was decided that there was a need for some form of interrogation. The first attempt was using elite [[Hammerdwarf|hammerdwarves]]. Sadly, the <s>victims</s> suspects didn't survive the first blow. The second attempt, the [[screw pump]], almost worked, but any dwarf who survived, looked like an elf because he was stretched so much. The third attempt was being tickled by beard, but the dwarves laughed so much that they could not get any information out of them. The last attempt finally succeeded, by paying someone a lot of money to scream at them until they spilled the <s>beans</s> plump helmets.
