'''Walnut trees''' are one of the many genera of [[tree]]s found above ground. Like the vast majority of above ground trees, walnut [[wood]] is brown and produces brown products.

Walnuts can be gathered from the tree and below it in a fruit gathering [[activity zone]] by any dwarf with the [[herbalist]] profession enabled, then [[cooking|cooked]] into [[Prepared meal|meals]] at a [[kitchen]] or eaten raw.

Some [[Dwarf|dwarves]] [[Preferences|like]] walnut trees for their ''nuts''.
