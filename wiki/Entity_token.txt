'''Entity tokens''' define entities, or [[civilization]]s, in entity_*.txt files.

The <code>[OBJECT:ENTITY]</code> [[token]] begins the definition of an entity [[raw file]]. Each new entity definition that follows begins with the <code>[ENTITY:''entity_ID'']</code> token, where ''entity_ID'' is a unique identifier for that entity, and the entity's properties are then specified by the use of further entity tokens; or, tokens can be added to existing entities using <code>[SELECT_ENTITY:''entity_ID'']</code> instead.

All known entity tokens are listed below.

! Token
! Arguments
! Description

|-
| {{text anchor|ALL_MAIN_POPS_CONTROLLABLE}}
| 
| Allows adventure mode for entities with sites.

|-
| {{text anchor|SITE_CONTROLLABLE}}
| 
| Allows fortress mode. If multiple entities have the SITE_CONTROLLABLE token, then at embark the specific civs can be chosen on the civ list screen. At least one civilization must have this token.

|-
| {{text anchor|CREATURE}}
| creature
|The type of creature that will inhabit the civilization. If multiple creature types are specified, each civilization will randomly choose one of the creatures. In entities with multiple possible creatures, you can manipulate the chance of one creature being chosen by adding multiple identical creature tags. For instance adding [CREATURE:DWARF][CREATURE:DWARF][CREATURE:DWARF][CREATURE:ELF] to the same entity will make the civs created about 75% dwarven, 25% elven. It should be noted that civilizations are in general weighted by this token: for example, if you have one entity with three [CREATURE:DWARF] tokens and another separate entity with a single [CREATURE:ELF] token, then you can expect to see three times as many of the former placed as the latter (assuming enough unclaimed [START_BIOME:X] space remains). Note that spawn rates are also limited by unclaimed biome space - if an entity can only spawn in a rarer set of biomes (only LAKE_TROPICAL_SALTWATER for example) then their spawn rate will end up being limited by the remaining unclaimed space in that biome type rather than the number of [CREATURE:X] tokens present in the entity raw.
|-
| {{text anchor|SOURCE_HFID}}
| integer
| Found on generated [[angel]] entities.  Appears to draw from creatures with this HFID, which associates the entity with a historical figure of the same ID corresponding to a [[deity]].

|}

== Placement ==

Entity spawning during world gen is influenced by several factors:
* The "[[Advanced world generation#Number of Civilizations|Number of Civilizations]]" world gen setting places a hard limit on the total number of entities spawned.
* The "[[Advanced world generation#Playable Civilization Required|Playable Civilization Required]]" world gen setting forces at least one of each [[Entity token#SITE_CONTROLLABLE|SITE_CONTROLLABLE]] entity to spawn (presumably still limited by "Number of Civilizations").
* The number of <nowiki>[</nowiki>[[Entity token#CREATURE|CREATURE]]:X] tokens present in an entity modifies its chance of spawning. An entity containing more <nowiki>[</nowiki>[[Entity token#CREATURE|CREATURE]]:X] tokens will spawn more often (assuming other requirements are met) and may even block entities with fewer <nowiki>[</nowiki>[[Entity token#CREATURE|CREATURE]]:X] tokens from spawning altogether. You can use [SELECT_ENTITY:VANILLA_ENTITY_X] followed by any number of duplicate <nowiki>[</nowiki>[[Entity token#CREATURE|CREATURE]]:VANILLA_CREATURE_X] tokens to attempt to balance the spawn rates of the existing vanilla entities with any custom multi-creature entities you may add.
* The number of unclaimed [[Entity token#START_BIOME|START_BIOME]] or [[Entity token#EXCLUSIVE_START_BIOME|EXCLUSIVE_START_BIOME]] tiles remaining in the world limits the spawn rate for an entity and allows entities to block each other's spawns. If there is no "starting" [[Biome token|biome]] space left for an entity then it will not spawn and the game will try to spawn a different entity instead. This means that, on average, an entity that can start in ALL_MAIN [[Biome token|biomes]] will spawn more frequently than one that can start only in LAKE_TROPICAL_SALTWATER [[Biome token|biomes]]. This also means that entities whose starting [[Biome token|biomes]] do not overlap will not block each other's spawns.

|-
| {{text anchor|BIOME_SUPPORT}}
|
* [[Biome token|biome]]
* frequency
| Controls the expansion of the civilization's territory.  The higher the number is relative to other BIOME_SUPPORT tokens in the entity, the faster it can spread through the biome.  These numbers are evaluated relative to each other, i.e. if one biome is 1 and the other is 2, the spread will be the same as if one was 100 and the other was 200.  Civs can spread out over biomes they cannot actually build in; for example, humans spread quickly over oceans but cannot actually build in them.
[BIOME_SUPPORT:ANY_GRASSLAND:4]

|-
| {{text anchor|SETTLEMENT_BIOME}}
| [[Biome token|biome]]
| If the civ's territory crosses over this biome, it can build settlements here.
[SETTLEMENT_BIOME:ANY_GRASSLAND]

|-
| {{text anchor|START_BIOME}}
| [[Biome token|biome]]
| Combination of EXCLUSIVE_START_BIOME and SETTLEMENT_BIOME; allows the civ to start in and create settlements in the biome. Note that the civ's spawn rate may be limited if all of its START or EXCLUSIVE_START biome(s) are rare in the world or have already been fully occupied by other civ spawns.
[START_BIOME:ANY_FOREST]

|-
| {{text anchor|EXCLUSIVE_START_BIOME}}
| [[Biome token|biome]]
| The birth of the civilization can occur in this biome, but cannot (necessarily) build in it. If the civ does not have SETTLEMENT_BIOME or START_BIOME for the biome in question, it will only construct a single settlement there. Note that the civ's spawn rate may be limited if all of its START or EXCLUSIVE_START biome(s) are rare in the world or have already been fully occupied by other civ spawns.
[EXCLUSIVE_START_BIOME:MOUNTAIN]

|-
| {{text anchor|DEFAULT_SITE_TYPE}}
| site type
| Valid site types are DARK_FORTRESS (π), CAVE (•), CAVE_DETAILED (Ω), TREE_CITY (î), and CITY (#). Also recognizes PLAYER_FORTRESS  (creates a civ of hillocks only), and MONUMENT (creates a civ without visible sites (except tombs and castles), but may cause worldgen crashes). FORTRESS is no longer a valid entry, castles are currently controlled by BUILDS_OUTDOOR_FORTIFICATIONS. Defaults to CITY. Selecting CAVE causes the classic kobold behavior of not showing up on the "neighbors" section of the site selection screen.
Selecting DARK_FORTRESS also allows generation of [[underworld spire|certain other structures]]. It also gives the civ a [[demon|special overlord]]. DARK_FORTRESS may cause crashes during world gen at "Placing civilizations... (0)" if it combined with entity tokens that the vanilla ENTITY:EVIL does not use (likely the POSITION related tokens see [https://www.bay12forums.com/smf/index.php?topic=175747.0 this forum post]).
CAVE_DETAILED civilizations will create fortresses in mountainous regions and hillocks in non-mountainous regions. [DEFAULT_SITE_TYPE:CAVE_DETAILED]

== Population ==

{| {{prettytable}}

! Description

|-
| {{text anchor|MAX_POP_NUMBER}}
| number
| Max historical population '''per entity'''. Multiply this by max starting civ to get the total maximum historical population of the species. Defaults to 500, but all vanilla entities use 10,000, except skulking uses 2,000.
[MAX_POP_NUMBER:10000]

|-
| {{text anchor|MAX_SITE_POP_NUMBER}}
| number 
| Max historical population per individual site. Defaults to 50, but all the vanilla entities use 120.
[MAX_SITE_POP_NUMBER:120]

|-
| {{text anchor|MAX_STARTING_CIV_NUMBER}}
| number
| Max number of civilizations of this entity type to spawn at world generation, which picks entities in some sequential order from the raws, looping through the list as needed. This is a hard limit, if set to 1, only 1 civilization of this type will be placed. If all entities have reached their limit, world generation will not try to place any more, even if its own [[Advanced_world_generation#Number_of_Civilizations|total limit]] has not been reached, and will continue on. Defaults to 3, but all vanilla entities use 100 (essentially unlimited).
[MAX_STARTING_CIV_NUMBER:100]

|-
| {{text anchor|PERMITTED_BUILDING}}
| building name 
| The named, custom building can be built by a civilization in Fortress Mode.
[PERMITTED_BUILDING:SOAP_MAKER]

|-
| {{text anchor|PERMITTED_JOB}}
| [[Unit type token|profession]]
| Allows this job type to be selected. This applies to worldgen creatures, in the embark screen, and in play. Certain professions also influence the availability of materials for trade.
[PERMITTED_JOB:MINER]

|-
| {{text anchor|PERMITTED_REACTION}}
| reaction name 
| Allows this reaction to be used by a civilization. It is used primarily in Fortress Mode, but also allows certain resources, such as [[steel]], to be available to a race. When creating custom reactions, this token '''must''' be present or the player will not be able to use the reaction in Fortress Mode.
[PERMITTED_REACTION:TAN_A_HIDE]

|-
| {{text anchor|CURRENCY_BY_YEAR}}
| 
| Causes the civ's currency to be numbered with the year it was minted.

|-
| {{text anchor|CURRENCY}}
|
* inorganic material
* value
| What kind of metals the civ uses for coin minting, as well as the value of the [[coin]]. Only effective in Adventurer mode due to lack of [[dwarven economy]].

[CURRENCY:SILVER:5]

|-
| {{text anchor|ART_FACET_MODIFIER}}
|
* type
* number
| OWN_RACE, FANCIFUL, EVIL, GOOD
Number goes from 0 to 25600 where 256 is the default.
[ART_FACET_MODIFIER:OWN_RACE:512]

|-
| {{text anchor|ART_IMAGE_ELEMENT_MODIFIER}}
|
* item
* number
| CREATURE, PLANT, TREE, SHAPE, ITEM<br />0-25600

Determines the chance of each image occurring in that entity's artwork, such as engravings and on artifacts, for default (non-historical) artwork.

[ART_IMAGE_ELEMENT_MODIFIER:TREE:512]

|-
| {{text anchor|ITEM_IMPROVEMENT_MODIFIER}}
|
* item
* number
| ART_IMAGE, COVERED or GLAZED, RINGS_HANGING, BANDS, SPIKES, ITEMSPECIFIC, THREAD, CLOTH, SEWN_IMAGE<br />0-25600

Determines the chance of the entity using that particular artwork method, such as "encircled with bands" or "menaces with spikes".

[ITEM_IMPROVEMENT_MODIFIER:SPIKES:0]

This also seems to change the amount that the entity will pay for items that are improved in these ways in their tokens.

|-
| {{text anchor|TRANSLATION}}
| language
| What language raw the entity uses.
* If an entity lacks this tag, translations are drawn randomly from all translation files. Multiple translation tags will only result in the last one being used. Migrants will sometimes arrive with no name.
* If GEN_DIVINE is entered, the entity will use a generated divine language, that is, the same language that is used for the names of [[angel]]s.
* If the entity's main creature has {{token|UTTERANCES|c}}, then this token will be ignored (except when using the naming menu) in favor of procedural [[kobold]]-style [[Kobold language|pseudolanguage]].
[TRANSLATION:DWARF]

|-
| {{text anchor|SELECT_SYMBOL}}
|
* category
* [[language#language_SYM.txt|symbol]]
| ALL, REMAINING, BATTLE, BRIDGE, CIV, CRAFT_GUILD, FESTIVAL (doesn't work, see below), HOSPITAL, LIBRARY, MERCHANT_COMPANY, MILITARY_UNIT, OTHER, RELIGION, ROAD, SIEGE, SITE, TEMPLE, TUNNEL, VESSEL, WALL, WAR
The entity will always use a word from the selected symbol(s) to generate names from that category.
* OTHER applies the symbol selection to personal names and site names. REMAINING will apply the symbol selection to all categories that have not already been declared above it.
* Specific to SELECT_SYMBOL, symbols selected this way will be used as "The X" in "The X of Y" names, and nouns from selected symbols can be used as first [[name]]s.
* FESTIVAL does not work. The game uses symbol NAME_FESTIVAL hardcoded. You may consider changing that symbol (with SELECT_SYMBOL), but then it's applied for all entities.

[SELECT_SYMBOL:ALL:PEACE]

|-
| {{text anchor|SUBSELECT_SYMBOL}}
|
* category
* [[language#language_SYM.txt|symbol]]
| As SELECT_SYMBOL, a word from the subselected symbol(s) will be used in names of that category, in addition to the word from SELECT_SYMBOL (if specified). Used in vanilla to put violent names in sieges and battles.
* Words chosen with SUBSELECT_SYMBOL will appear as either adjectives or "of Y" in "The X of Y" names.
* CULL_SYMBOL does not affect subselected symbols.

[SELECT_SYMBOL:SIEGE:NAME_SIEGE]

[SUBSELECT_SYMBOL:SIEGE:VIOLENT]

|-
| {{text anchor|CULL_SYMBOL}}
|
* category
* [[Language#language_SYM.txt|symbol]]
| Causes the entity to not use the words in these SYM sets.
[CULL_SYMBOL:ALL:UGLY]

|-
| {{text anchor|FRIENDLY_COLOR}}
| see [[color]]
|
The color of this entity's civilization settlements in the world gen and embark screens, also used when announcing arrival of their caravan. Defaults to 7:0:1.

[FRIENDLY_COLOR:1:0:1]

== Religion ==
{| {{prettytable}}
|- bgcolor="#ddd"
! Token
! Arguments
! Description

|-
| {{text anchor|RELIGION}}
| type
|
* REGIONAL_FORCE: The creatures will worship a single force associated with the terrain of their initial biome.
* PANTHEON: The creatures will worship a group of gods, each aligned with their spheres and other appropriate ones as well.

Can be specified multiple times, and will pick randomly from the assigned types. Additional instances of each type will weight the random choice, but unlike {{token|CREATURE|e}}, will not make the entity more likely to spawn.

[RELIGION:PANTHEON]

|-
| {{text anchor|RELIGION_SPHERE}}
| [[Sphere#Available_spheres|sphere]]
| Can be any available [[sphere]] - multiple entries are possible. Choosing a religious sphere will automatically make its opposing sphere not possible for the species to have: adding [[Sphere#WATER|WATER]], for example, means civs of this entity will never get [[Sphere#FIRE|FIRE]] as a religious sphere. Note that the [[Sphere#DEATH|DEATH]] sphere favours the appearance of necromancers (and therefore, towers) "in" the entity.

[RELIGION_SPHERE:FORTRESSES]

|-
| {{text anchor|SPHERE_ALIGNMENT}}
|
* [[Sphere#Available_spheres|sphere]]
* number
|
This token forces an entity to favor or disfavor particular religious spheres. Default is 256, minimum is 0, maximum is 25600.
* Presently, this doesn't cause them to acquire those spheres more often when generating a pantheon.
* [[Sphere#PLANTS|PLANTS]] and [[Sphere#ANIMALS|ANIMALS]] affect the prevalence of depicting {{token|VEGETATION}} and {{token|NATURAL}} creatures, respectively, in a similar fashion to {{token|ART_FACET_MODIFIER|e}}. 
* [[Sphere#WAR|WAR]] modifies the effective [[item value]] of [[weapon]]s and [[armor]] to [[trader]]s of this entity. The multiplier is SPHERE_ALIGNMENT/256, though this only applies to equipment the entity's main creature can properly wield.

[SPHERE_ALIGNMENT:TREES:512]

== Leadership ==
{| {{prettytable}}
|- bgcolor="#ddd"
! Token
! Arguments
! Description

|-
| {{text anchor|POSITION}}
| string
| Defines a leader/noble position for a civilization. These replace previous tags such as [MAYOR] and [CAN_HAVE_SITE_LEADER] and so on. To define a position further, see [[Position token]].

|-
| {{text anchor|SITE_VARIABLE_POSITIONS}}
| Position responsibility or ALL
| Allows a site responsibility to be taken up by a dynamically generated position (lords, hearthpersons, etc.). Any defined positions holding a given responsibility will take precedence over generated positions for that responsibility. Also appears to cause site disputes.{{Verify}} See also: [[variable positions]]

|-
| {{text anchor|VARIABLE_POSITIONS}}
| Position responsibility or ALL
| Allows a responsibility to be taken up by a dynamically generated position (such as Law-maker). Any defined positions holding a given responsibility will take precedence over generated positions for that responsibility. See also: [[variable positions]]

|}

== Behavior ==
{| {{prettytable}}
|- bgcolor="#ddd"
! Token
! Arguments
! Description

|-
| {{text anchor|ETHIC}}
| 
*behavior
*reaction
| Sets the civ's view of [[ethic]]s (certain behaviors), from capital punishment to completely acceptable. This also causes the civ to look upon opposing ethics with disfavor if their reaction to it is opposing, and when at extremes (one ACCEPTABLE, another civ UNTHINKABLE; for example) they will often go to war over it.
[ETHIC:EAT_SAPIENT_KILL:ACCEPTABLE]

|-
| {{text anchor|VALUE}}
| 
*value
*number
| Sets the civ's [[Personality value|cultural values]]. Numbers range from -50 (complete anathema) to 0 (neutral) to 50 (highly valued).
[VALUE:CRAFTSMANSHIP:50]

Certain values must be set to 15 or more for civs to create structures and form entities during history gen:
* 15+ KNOWLEDGE for libraries
* 15+ COOPERATION ''and'' 15+ CRAFTSMANSHIP for craft guilds
** Guilds also need guild-valid professions (see [[#PERMITTED_JOB|PERMITTED_JOB]])

|-
| {{text anchor|VARIABLE_VALUE}}
|
*value or ALL
*min
*max
| Makes values randomized rather than specified.
This tag overrides the VALUE tag. Using [VARIABLE_VALUE:ALL:x:y] and then overwriting single values with further [VARIABLE_VALUE:value:x:y] tags works.

|-
| {{text anchor|WILL_ACCEPT_TRIBUTE}}
| 
| Makes the civ's traders accept offered goods.

|-
| {{text anchor|WANDERER}}, {{text anchor|BEAST_HUNTER}}, {{text anchor|SCOUT}}, {{text anchor|MERCENARY}}
| 
| The civ will send out these sorts of adventurers in worldgen, which seems to increase Tracker skill. These types of adventurers will sometimes be seen leading a battle (instead of war leaders or generals) in remote locations during world-gen, in charge of the defenders.

Mercenaries and monster hunters from the civ may visit player's fortress and petition for residency there to enlist in the military or hunt monsters in caverns, respectively.

|-
| {{text anchor|ABUSE_BODIES}}
| 
| The civilization will mutilate bodies when they are the victors in history-gen warfare, such as hanging bodies from trees, putting them on spikes, and so forth. Adventurers killed in Adventurer mode will sometimes be impaled on spikes wherever they died, with or without this token, and regardless of whether they actually antagonized the townspeople.

|-
| {{text anchor|ACTIVE_SEASON}}
| season
| The season when the civ is most active: when they will trade, interact with you via diplomats, and/or invade you. Civs can have multiple season entries. Note: If multiple caravans arrive at the same time, you are able to select which civ to trade with at the depot menu. ACTIVE_SEASON tags may be changed for a currently active fort.
[ACTIVE_SEASON:AUTUMN]

|-
| {{text anchor|AMBUSHER}}
| 
| When invading, sneaks around and shoots at straggling members of your society. They will spawn on the edge of the map and will only be visible when one of their party are spotted; this can be quite dangerous to undefended trade depots. If the civilization also has the SIEGER token, they will eventually ramp it up to less subtle means of warfare.

|-
| {{text anchor|AT_PEACE_WITH_WILDLIFE}}
|
| Will not attack wildlife, and will not be attacked by them, even if you have them in your party. This can be somewhat disconcerting when attacked by bears in the forest, and your elven ally sits back and does nothing. Additionally, this token determines if the entity can settle in savage biomes.

|-
| {{text anchor|BABYSNATCHER}}
|
| Sends thieves to steal babies. Without this tag (or AMBUSHER, or ITEM_THIEF), enemy civs will only siege (if capable), and will siege as early as they would otherwise babysnatch. This can happen as early as the first year of the fort! In addition, babysnatcher civs will snatch children during worldgen, allowing them to become part of the civ if they do not escape. Also causes this civ to be hostile to any entity without this token.

Note: If the playable civ in fortress mode has this tag (e.g. you add BABYSNATCHER to the dwarf entity) then the roles will be reversed and elves and humans will siege and ambush and goblins will be friendly to you. However, animals traded away to one's own caravan will count as snatched, reported upon the animal leaving the map, and the animal will not count as having been exported.

|-
| {{text anchor|BUILDS_OUTDOOR_FORTIFICATIONS}}
| 
| Makes the civilization build castles from [[mead hall]]s. Only functions when the type of site built is a hamlet/town. This, combined with the correct type of [[position token|position]] associated with a site, is why adventurers can only lay claim to human sites. {{bug|8001}}

|-
| {{text anchor|BUILDS_OUTDOOR_TOMBS}}
| 
| Makes the civilization build tombs.

|-
| {{text anchor|BANDITRY}}
| percentage
| Sets a percentage of the entity population to be used as bandits.

|-
| {{text anchor|DIPLOMAT_BODYGUARDS}}
|
| Visiting diplomats are accompanied by a pair of soldiers.
|-
| {{text anchor|GENERATED}}
|
| Found on generated divine "HF Guardian Entities".  Cannot be used in user-defined raws.

|-
| {{text anchor|INVADERS_IGNORE_NEUTRALS}}
|
| Causes invaders to ignore visiting caravans and other neutral creatures.{{verify}}

|-
| {{text anchor|ITEM_THIEF}}
|
| Sends thieves to steal items. This will also occur in history generation, and thieves will have the "thief" profession. Items stolen in history gen will be scattered around that creature's home. Also causes that civ to be hostile to any entity without this token. Without this tag (or AMBUSHER, or BABYSNATCHER), enemy civs will only siege (if capable), and will siege as early as they would otherwise steal.

Note: If the playable civ in Fortress Mode has this tag (e.g. you add ITEM_THIEF to the Dwarf entity) then the roles will be reversed and elves and humans will siege and ambush and kobolds will be friendly to you. However, ALL items traded away to one's own caravan will count as stolen, reported when the items leave the map, and the stolen items will not count as exported.

|-
| {{text anchor|LOCAL_BANDITRY}}
|
| Causes the entity to send out patrols that can ambush adventurers. Said patrols will be hostile to any adventurers they encounter, regardless of race or nationality.

|-
| {{text anchor|MERCHANT_BODYGUARDS}}
|
| Caravan merchants are accompanied by soldiers.

|-
| {{text anchor|MERCHANT_NOBILITY}}
|
| Merchants will engage in cross-civ trading and form companies.

In previous versions, this resulted in the civ having a Guild Representative / Merchant Baron / Merchant Prince, but now this is controlled solely by positions.

|-
| {{text anchor|PROGRESS_TRIGGER_POPULATION}}
| level
| 0 to 5, civ will come to site once population at site has reached that level. If multiple progress triggers exist for a civ, it will come when any one of them is fulfilled instead of waiting for all of them to be reached. A value of 0 disables the trigger. 1 corresponds to 20 dwarves, 2 to 50 dwarves, 3 to 80, 4 to 110, and 5 to 140. Progress triggers may be changed, added, or deleted for a currently active fort. Note: hostile civs require that this be fulfilled as well as at least one other non-siege trigger before visiting for non-siege activities.

|-
| {{text anchor|PROGRESS_TRIGGER_PRODUCTION}}
| level
| 0 to 5, civ will come to site once created wealth has reached that level. If multiple progress triggers exist for a civ, it will come when any one of them is fulfilled instead of waiting for all of them to be reached. A value of 0 disables the trigger. 1 corresponds to 5000☼ created wealth, 2 to 25000☼, 3 to 100000☼, 4 to 200000☼, and 5 to 300000☼. Progress triggers may be changed, added, or deleted for a currently active fort.

|-
| {{text anchor|PROGRESS_TRIGGER_TRADE}}
| level
| 0 to 5, civ will come to site once exported goods has reached that level. If multiple progress triggers exist for a civ, it will come when any one of them is fulfilled instead of waiting for all of them to be reached. A value of 0 disables the trigger. 1 corresponds to 500☼ exported wealth, 2 to 2500☼, 3 to 10000☼, 4 to 20000☼, and 5 to 30000☼. Progress triggers may be changed, added, or deleted for a currently active fort.

|-
| {{text anchor|PROGRESS_TRIGGER_POP_SIEGE}}
| level
| 0 to 5, civ will begin to send sieges against the player civ when this level is reached if it is hostile.

If multiple progress triggers exist for a civ, it will come when any one of them is fulfilled instead of waiting for all of them to be reached. A value of 0 disables the trigger.

|-
| {{text anchor|PROGRESS_TRIGGER_PROD_SIEGE}}
| level
| 0 to 5, civ will begin to send sieges against the player civ when this level is reached if it is hostile.

|-
| {{text anchor|PROGRESS_TRIGGER_TRADE_SIEGE}}
| level
| 0 to 5, civ will begin to send sieges against the player civ when this level is reached if it is hostile.

|-
| {{text anchor|SIEGER}}
|
| Will start campfires and wait around at the edge of your map for a month or two before rushing in to attack. This will occur when the progress triggers for sieging are reached. If the civ lacks smaller methods of conflict (AMBUSHER, BABYSNATCHER, ITEM_THIEF), they will instead send smaller-scale sieges when their triggers for "first contact" are reached.

|-
| {{text anchor|SIEGE_SKILLED_MINERS}}{{v|53.01}}
|
| Improves the skill of [[miner]] invaders by a factor of 5. Used for [[dwarves]] in vanilla.

|-
| {{text anchor|SITE_GUARDIAN}}
|
| Guards certain special sites, such as a [[vault]] belonging to a [[demon]] allied with a [[deity]].  Used in generated divine entities. 

|-
| {{text anchor|SKULKING}}
|
| This makes the severity of attacks depend on the extent of item/baby thievery rather than the passage of time. Designed to go with ITEM_THIEF, may or may not work with BABYSNATCHER.  Prevents the civ from engaging in diplomacy or ending up at war.

|-
| {{text anchor|TREE_CAP_DIPLOMACY}}
|
| Visiting diplomats impose tree cutting quotas; without this, they will simply compliment your fortress and leave. Also causes the diplomat to make unannounced first contact at the very beginning of the first spring after your fortress becomes a land holder.

|-
| {{text anchor|LAYER_LINKED}}
| 
| Defines if a civilization is a hidden subterranean entity, such as [[bat man]] civilizations. May spawn in any of the three caverns; cavern dweller raids due to [[agitation]] will pull from these. If you embark as this civ, you have access to pets and trees from all three layers, not only the first.

|-
| {{text anchor|MINING_UNDERWORLD_DISASTERS}}
|
| The civilization can breach the [[Underworld]] during world generation, spawning a civilization of {{token|EVIL}} creatures lead by a unique [[demon]].

|-

If certain armor types are lacking after performing one pass of randomised checks, the game will repeat random checks until an option is successfully chosen.
[ARMOR:ITEM_ARMOR_PLATEMAIL:COMMON]

|-
| {{text anchor|DIGGER}}
| item token
| Causes the selected weapon to fall under the "digging tools" section of the embark screen. Also forces the weapon to be made out of metal, which can cause issues if a modded entity has access to picks without access to metal - for those cases, listing the pick under the [WEAPON] token works just as well. Note that this tag is neither necessary nor sufficient to allow use of that item as a mining tool – for that, the item itself needs to be a weapon with {{token|SKILL|wp|MINING}}.

|-
| {{text anchor|INDOOR_FARMING}}
|
| Allow use of underground plant products in the goods available for trade. Lack of suitable vegetation in the caverns will cause [[World generation#Rejections|worldgen rejection]]s. According to Droseran: "Gives access to plants (structural material) and seeds. It only checks for {{token|EDIBLE_RAW|md}} or {{token|EDIBLE_COOKED|md}} on the plant's structural material. It doesn't check if the plant can be used in a reaction to produce something edible, only if it can be eaten raw or cooked. If an entity with this token is placed in a biome that doesn't have at least one of these tokens on the structural material, the map is rejected. Due to the randomness of plant selection in biomes, this can happen a lot as only about half of the vanilla plants have edible structural materials. Removing either of these tokens from plants dramatically increases map rejections."
