'''Kakapo''' are small, flightless [[Creature|parrots]] who appear in a number of [[temperate]] biomes. A lone kakapo may occasionally appear in the map and do little else but meander around adorably – they are [[kea]], except without all the bad parts. In [[adventure mode]], male kakapo are one of the few creatures in the game who emit [[noise]]s, with the game describing their booms and chings as the player approaches them.

Kakapo can be captured with [[cage]] [[trap]]s and [[Animal trainer|trained]] into low-value [[pet]]s. They can be used to [[Egg production|produce]] a meager quantity of [[egg]]s, which is likely the most suitable use for them, as [[Butcher|tearing the adorable thing apart]] only provides enough [[meat]] to fill up six dwarves for a season. Still, you may be tempted to send a [[military|militia-dwarf]] to hunt wild kakapo before they leave, since they are too slow to run away. Kakapo are among the longest-living animals in the game, some living up to 120 years, which makes them actually quite long-lasting companions to dwarves who adopt them.

Some dwarves [[Preferences|like]] kakapo for their ''longevity'', their ''flightlessness'' and their ''booming calls''.
