'''Blue peafowl''' are [[goose]]-sized [[Domestic animal|domestic]] [[Creature|birds]] found in [[tropical]] broadleaf [[forest]]s. The males (''peacocks'') have bright blue plumage and tail feathers that make large, "eyed" fans. Females (''peahens'') have brown plumage, and lay [[egg]]s in a [[nest box]]. If a peacock is present and the eggs are not [[food hauling|collected]], they may eventually hatch into ''peachicks''. Peachicks grow into adults 1 year after hatching.

Peafowl can be used as the basis for a poultry industry. They can often be purchased at [[embark]] or from [[trader]]s. Peafowl, [[duck]]s, [[goose|geese]], and [[turkey]]s are the only common domestic egg-laying animals that can be found in wild populations, and, if your fortress includes the proper [[biome]], can be gathered with [[cage trap]]s and [[animal trainer|tamed]], instead of purchased from traders or at embark.

[[Domestic_animal#Comparison of domestic poultry|On average]], peahens lay slightly fewer eggs than [[chicken|chicken hens]], but are more consistent (and therefore predictable), laying between 6 and 8 eggs per clutch. Additionally, peafowl produce more [[meat]], [[fat]], and [[bone]]s than chickens when butchered as part of a [[meat industry]]. However, [[turkey]]s lay more eggs and produce more meat, fat, and bones than peafowl, although turkeys take twice as long to grow to full size. Peafowl are also the longest-lived of all the domestic birds; this can make them perfect for alternate uses of a domestic animal, such as sealing them in "[[defense_guide#Animals|lookout towers]]".  Since they don't eat or drink, and can stay pastured in a 1×1 area staring through a window and/or fortification for up to 15 years in a row, they make useful watch-birds in preventing goblin ambushes from sneaking through unmolested.

Some [[Dwarf|dwarves]] [[Preferences|like]] blue peafowls for their ''coloration'' and their ''enormous fan tails''.

{{D for Dwarf}}

All of the qualities of the blue peafowl suggest it would be an excellent choice for [[egg production]] and the [[meat industry]]. However, there is one small problem. At night, blue peafowl enjoy roosting in [[tree]]s. This Elfish conduct is unbecoming for any creature owned by dwarves (although, there are some that feel that eating "tree roosters" sends the right message to the <s>tree-fondling hippies</s> Elves).
