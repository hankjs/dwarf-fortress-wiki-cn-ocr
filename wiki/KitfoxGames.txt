'''Kitfox Games''' is a game studio focused on simulation games and roguelikes. Kitfox Games has developed several first-party titles, and serves as publisher for several indie games, including ''[[Dwarf Fortress]]''.

== Involvement with Dwarf Fortress ==

[[Bay 12 Games]] posted on April 2019 that they partnered with Kitfox, after a medical scare that made them worry about their long-term finances. Kitfox hired artists to work on the [[graphics set]] and [[soundtrack]] for the [[Premium]] release.<sup><nowiki>[</nowiki>[https://www.patreon.com/posts/25343688 source]]</sup>

In December 2022, Kitfox published ''Dwarf Fortress'' commercially to [https://kitfoxgames.itch.io/dwarf-fortress Itch.io] and [https://store.steampowered.com/app/975370/Dwarf_Fortress/ Steam].
