[[File:freezing_preview.png|thumb|300px|right|"We all need to huddle"-type weather.]][[Water]] in ''Dwarf Fortress'' can '''freeze''' to become [[ice]] if the temperature is low enough and the water is exposed to the air. The tile must be tagged as 'Above Ground' in order for the temperature to get low enough, as all 'Subterranean' tiles remain at a consistent [[temperature]] of {{ct|10015}}. However, inside glaciers even 'Subterranean' tiles appear to be cold enough to freeze water.

Water at levels 1/7 to 3/7 freeze to become an ice floor. Water at level 4/7 or greater freezes to become an ice wall. Any ice wall will produce 7/7 water when melted, or can be mined for 1 boulder of ice.

This may be useful if embarking on a location with limited water and seasonal freezing, as if collecting the spring melt-water.  One could expand a lake to 175% its original size (if 7/7 full) so it levels to 4/7, let it freeze then thaw, then drain the expansion to a deeper cistern. If the water in the original lake is preserved at 7/7, the process may be repeated each year.

=== Creature effects ===
Creatures on a water tile that freezes into an ice wall are instantly killed. Dwarves die with the message "<dwarf name> has been encased in ice". The ice wall must be melted or mined in order to regain the items/corpses.

=== Building effects ===
Constructing in or on a tile that freezes has mostly no problems (see below), floors placed on or in ice will stay there through melts and freezes.

Floor hatches will disassemble if covered by an ice wall. The hatches and any associated mechanisms survive the process, but will wash away once the ice melts.

Floor grates placed on water that freezes will be "uninstalled" come spring.

=== Melting ===
Ice can melt when the temperature rises as part of the natural cycle of seasons. Some biomes may be frozen all year round and others may never freeze. Ice can also be melted by proximity to [[magma]]. An ice tile with magma moving above or beneath it, or within 2 tiles on the same z-level, may cause the ice to melt (or will prevent water freezing in the first place); see [[Magma#Properties_of_magma|properties of magma]].

== Climate ==
Freezing [[climate]]s are the coldest, and water on them is typically in permafrost. Choosing to embark in one poses an interesting challenge and offers opportunities for substantial amounts of [[losing|fun]].

=== Settling ===
One of the first challenges presented by a freezing climate is the lack of [[water]] in any conveniently drinkable form. Along with trees, water may be the hardest resource to obtain. The ice chunks left behind while digging through ice cannot be melted into drinking water. There are several ways to approach a freezing area. One of them  is to penetrate to the cavern levels, which may have water in liquid form. Another is embarking with a [[volcano]] in site, utilizing the natural obsidian surrounding it to create [[magma-safe]] floodgates and mechanisms to effectively melt ice. Although [[ice]] may be melted by [[magma]] or other heat sources, it can be used to create buildings, workshops, and constructions that will never melt. Underground water will not freeze, but a well using it must never have been exposed to the sky; simply building a roof over it will not suffice.

Remember that staying outside too long can cause your livestock and dwarves to die from exposure if the temperature is low enough{{verify|can it? and how cold?}}, and clothes and armor do '''not''' protect them from it.

=== Cautions ===
While channeling ice and magma, supervise your miners to ensure they are not encased in cooling magma or freezing ice.
