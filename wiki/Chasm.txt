:''This article is about the biome. You might be looking for a certain bottomless feature found [[Hell|here]] (spoilers!).

Bottomless '''chasms''' as a geographical feature do not exist. However, chasms exist as the SUBTERRANEAN_CHASM [[biome]] token in the [[raw file|raws]]. This tag seems to imply the spawning of creatures in non-water parts of the [[cavern]]s, as opposed to the SUBTERRANEAN_WATER biome.

Bottomless chasm '''tiles''' can be placed in the Arena mode layout (arena.txt) using the character "C".  When something falls into one of these tiles, the tile has an animation of {{DFtext|■∙·|7:1}} (note that in-game with the default tileset, the first dot will appear larger).  Open space above a chasm will always use the {{DFtext|▓|3:0:0}} tile, never a {{DFtext|∙}} tile.
