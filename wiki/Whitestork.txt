'''White storks''' are a species of [[Creature|bird]] who can be found in [[grassland]]s and [[wetland]]s, where they spawn in groups of 5-10 individuals. They are benign and around half the size of a [[cat]], doing nothing but fly across the area aimlessly, posing no threat to the average [[dwarf]].

White storks can be captured in [[cage]] [[trap]]s and [[Animal trainer|trained]] into cheap exotic [[pet]]s. They produce a small amount of returns when [[butcher]]ed and lay a meager amount of [[egg]]s if placed in a [[nest box]], being only really useful as livestock if no domestic birds are available.

Some dwarves [[Preferences|like]] white storks for their ''long necks'', their ''long legs'' and their ''long bills''.

Despite popular belief, white storks don't actually bring [[Children|babies]] to your fortress.
