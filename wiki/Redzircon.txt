'''Red zircons''' are semi-valuable [[gem]]s that can be found in both [[igneous]] and [[metamorphic]] stone layers. They are equal in [[material value|value]] to all other colored zircons; [[clear zircon]], however, is more valuable.

Red zircon can be used in substitute with the same-colored, more expensive [[ruby]].
