{{creaturedesc}}
'''Giant octopuses''' inherit the abilities of [[octopus]]es, including their ability to squirt ink.

Giant octopuses can act as a replacement shark in moats. They have the advantage of having multiple arms, and are therefore less likely to be hit in a vital area.

{{D for Dwarf}}
Recipe for moat: 1 or more [[octopus]]/[[shark]]/[[crocodile]]/[[alligator]] added into a bowl (moat). Fill with water (7/7 for optimal conditions). Add goblins or another topping (victim) of your choice and whisk (mutilate).

==In real life==
This sea monster is also known as the [[Wikipedia:kraken|kraken]]. It regularly attacks ships (possibly one reason why dwarves never build ships). In some legends, sailors evade this terrifying monster by digging deep underground to an island rather than face the perils of the sea.
