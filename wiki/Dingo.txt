'''Dingoes''' are [[Creature|animals]] found in non-freezing [[biome]]s, uncommonly appearing in packs of 3-12 individuals. Meandering predators, slightly smaller than a common [[dog]], they may attack your livestock, as well as your [[Dwarf|dwarves]], but are unlikely to kill civilians unless they're alone. They are considerably more common in [[adventurer mode]], however, acting as a more numerous and annoying version of [[Wolf|wolves]]. They possess thick fur which provides them with increased insulation compared to most other animals, and their newborns are referred to as ''pups''.

Dingoes can be captured in [[cage]] [[trap]]s and [[Animal trainer|trained]] into exotic [[pet]]s. They give equivalent returns to dogs when [[butcher]]ed, and products made from their parts are worth [[Multiply value|twice]] more than those made with more common animal parts.

Some dwarves [[Preferences|like]] dingoes for their ''coloration''.

{{D for Dwarf}}
It should be noted that Dingoes are known for their tendencies to steal dwarven children, especially babies. Their notoriety for baby snatching is second only to that of the [[Thief|Goblin Snatcher]].

It is rumored by some dwarves that after successfully stealing a child, the dingo will raise them as its own children, and when they grow adolescent - you get a [[Dingo man]].

The wildly popular Dwarf "Jurist Olivine" has, in his book series Next Week Right Now, popularized the notion that you should never call a Dingo to look after your baby. The Dingo has big conflicts of interests.

Dingoes have also been said to run studios creating low-quality audiovisual entertainment.
