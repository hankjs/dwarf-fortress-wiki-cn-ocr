'''Stoat men''' are humanoid versions of the common [[stoat]] and a [[Creature|species]] of unremarkable [[animal people]], found in [[savage]] [[taiga]]s and [[tundra]]s. They are a little over half the size of [[dwarf|dwarves]] when adults and spawn in groups of 1-5 individuals. They should pose no threat unless provoked.

Like other savage animal people, stoat men may occasionally join [[civilization]]s, becoming full-fledged citizens who may appear in your fortress as [[visitor]]s or be playable in [[adventurer mode]].

Some dwarves [[Preferences|like]] stoat men for their ''ability to take down large prey''.

{{D for Dwarf}}
Known to prey on unassuming [[hare man|hare men]] with mind control techniques, robbing them of their boots.
