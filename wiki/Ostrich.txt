'''Ostriches''' are flightless [[Creature|birds]] who inhabit [[desert]]s, [[tropical]] [[savanna]]s and tropical [[grassland]]s, appearing in groups of anywhere between 1-10 individuals. They are a half again as large as the average [[dwarf]] but are completely benign, doing little but meandering the area cluelessly. The sprite for ostriches will have black feathers for males, and greyish-brown feathers for females. They will normally flee when attacked, but if enraged they may attempt to defend themselves, preferably with kick attacks. Male ostriches are called ''ostrich cocks'', while females are called ''ostrich hens''.

Ostriches can be captured in [[cage]] [[trap]]s and [[Animal trainer|trained]] into [[pet]]s. They produce a good quantity of products when [[butcher]]ed and lay a fairly high amount of [[egg]]s if placed in a [[nest box]]; these traits combine to make them good choices to serve as the basis for [[egg production]] and a [[meat industry]]. Among the large ratite birds in the game (ostriches, [[emu]]s and [[Cassowary|cassowaries]]), ostriches are by far the largest, though they may not live as long as a cassowary. Ostriches appear to be the smallest creature to yield either [[feather]]s or [[gizzard stone]]s when butchered.

Some dwarves [[Preferences|like]] ostriches for their ''long necks'' and their ''giant eggs''.
