[[File:werebeast_sprite_preview.png|right]]'''Werebeasts''' {{Tile|Ñ|6:0}} are [[night creature]]s resembling an unnatural cross between a sapient creature and a beast, [[cursed]] to transform every full moon into a dangerous and bloodthirsty beast form. The curse can be contracted by incurring the wrath of one's patron [[deity]] or from another werebeast. Werebeasts are hated and feared throughout much of the world, posing a great risk to the player.

There will be a specific amount of werebeasts roaming the lands, depending on [[Advanced world generation#Number_of_Werebeast_Curse_Types| the world's settings]]. They can take the form of mammals or reptiles, ranging from the classic [[Wolf|werewolf]], to more exotic things like [[Giraffe|weregiraffes]], [[Lizard|werelizards]], [[Sloth|weresloths]] or [[Gila monster|weregila monsters]]. Also included are some creatures not normally present in the game (werelorises, weremammoths).

The behaviour of vanilla werebeasts in worldgen (i.e. fleeing town upon being cursed, and conducting raids from their new lair) appears to be caused by the cursed individual's beast form having the {{token|NIGHT_CREATURE_HUNTER}} tag; removal of this tag from a generated werebeast extracted from a world.dat file and jimmied into the standard raws caused those cursed to behave no differently from any other unnaturally-[[Immortality|immortal]] individual.

The sprite assigned to a werebeast will be closest to its randomly, procedurally generated appearance. There are 72 possible sprites.

== Characteristics ==
[[File:weregoat_story.jpg|thumb|350px|"My Captain of the guard, just released from the hospital, transformed into a weregoat while sparring with his soldiers just to instantly get an arm cut off and the head smashed in."<br><small>''Art by Devilingo''</small>]]
A number of different types of werebeast curses are procedurally generated during world generation. Their numbers are normally dependent on world size, but can be directly controlled with [[advanced world generation]] - if you prefer not having werebeasts (and therefore not having [[fun]]), generating a world with "{{tt|Number of Werebeast Curse Types}}" set to {{tt|0}} in advanced world generation will ensure that no werebeasts exist in your world. 

There are more kinds of mammal curses (64 possible, though it might leave off some amphibious/bat ones), so it reduces the chances of each specific one to avoid a mammal flood.  The generic lizard is given more weight, since it's more vague and presumably encompasses more things. 

While procedurally generated, all werebeasts possess certain characteristics in common. They are all [[fanciful]], evil-aligned humanoids taking the shape of an animal who is crazed for blood and flesh, with glowing eyes and a brief description of their skin ("Its charcoal scales are blocky and close-set."), who are associated with the [[sphere]]s of animals, chaos, moon and night. While intelligent, werebeasts are locked in a [[berserk]] state and will behave accordingly, attacking anything in view.

During werebeast transformations, which occur at [[Werebeast#Transformation_dates|full moons]], the beast will not transform back into its original form until the duration of the full moon has ended.  The transformations, whether from dwarf-to-beast or beast-to-dwarf, will fully restore the unit in question to complete health. Hunger and thirst will both be removed, and injuries (including missing limbs) will be fully healed. Effects induced by insanity are not reversed, however, so berserking soldiers that transform will still not follow orders. 

=== Curse transmission and effects ===
Sapient creatures ([[human]]s, [[Dwarf|dwarves]], [[Elf|elves]], [[goblin]]s or [[animal people]]) bitten by werebeasts are cursed to become werebeasts themselves.{{cite forum|126618}} Those that have died as a werebeast are still capable of being resurrected by necromancers as intelligent undead. When this happens, the curse is retained and the newly revived will proceed to transform on a monthly basis whenever the original bite/turn date is reached. Transformations will not remove their status as undead.

The size of the werebeast is dependent on the nature of its curse; wererhinos and weremammoths are particularly massive, while those based on smaller creatures can have a random size at least 1/3 larger than a dwarf. Depending on their starting status and the beast form in question, transformed individuals may receive augmented (or reduced!) strength, agility, recuperation and disease resistance while in monster form, though they often possess slightly lower-than-average toughness and endurance. All werebeasts possess at least Talented [[skill]] in [[wrestling]], [[Combat skill|biting, fighting, striking, kicking, dodging]] and [[Observer|observing]], as well as Legendary skill in [[ambusher]]. If the werebeast is a child, these skills will be at "dabbling" level. Additionally, they can [[Amphibious|breathe underwater]], [[No Exert|feel no exertion]], [[No Stun|cannot be stunned]] and are [[No Pain|immune to pain]], nausea, dizziness and fevers. Werebeasts need no food, water or sleep to survive, nor do they need to breathe, meaning they cannot be drowned or strangled. Werebeasts are Level 2 [[building destroyer]]s and all but the smallest are completely [[Trapavoid|immune to traps]] while transformed, safely bypassing any sort of [[trap]] set in their way. They may be caged when they revert, however.

=== Combat, strengths and weaknesses ===
If the werebeast cannot use weapons in its beast form (i.e. no hands), only the natural abilities of the creature are available for combat, which differ from creature to creature (claws/hooves/venomous bite etc.), but only their bites cause the werebeast curse to be transmitted. Werebeasts have been confirmed to have the ability to arrive at your fortress both armed and using stealth. Some werebeasts possess [[Syndrome|venom]] as well, applying "[[Syndrome|night sickness]]" to those who are bitten along with the werebeast curse. 

All werebeasts possess a built-in damage resistance against most weapon-grade [[metal]]s which halves the damage taken during combat, save for one randomly chosen metal which the werebeast will instead be 10 times weaker against. Unlike in the werewolf myth, this weakness isn't restricted to [[silver]], though a werebeast race may indeed be weak to it. There are no means in [[fortress mode]] to learn which metal a given werebeast is weak against during gameplay. In [[adventurer mode]] this information is included in the quest rumor, but an afflicted adventurer can only learn their own weakness [[Wound|the fun way]].

Dwarves will never have [[preferences]] for werebeasts, as they possess no {{token|PREFSTRING}}. They possess an unused [[Pet#Pet value|pet value]] of 2,000.

Killed werebeasts are always listed in a unit's or weapon's kill log as a member of their original race, even if the werebeast was dispatched while in animal form.

===Werebeast types===
Here follows a conclusive list of all possible shapes given to a cursed individual. Note that descriptors/colors are randomized upon the curses' generation, so you may encounter "different" werebeasts of the same species in the same world. These descriptors, however, are purely for flavour, and have no gameplay implications.

==Werebeasts in fortresses==
In some regions, the full moon will herald the attack of werebeasts upon your fortress and the unwilling transformation of your own citizens into their bestial forms. This can only happen after a certain amount of time has passed, which can be adjusted in the [[Difficulty#Werebeasts|difficulty]] [[settings]], or can be [[Difficulty#Individual_enemy_toggles|completely disabled]].

If the region has at least one type of werebeast, a werebeast may choose to [[ambush]] your fortress from the surface, revealing itself only once seen. Unlike most other invaders, werebeasts are only announced on their discovery (triggering a message similar to that of a [[megabeast|megabeast]]), allowing them to get much closer to your fortress than most other threats. Local werebeasts will be announced at the moment of their transformation, but unlike invaders will not pause the game and can therefore slip under the radar if the transformation was unexpected or there was numerous other announcements at the time.

Transformed werebeasts are building destroyers, pathing to and toppling workshops and furniture that may be accessible to them. They will attack anything they can find for the duration of the full moon - including wildlife, livestock, and the dwarves of your fortress, prioritizing creatures over buildings in their efforts to spread the affliction. 

Werebeasts of the same beast-species are not hostile to each other while transformed. Generally, a werebeast will not attack another werebeast of the same species when it initially transforms. There have been reports of them attacking each other, so be careful if you want to keep them alive.

Because werebeasts are ambushers (only announcing themselves when found) and are only active for a few days of the month, it's possible for their 'visits' to go completely undetected by members of your fort (though the local wildlife may certainly have noticed). If a werebeast is only spotted after the full moon has ended and it has reverted back to its normal form, the game will still announce its discovery, but instead in its ''current'' form (leading to amusing/terrifying messages such as "The Human (name) has come! A medium-sized creature prone to great ambition.").

Occasionally, a werebeast can infiltrate your fortress, as they've visited as part of a passing caravan. They'll only turn upon the changing of the moon phase, and you will not get the warning given when they'd normally appear on the map.

==Defending your fort against werebeasts==
If you have not established an early-detection defensive perimeter (see [[defense guide]] and note that most werebeast forms are [[trapavoid]]), it is quite likely that if a werebeast attacks, a dwarf will be bitten. The best defense against this is to keep civilians off the surface (unless they are inside high walls), and rely on warning systems to tell you when to trigger a [[Burrow#Civilian_Alerts|civilian alert]] and close your [[bridge|drawbridges]]. A werebeast retains its infectious form for only a few days during the full moon. After that, it reverts to an ordinary humanoid form, and will typically flee.

Warning systems may include [[pasture]]d or [[restraint|restrained]] animals, or outdoor [[statue]]s. If you get notices of toppled statues with no visible cause, it's probable there is a werebeast nearby. Baby werecreatures are neutral, and while you can order your military to kill them, the order will not be followed.

===Infection===
[[File:Weregiraffe.jpg|thumb|A Weregiraffe infecting dwarves. Note that getting infected doesn't protect the dwarf in question from further attacks.<br />''Art by [[Zach Adams]]''.]]
Werebeasts are dangerous opponents, perfectly capable of killing an unarmed dwarf with impunity, but as notification-worthy invaders go they aren't especially terrifying; a few dwarves with modest military training and gear should be able to handle them with few casualties, as will a single elite dwarf in quality steel gear. The real threat they pose, however, is in their bite. If a sentient creature is bitten by a werebeast, and the bite tears fat, skin, or muscle, said creature becomes infected. Infected creatures will become werebeasts at the next full moon (see below for schedule). Scratches, bites that merely bruise or dent, and subsequent shaking attacks after a bite will not transmit the curse, and thus are merely as dangerous as any other such assault. Any [[learning]] creature who has [[blood]] and isn't [[undead]] or supernatural can potentially be infected, meaning you could theoretically have things such as [[troglodyte]] or [[troll]] werebeasts, while animals, [[vampire]]s, and [[Mummy|mummies]] are immune to it.

There is no cure. To protect your other dwarves, you should either keep all infected dwarves isolated so they cannot infect your whole fortress, or if you do not want to take care of them, [[expel]] them from the fortress or just kill them.

Only the original werebeast of a particular strain is immune to aging. All subsequent creatures who become infected from that strain will still retain their original lifespans (in the case of elves and goblins, they simply continue to be immortal). While transformed, a werebeast will require neither food nor drink, nor do they require sleep. Note that the immunity to these requirements only applies during the full moon. However, the monthly transformation resets an infected creature's dehydration and hunger levels, thus allowing them to be trapped in a room until they expire from old age (although they will likely go mad well before this happens). Additionally, each transformation will heal any and all of an infected creature's wounds, and will also restore any missing limbs which the creature may have had.

Particularly [[Fun]] ideas for using werecreatures include:

===Infecting your entire fort===
It is possible for everyone in the fort to become infected; having only infected dwarves does not end your game.

'''Pros:'''
* Super-effective hospital service; your dwarves are fully healed once per month. No need for crutches or anything.
* No need for food or drink, though you can keep alcohol around for happy thoughts and to avoid alcohol withdrawal
* No need for beds or bedrooms, other than those for nobles
* When transformed, civilian dwarves are less vulnerable
* Dwarves will happily discard their old tattered clothing and pick up fresh clothes every month.
* Unhappy thoughts are less severe, as the process of being bitten and biting others tends to make your dwarves very resilient to tragedy.
* Go for were-elephants or were-badgers for extra dwarven points
* Fun
'''Cons:'''
* Exceedingly difficult to set up, quite time-consuming as well; may kill your most important dwarves
* When transformed, fortress activity grinds to a halt, and for a few days afterwards, as civilians run around finding new clothing
* Werebeasts are building destroyers, so you'll constantly need to remake workshops and most furniture
* Trading is especially difficult
* Will cause issues with military when transformed: transformation removes all armor, though they will hold onto their weapons, shields, and even quivers/bolts during transformation.
* May be exceedingly ‼fun‼ for [[Thought|dwarven]] [[Tantrum|sanity]]... but then again, you ''were'' looking for fun in the first place

There are several ways to attempt to infect your whole fort, some with higher success rates than others. The trick is to have your uncursed dwarves be bitten but not die, and also to have your cursed dwarves survive any retribution. Delaying the release of the werebeast until near the end of the full moon will reduce the chances of the situation spiralling out of control (though it will also reduce the rate of infection).

The following are some commonly used methods to achieve this; in an approximately decreasing order of risk to your fortress population, but increasing effort to implement.

==== Squad assignment method ====
One method is to equip a squad of dwarves with training weapons and send them to an isolated area with one or two of your werebeasts. Ideally the dwarves who get [[Wound|injured]] will back away while the others hold back the werebeast. In reality it can be hard to balance the battle, which leads to either the werebeast killing off the injured dwarves, or being pummeled into submission without spreading their curse. Another significant problem arises when an attack by either the werebeast or a dwarf happens at the moment of transformation. This is considered a dwarf-on-dwarf attack, which leads to a minor [[loyalty cascade]].

==== Confinement method ====
Another method is to simply lock a werebeast in a room with civilian(s) and hope that the civilian survives long enough for the werebeast to turn back. This reduces (but does not eliminate) the chance of a loyalty cascade, because only the werebeast is attacking. The increasing risk with this method, is that werebeasts become legendary fighters/wrestlers very quickly, at which point they are capable of mortally wounding, or outright killing, half a dozen dwarves in a single transformation.

==== Cage trap method ====
[[Image:Creature_wereracoon_cage-trap_v50.png|thumb|right|Wereraccoon accidentally caught in cage trap. A safer outcome than most [[‼SCIENCE‼]] failures.]]

The most successful method discovered is to lock a werebeast in a room with civilians, but make sure the room is completely covered in [[cage trap]]s (Though this method may not work with certain types of werebeasts, such as wereraccoons, as they may be small enough to be caught in cage traps when transformed). Many injuries inflicted by werebeasts can knock a dwarf [[unconscious]] due to pain or strangulation, and an unconscious dwarf will be trapped by a cage trap. In the cage, dwarves are free to recover from their wounds, safe from any further attacks. In addition, a dwarf who is [[Thought#Justice|released]] from a cage gets an enormous [[Emotion|happiness]] boost that will help him [[Stress|cope with]] the loss of [[Relationship|family and friends]] who were not so lucky.

Further improvements to this technique, such as assigning the uncursed to squads with no uniform (or just a helmet), that replaces clothing in order to allow every bite to break the skin, have pushed successful conversion rates to near 50%. It is also recommended to release dwarves from their cages immediately (via constructing the cages and attaching them to a [[lever]]), to prevent [[insanity]] due to unhappiness.

==Werebeast military==
A somewhat less drastic (though potentially even more [[fun]]) option to integrate werebeasts into your fort is to start a werebeast super-soldier breeding program. Some werebeasts can hold and use weapons in beast form, and whatever combat skills they have as dwarves also apply while transformed. Being infected gives dwarves a large increase to their physical attributes (which can still be increased further, unlike vampires), and they need not worry about being wounded in combat as long as they survive until their next transformation. Add to this the beast form's large size of 80000 and inability to feel pain, which partially makes up for its lack of armor, and you end up with a potentially devastating [[military]] force if you can manage to keep them from murdering each other and the rest of your fortress. 

Werebeast soldiers are mostly useful when their beast form is of a variety that can use weapons and preferably also shields, which obviously requires hands of some sort. Weregophers, for example, can use either a shield or a one-handed weapon, but not both, and may even equip crossbows as well as quivers and bolts. It is unknown if dwarves in beast form can wield weapons that are normally too large for them, such as pikes. If they cannot use weapons, they may still be useful as soldiers if their beast form is of the dangerous sort, for example in the case of werelions <s>and tigers and bears</s>.

Transformed military dwarves respect their [[Squad#Station_order|stations]], [[Scheduling|alerts]] and [[Squad#Creating_and_assigning_uniforms|uniforms]] (when applicable) and ignore the civilian alert, but will still attack anything they regard as an enemy, such as their fellow dwarves or any destructible buildings. They must therefore be kept away from the rest of the fortress with walls and bridges, as they will destroy any non-artifact doors.

[[Stupid dwarf trick|Bonus points]] if you also install a dump chute in the room to give them new weapons and booze. Designate a stockpile under the chute, set it to take from links only, disable bins and set it to allow booze, empty barrels, weapons, shields and possibly ammo. Supplying the were-soldiers with booze both keeps them happy and prevents them from wandering into your fortress to look for it. Be aware that they can and will jump out of a hole directly above them, so either make the chute at least 2 z-levels high and smooth the walls, or keep it firmly locked with a hatch cover.

Once their containment room has been built, add a piece of furniture, designate a large barracks from it and set them to train there. The were-soldiers will destroy the barracks while transformed unless it is an artifact, so wall it in after the room has been defined. Remember to use 2-tile thick walls because of the sparring bug above.

An important thing to remember is the following: If two or more transformed dwarves have any sort of active military order (either from an alert or direct orders), and can see each other at the moment they change ''back'' from beast form, then they will instantly begin fighting to the death, causing a loyalty cascade. To avoid this, either train your werebeast soldiers alone in separate rooms (slower due to lack of sparring), or make sure to set their alert to Inactive and cancel all their orders before they change back to dwarves. Once they've changed back, they can be set to train or given orders again. If they do start fighting each other, canceling all their orders and setting them to Inactive will make them stop. 

The soldiers will not train while transformed, but if they were sparring during the transformation they will continue to spar in beast form, which can be entertaining to watch. The combat log for sparring dwarves in wereform will be gray instead of the normal cyan.

==Full Moons / Transformation dates==
In ''Dwarf Fortress'', werebeasts transform only and always on the exact date of the full moon. Note that the transformation lasts for the full date, not just the night.

The Dwarven [[calendar]] has 12 months, each exactly 28 days long (four 7-day weeks each). In ''Dwarf Fortress'', the full moon occurs about* every 26 days, and falls on the same dates every year. This means that there are exactly thirteen full moons in a dwarven year, with 2 full moons falling in the last month, Obsidian.

==Werebeasts in adventure mode==
[[File:DnD Lycantrop.png|thumb|Non-leather clothing will be destroyed on any transformation]]
In adventurer mode, werebeasts are usually found living in small lairs on the edges of civilization. Young adventurers will often be called upon to slay them, with instructions along the line of "he assumes a bestial form" along with a description of what type of metal they are vulnerable to. However, as long as they are not visited on the night of their transformation, they are just common peasants and can be dispatched easily. It would behoove these individuals to hide themselves among townsfolk, but what can ya do?

===Becoming a werebeast===
To become a werebeast, you must either happen upon a werebeast in its beastly form or seek one out on the night of their transformation. The most safe and certain way to permit an infectious werebite is to remove all upper body armor, and only torso armor. The torso is the easiest target and it can sustain more damage than limbs. Getting an appendage bitten or shaken off has a lower probability of penetrating the bloodstream than a bite to the chest area.

Note if you select a form for its advantages: the werebeast form doesn't guarantee the stat ranges their animal type may imply; those are generated completely independently. The beast form only confers a proportionate size/mass increase, the tissue layer materials, and all their attack types.

It is additionally possible to become a werebeast by toppling statues of your god(s) in a temple or sanctuary. Walk up to the statue and topple it with {{K|u}} then {{K|a}}. Toppling a statue in this way will lead you to be cursed: the curse will be either werebeast or [[Vampire|vampirism]] (toppling statues unrelated to your religion has no effect). A simpler way to obtain a werebeast curse is to roll divination [[dice]] to the point of angering the gods. Once you get a message urging you not to tempt fate, another roll of the dice will bestow upon you a curse – which curse you get appears to be randomly decided at the time you topple the statue or roll the dice. Reloading the game and repeating the process often gives the alternate curse.

If you become a werebeast and transform in adventure mode, you can pick up your weapon and shield that were dropped in the transformation, but, seeing as almost all werebeasts seem to have a minimum body size of about 80000, armor will become too [[Clothing#Size|small]] for you to fit into. Hauled items will also be dropped on Fast Travel.

===Implications of being an adventuring werebeast===
'''Pros:'''
*Every full moon, all injuries are instantly healed, then again when the phase ends. This includes otherwise permanent injuries like nerve damage and dismemberment.
*For 30 game hours you are inexhaustible – the perfect time to train your combat skills. You can sustain max movement rate, multi-attack with everything you have, block and dodge without exhaustion limits. Though your physical attributes won't increase, the skill gains will make your natural form much stronger than it was.
*Potential increase to all physical stats, likely increase to all physical stat maximums (your experience may vary; sometimes base and maximum stats are ''lower'' than your normal form).
*Increase in mass that scales up with animal's base size (e.g., a smaller creature adds a marginal amount, a larger creature may gain mass in the 100,000s).
*Acquire all the animal's traits, including swim/climb/crawl rates, innate swimming, physical attacks such as hoof or horn, tissue layer properties such as scales or thick hide.
*Acquiring the curse directly from a god additionally grants agelessness, which, similar to necromancers' agelessness, makes you neutral to undead.

'''Cons:''' 
*You will be attacked if you visit any towns during your transformation. Automatically hostile with everyone except werebeasts of your own species and your base species.
*Having to re-equip yourself every transformation unless transformed size is similar enough to your race's size. Non-leather clothing will be destroyed on any transformation regardless of size difference.
*If enemies are wielding weapons of a material your new form is weak against, damage taken can be devastating.
*Beast form often starts relatively weaker, and its maximum potential may be less than natural form.

==Bugs==
* Ordering your military to kill an infected dwarf may trigger a [[loyalty cascade]], potentially making every single dwarf of the fortress hostile to all others {{Bug|0003259}}. To prevent this, it's safer to dispose of the infected by [[Unfortunate accident|other, more indirect means]], like quarantining them via forbidden doors on hospitals fitted with [[Drowning chamber|hygienic measures]].
* On first transformation, an afflicted character's birth year and time can be set back hundreds to thousands of years {{Bug|0005835}}. This can occur from infection by bite or direct deity curse.
* Infected invaders don't attack the rest of the invasion force when they turn.{{bug|10014}}
* Regardless of whether or not their original race is known, a unit's kill list will always show a defeated werebeast as a member of their starting race, even if transformed. 


{{D for Dwarf}}
Sometimes a werebeast arrives in humanoid form, and the game then announces the arrival of a normal, intelligent creature as if it was some terrible beast. The naked, confused creature usually runs away, probably scared by your dwarves' laughter.

Unlike other werebeasts, werehedgehogs have shown the ability to unnaturally stretch their limbs out for extra mobility, and often attempt to steal rings from your stockpiles.

There have been tales of a Human who would become a Werebeaver when he spent too much time chopping trees. He would carry a legendary talking axe and do his best to not starve. He also had a severe disdain for all birds.
