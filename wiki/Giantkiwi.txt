'''Giant kiwi''' are over-sized flightless birds. While they are not generally threatening, their large size allows them to cause significant damage, particularly to unarmored dwarves. 

Interestingly, the giant kiwi's pet value is nearly double that of almost all other giant creatures. This can make them lucrative live trade goods, but their [[butcher]]ing returns are no more valuable than common domestic livestock. Some dwarves [[preference|admire]] them for their ''great size'' and ''long beaks''.
