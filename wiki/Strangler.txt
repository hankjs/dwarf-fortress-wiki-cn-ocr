'''Stranglers''' are very rare four-armed humanoid [[creature]]s, found only in [[evil]] [[tropical]] moist broadleaf [[forest]]s. They appear in groups of 1-3 and attack anything smaller than themselves. Despite being described as large, they are in fact smaller than [[dwarf|dwarves]], though they may still pose a threat to civilians who provoke them. While they have no real preference for strangling, they can and will scratch and bite their enemies. All stranglers are born with Legendary [[skill]] in [[Climber|climbing]].

While they are humanoid in anatomy, stranglers aren't intelligent creatures. Despite being smaller than an adult [[sheep]], stranglers produce twice the [[butcher]]ing returns, at twice the [[Item value|value]], making them well-worth harvesting if they appear near your fortress. 

Some dwarves [[Preferences|like]] stranglers for their ''resounding hoots'', their ''graceful leaps'', their ''toothy maw'' and their ''three eyes''.
