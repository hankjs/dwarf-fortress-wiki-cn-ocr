'''Giant kangaroos''' are oversized [[creature|cousins]] of the common [[kangaroo]], found in [[savage]] [[temperate]] and [[desert]] [[biome]]s. They are 9 times heavier than their normal cousins and about 14 times heavier than a [[dwarf]], but despite their great size, they are benign and will run away from dwarves who attack them. In the event they fight back, they may deal great damage to civilians, though they'll probably not last long against even an unarmored [[hunter]]. Unlike normal kangaroos, males and females are both simply named giant kangaroos, though their babies are referred to as ''giant kangaroo joeys''.

Giant kangaroos can be captured in [[cage]] [[trap]]s and [[Animal trainer|trained]] into [[pet]]s, possessing the standard value of giant creatures. Their large size means they give a good amount of returns when [[butcher]]ed, and like normal kangaroos, they also serve as a source of [[milk]] and later [[cheese]]. Note, however, that giant kangaroo milk and normal-sized kangaroo milk are completely identical in every aspect. They are exotic [[mount]]s, and so may be used by [[Elf|elves]] during [[siege]]s.

Some dwarves [[Preferences|like]] giant kangaroos for their ''pouches'' and their ''great leaps''.


{{D for Dwarf}}
The methods of riding a giant kangaroo are a matter of discussion among dwarves. Do the elves come hiding inside their pouches, or do the kangaroos give them piggy-back rides? Or, Armok forbid, both? More research is required before conclusions are made.
