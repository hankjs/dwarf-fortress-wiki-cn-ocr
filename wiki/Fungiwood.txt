The '''fungiwood''' is an underground [[tree]], likely related to the [[tower-cap]].

It is found in [[underground]] [[caverns]], providing lemon-colored [[wood]], and can also grow on [[soil]] or [[mud|muddied]] [[rock]].  

Some [[Dwarf|dwarves]] [[Preferences|like]] fungiwoods for their ''fine grain''.
