{{DFtext|Dwarf cancels task: Could not find path.}}

This message obviously means that the dwarf in question could not find a path to the destination for the task. This can be caused by closed and forbidden [[door]]s, [[floodgate]]s, raised or retracted [[drawbridge]]s, or any other physical obstruction of terrain-related nature, such as walls or water.
