'''Flying''' creatures (those with the FLIER creature tag) are capable of moving (and remaining) in [[open space]] tiles, either horizontally, vertically, or diagonally. Flying creatures can prove [[fun|challenging]] since they may be able to bypass some of your fortress's [[trap]]s and defenses, and render others (such as pit traps) completely ineffective.

Flying creatures '''can''' spawn on air tiles at the edge of the map - unlike ground creatures, they do not need a floor to spawn on. This renders raised drawbridges at ground level useless against the spawning of fliers at an embark zone. 

However, it is possible to block off every edge tile at ''every'' Z-level by [[bridge#Improvised walls|using these raised drawbridges]]. This prevents fliers from spawning altogether (although it also prevents existing fliers from leaving the map). 

==Bugs==
*Due to an apparent bug, flying creatures must be able to path to their target '''without''' flying. However when actually moving to the target they will take the most direct route (flying).
*Flying creatures can "exchange tiles" with non-flying creatures, leaving the non-flier stranded somewhere normally unreachable. Flying [[pet]]s, particularly, should be [[pasture]]d somewhere safe to prevent such problems.
