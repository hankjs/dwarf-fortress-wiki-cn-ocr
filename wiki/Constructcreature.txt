[[File:construct_creatures_preview.png|right]]'''Construct creature''' is an unofficial term used{{verify}} by some members of the ''Dwarf Fortress'' community to refer to humanoid [[creature]]s that, while similar to [[animal people]], are derived from non-animal concepts.  This is a bit of a fuzzy term, as the game itself doesn't have the concept of construct creatures (i.e. it doesn't treat them separately), so for the purposes of this page, any creature with a name in the format of "[somethingorother] man" counts (so, for example, [[bronze colossus]]es wouldn't count).

The following construct creatures exist:

* [[File:blizzard_man_sprite.png|16px]] / {{Tile|M|3:0:1}} [[Blizzard man]]
