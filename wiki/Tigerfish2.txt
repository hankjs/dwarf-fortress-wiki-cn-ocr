'''Tigerfish''' are aquatic [[creature]]s that live in [[tropical]] freshwater [[river]]s and [[lake]]s. They appear in clusters of 3 to 7 individuals. They are slightly smaller than a [[dwarf]] and are one of the largest freshwater fish in the game. While their name and description make them out as predatory and aggressive animals, tigerfish are completely benign meaning they are more likely to run away if a dwarf approaches it. In spite of their benignness they are fully capable of tearing and shaking an unarmed dwarf to a corpse if provoked.

As non-[[vermin]] fish, tigerfish can't be fished by [[Fisherdwarf|fisherdwarves]], but can be caught with the use of a [[drowning chamber]]. Infant tigerfish are called ''tigerfish fry''.

Some dwarves [[Preferences|like]] tigerfish for their ''spirit''.

==In real life==

While it is not specified in the raws, its rather big size suggest that this fish is presumably based on the [[wikipedia:Hydrocynus goliath|Goliath tigerfish]]. They can grow up to 1.5 meters (4.9 ft) long.
