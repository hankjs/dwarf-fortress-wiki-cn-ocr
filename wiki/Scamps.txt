'''Scamps''' was the [[pet]] [[cat]] who adopted the [[Toady One]]. Scamps was useful for preventing unhappy [[thoughts]]. He was born on February 9th, 2009, and lived with the Adams brothers until June 15th, 2022, when he passed away from widespread lymphoma at the ripe old cat age of 13.

Scamps is not a traditional megabeast. Scamps adopts his victim while he is a kitten. When Scamps hits adulthood, he slashes the victim's throat and drinks their blood, turning Scamps back into a kitten, similar to a Fountain of Youth. Beware its dangerous eyes!

[[Image:Scamps.png|thumb|center|400px|This is a masterful memorial to Scamps created by Tarn "Toady One" Adams. The slab reads "In memory of Scamps / 2009 - 2022 / Slayer of shoes". ([[Scamps/gallery|more]])]]
