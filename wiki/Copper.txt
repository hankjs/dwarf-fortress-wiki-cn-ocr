'''Copper''' is a [[metal]] used in a large number of alloys, among them [[bronze]], which is almost as good as [[iron]] for smithing [[weapon]]s and [[armor]], and [[brass]], which has the largest value increase of all non-[[steel]] alloys. Copper itself is a common, low-value metal and a sub-par arms material – more specifically, it is the second-worst metal available for slashing weapons, but is pretty good for blunt weapons.

Copper is [[fire-safe]] but ''not'' [[magma-safe]].

== Major uses ==

*Early-game melee weapon and armor production, if you have no [[tin]] to make [[bronze]] or no [[iron]]. You will probably do best to find better metals though.
*Making [[pick|picks]] (As of update 53.07, pickaxe material affects mining speed, and copper pickaxe is the slowest.)
*Making [[bronze]], which is better overall than copper for military applications.
*Training metalworking dwarves: copper is generally plentiful. This is possibly the best use for copper if you have better metals.
*Copper [[crossbow|crossbows]] and copper [[bolts]]. Copper crossbows are the best crossbows if your [[marksdwarves]] are forced into melee – [[silver]] crossbows are only brought by humans and have no quality modifiers. Copper bolts are heavy enough and sharp enough to work as a good projectile, and iron/steel is generally too rare to be used in bolts. Both uses also train your [[weaponsmith]]s, which is always a good thing.
*Bins, cages, and barrels: although wooden ones are generally cheaper and lighter, copper containers are fire-safe and resistant to [[vermin]]. On maps where wood is scarce, copper can serve as a suitable substitute.
*Copper giant spiked balls for weapon [[trap]]s.

== Alloys ==

Copper is smelted (at a [[smelter]]) from [[native copper]], [[malachite]], or [[tetrahedrite]]. 

Copper may be combined with other metals at a [[smelter]]. The following is a list of recipes involving copper:
*[[Brass]] = Copper + [[Zinc]]
*[[Bronze]] = Copper + [[Tin]]
*[[Billon]] = Copper + [[Silver]]
*[[Fine pewter]] = Copper + 3× [[Tin]]
*[[Trifle pewter]] = Copper + 2× [[Tin]]
*[[Lay pewter]] = Copper + 2× [[Tin]] + [[Lead]]
*[[Nickel silver]] = Copper + 2× [[Nickel]] + [[Zinc]]
*[[Black bronze]] = 2× Copper + [[Silver]] + [[Gold]]
*[[Sterling silver]] = Copper + 3× [[Silver]]
*[[Rose gold]] = Copper + 3× [[Gold]]
*[[Bismuth bronze]] = 2× Copper + [[Tin]] + [[Bismuth]]
