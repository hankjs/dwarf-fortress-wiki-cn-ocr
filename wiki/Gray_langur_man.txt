'''Gray langur men''' are humanoid versions of the common [[gray langur]] and a [[Creature|species]] of [[animal people]], found in a variety of [[savage]] [[biome]]s. They are a bit over half the size of [[dwarf|dwarves]] when adults and spawn in groups of 5-10 individuals. They share the same [[Thief|thieving]] disposition of normal langurs, and their greater size in comparison to the animals may make them a threat to civilians who get into fights with them. All gray langur men possess Legendary [[skill]] in [[Climber|climbing]].

Like other savage animal people, gray langur men may occasionally join [[civilization]]s, becoming full-fledged citizens who may appear in your fortress as [[visitor]]s or be playable in [[adventurer mode]].

Some dwarves [[Preferences|like]] gray langur men for their ''social nature'' and their ''vocalizations''.
