'''Native silver''' is an ore of [[silver]], a mid-value metal. Native silver may also be [[Smelter|smelted]] with other ores to create [[electrum]] and [[billon]]. Native silver can be found as veins in [[gneiss]] and [[granite]]. When mined, hunks of native silver are called ''silver nuggets''.

[[Horn silver]] is mostly identical to native silver, other than its name and physical properties. [[Tetrahedrite]] and [[galena]] are related ores which, once smelted, '''may''' produce a bar of silver.

== In Real Life ==
Native silver is not technically an ore; it's just chunks of mostly pure metallic silver, naturally formed.  As silver is not very reactive, as metals go, this is not an extremely uncommon form to find silver in.
