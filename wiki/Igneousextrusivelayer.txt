'''Igneous extrusive''' [[stone layers]] are formed from [[andesite]], [[basalt]], [[dacite]], [[obsidian]], and [[rhyolite]].  Of these five, andesite, dacite, and rhyolite are functionally identical, different only in appearance and name, basalt is like the other three except that it is magma-safe, and obsidian is... unique.

==In Real Life==
In real-world geology, Igneous extrusive [[stone]] is formed by lava solidifying above the surface, open to the air. This is the main point of difference from [[igneous intrusive layer|igneous intrusive]] stone, which solidifies below the surface. This distinction is kept in ''Dwarf Fortress'' geology, with extrusive being the top layer around volcanoes and never the bottom-most layer, while intrusive is always the bottom layer and never the top.
