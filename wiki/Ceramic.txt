A '''ceramic''' is an inorganic, non-metallic solid prepared by the action of heat and subsequent cooling. In Dwarf Fortress, there are 3 types of ceramic materials - [[earthenware]], [[stoneware]], and [[porcelain]].

Ceramic goods are produced at the [[kiln]] using [[fuel]] with either [[clay]]/[[clay loam]]/[[sandy clay]]/[[silty clay]] (earthenware), [[fire clay]] (stoneware), or [[kaolinite]] (porcelain). A [[magma kiln]] can also be used, in which case no fuel is required.  In Dwarf Fortress, there are no clay products that do not require a kiln.

Ceramics are [[fire-safe]] but not [[magma-safe]] (melting point: {{ct|11500}}), and [[dragonfire]] is capable of melting and boiling ceramic material.

== Uses ==
Ceramics can be used to make [[statue]]s, [[block]]s (labeled as "bricks"), [[trade good|crafts]], [[hive|hives]] for [[Beekeeping industry|beekeeping]], [[jug]]s for storing liquids, and [[large pot]]s for storing food.  Some [[instruments]] or instrument parts can be made from ceramic, depending on world generation. Jugs and pots made from earthenware must first be [[glaze]]d before they can be used to store liquids, while containers made from other materials are naturally resistant to water.

Kaolinite is fairly limited on most maps.  You might want to train your potters using clay and save the kaolinite for when your potters have high skill levels.  You can do this indirectly by forbidding all of your kaolinite in the Stocks menu, or by linking kilns to stockpiles that don't accept kaolinite.
