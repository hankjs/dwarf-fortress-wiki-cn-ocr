'''Pig iron''' bars can be created at a [[smelter]] by a dwarf with the [[Furnace_operator|furnace operating]] labor activated.

The recipe for pig iron is: one [[iron]] [[bar]], one [[flux]] material, and one unit of [[fuel]] will create one pig iron bar. Note that the fuel is part of the reaction as a source of carbon - even when using a [[magma smelter]] you will need one unit of fuel, and for a normal smelter you will need two, with the second unit being used to ''fuel'' the smelter. The flux material must be a [[stone]], not a block, and the fuel must be coke or charcoal, not wood.

Pig iron is mainly used as a component in the manufacture of [[steel]] but can also be used for buildings and constructions that allow bars and have no restrictions on what type of [[bar]]s to use; however, it cannot be used to make any other products. It is possible to [[decoration|stud]] other objects with pig iron, although the option isn't available at the forge, and instead needs to be ordered by the [[manager]]. 

Dwarves can have a [[preference]] for pig iron and will be happier in a room whose floors and walls are made of it. Keeping a few spare pig iron bars may be marginally useful for [[strange mood]]s.

{{D for Dwarf}}
After years of extensive dwarven research, scientists have concluded that no, pig iron is not related to [[pig]]s in any way, and is therefore impossible to craft into ☼steel bacon☼.

Stories of a [[skill|legendary]] [[ranger]] carrying pig iron on his hip are so far unproven. Some sources contest this translation that the myths of the ranger are in fact referring to carrying big iron on his hip. Unfortunately this occurrence is quite common and as such no specific [[ranger]] has been identified.

== In real life ==
Pig iron is a high-carbon iron that is an intermediate product in the production of wrought iron as well as steel. It is very brittle and thus, as in ''Dwarf Fortress'', only marginally useful except as a step towards better materials. Its name comes from the traditional shape of pig iron castings, consisting of a central runner with ingots on each side at right angles, resembling a sow suckling a litter of piglets.
