'''Bluefish''' are a species of [[Creature|fish]] who can be found in [[temperate]] and [[tropical]] [[ocean]]s in groups of 5-10 individuals. Only half the size of a [[dog]], they provide a small amount of returns when [[butcher]]ed. As non-[[vermin]] fish, bluefish can't be fished by [[Fisherdwarf|fisherdwarves]], but can be caught with the use of a [[drowning chamber]]. Infant bluefish are called ''bluefish fry''.

Some dwarves [[Preferences|like]] bluefish for their ''coloration''.
