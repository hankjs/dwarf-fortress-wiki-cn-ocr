'''Warthogs''' are wild [[Creature|animals]] who inhabit [[tropical]] [[savanna]]s, [[grassland]]s, and [[shrubland]]s, appearing in clusters of 3 to 7 individuals. While they're heavier than the average [[dwarf]] (being larger than both [[pig]]s and [[wild boar]]s), they're benign meanderers by nature and are more likely to flee from confrontation than pose any threat to your fortress, though in the event of a fight, they'll defend themselves with bites, kicks and by trying to stab their enemies with their tusks. A newborn warthog is called a ''piglet''.

Warthogs can be captured in [[cage]] [[trap]]s and [[Animal trainer|trained]] into exotic [[pet]]s of fair value. For a [[meat industry]], they're essentially better than wild boars, but unlike pigs, they provide no [[milk]]. Unlike other swines, trained warthogs are [[grazer]]s and as such require a constant source of [[grass]], preferably in a [[pasture]].

Some dwarves [[Preferences|like]] warthogs for their ''short tempers''.
