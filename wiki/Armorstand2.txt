'''Armor stands''' are a type of [[furniture]]. Much like the [[weapon rack]], the armor stand can be used inside a [[barracks]]. Once built an armor stand can be placed with {{Menu icon|b|y|r}}. It can also be placed in a [[noble]]'s [[Zone|room]] to fulfill their [[Noble#Needs|housing requirements]].

When used in a barracks designated for individual and squad equipment, dwarves will prefer to store their armor on stands instead of stockpiles. Doing so in concert with [[weapon rack]]s will allow you to create centralized armories for your military.

In [[tombs]] designated for [[nobles]] or [[military|military dwarves]], armor stands will be used to store the deceased dwarf's armor.

Armor stands do not block movement.
