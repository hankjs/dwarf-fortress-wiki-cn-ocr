'''Cutteflish men''' are [[animal people]] variants of the common [[cuttlefish]] who can be found in [[savage]] [[ocean]]s. They spawn in groups of 1-5 individuals and are generally content to keep to themselves. In terms of size, they are a little over half the weight of the average [[dwarf]].

While they can learn and are able to join [[civilization]]s, they never do so, as they are completely [[aquatic]] and cannot survive on the surface.

Some dwarves [[Preferences|like]] cuttlefish men for their ''ability to change color'' and their ''distinctive pupils''.

Legends tell of an ancient '''cuttlefish man''', a terrifying sea creature that surpassed all other [[Forgotten beast|forgotten beasts]] in both size and strength. This cuttlefish man was known to incite random [[Strange mood|fits of madness]] in nearby fortresses and to inspire dark cults to worship it. It is widely believed by these cults that this ancient cuttlefish man will rise from the ocean at the end of time, only to destroy all of civilization. Only time will tell if this is true, and whether any weapons of mortal man will be able to destroy such a creature.
However, this dreaded creature is known to have one weakness, with which to drive it back to its home in the depths: the humble [[steam]] boat. Pray to [[Armok]] that boats are added to the game before this nightmare becomes a reality.
This monstrosity lives in a legendary place, constructed with alien geometry, named R'lyeh.

Some elderly cuttlefish men have been observed aiding trainee [[squid man|squid men]] soldiers in their war against the [[octopus man|octopus men]].
