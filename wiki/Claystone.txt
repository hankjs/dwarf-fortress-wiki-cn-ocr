'''Claystone''' is an unremarkable [[sedimentary]] [[stone]]. Similar to [[clay]], it will not sustain an [[aquifer]]. Unlike clay, claystone cannot be used for [[ceramic industry|ceramics]].

==In real life==
[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Claystone '''Claystone'''] is composed primarily of [[clay]]-sized particles. It is not to be confused with [[shale]], which splits into thin layers, and is distinct from [[mudstone]] in that it is fully hardened.
