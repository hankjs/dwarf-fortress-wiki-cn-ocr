'''Giant axolotls''' are [[giant animal]] versions of the common [[axolotl]] who inhabit [[savage]] [[tropical]] [[lake]]s. While their original counterparts are just [[vermin]], these [[creature]]s are over 3 times bigger than a [[dwarf]]. They spawn individually and not particularly aggressive, but are not benign and will attack other creatures (including dwarves) who provoke them, potentially killing them.

Giant axolotls can be captured in [[cage]] [[trap]]s and [[Animal trainer|trained]] into [[pet]]s, possessing the standard giant creature pet value. They are born adults and cannot be permanently tamed. They produce an adequate amount of products when [[butcher]]ed (comparable to a [[cow]]), and as such may serve as a choice for novelty livestock. They are also fairly long-lived compared to most giant vermin, and since they're born as fully-sized adults, they can start producing more of themselves fairly quickly, provided a breeding pair is obtained. They are exotic [[mount]]s and may be witnessed being ridden by [[Elf|elves]] during [[siege]]s.

Some dwarves [[Preferences|like]] giant axolotls for their ''gills''.
