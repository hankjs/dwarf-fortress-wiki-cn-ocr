'''Jaguar men''' are [[animal people]] variants of the common [[jaguar]] who can be found in [[savage]] [[desert]]s and [[tropical]] regions. They spawn in groups of 1-5 individuals and are generally content to keep to themselves. In terms of size, they are a little larger than the average [[human]].

Like other savage animal people, they can join [[civilization]]s, become [[historical figure]]s, appear as [[visitor]]s and be playable in [[adventurer mode]]. Jaguar men make a good choice for players in adventurer mode, as they can wear human-sized [[armour]].

Some dwarves [[Preferences|like]] jaguar men for their ''spotted coats''.

{{D for Dwarf}}
Despite the insistence of human [[scholar]]s, there is no evidence of jaguar man [[soldier]]s holding any preference to using [[obsidian]] [[short sword]]s.
