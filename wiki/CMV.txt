The '''CMV''' file format is used for recording movies within ''Dwarf Fortress''. Movies can be recorded in-game by pressing {{key|;}} from anywhere within the game and following the instructions. CMV files can be played back in-game from the same {{key|;}} menu (which works from any screen, including the opening menu screen) or by using a 3rd party player (of which there had been only two in the game's entire existence so far) .

Tools also exist to convert CMV files to animated .gif format, such as milo christiansen's [http://www.bay12forums.com/smf/index.php?topic=147803.0 CMV to GIF] command line utility.

==Movie Archive==
Since September 2007, members of the DF community have been able to [http://mkv25.net/dfma/addmovie.php share] and [http://mkv25.net/dfma/browsemovies.php watch] CMV movies with other players in the community through the movie pages on the [[Utility:Dwarf_Fortress_Map_Archive|DF Map Archive]]. This was thanks in part to '''gonbon''' who wrote and provided the flash based CMV Player for use in the community.

==Historical notes==
In August 2008 [[Main:Toady One|Toady One]] upgraded the recording capabilities of ''Dwarf Fortress'' to support grid sizes larger than the standard 80x25.

==CCMV File format== 
In order to boost the compression of CMV files, SL introduced a Compressed CMV file format (CCMV) using a single pass through zlib on the final file data. This compression is compatible with the Flash player on the DFMA. The smaller file size means quicker downloads but breaks any streaming functionality that would have been possible with the standard CMV file format.

==File format==
* Jifodus's user page has a table describing the [[User:Jifodus/CMV_file_format|CMV file format]].
* Markavian's user page has an updated version expressed as a [[User:Markavian/CMV_file_format|C# CMV Class]], based on optimization code written by [http://shadowlord13.googlepages.com/dfmap-index.html SL], and header information forwarded by Toady One.

Some dwarves claim to see Armok holding a strange device with a red light, though these are merely passed off as rumors.
