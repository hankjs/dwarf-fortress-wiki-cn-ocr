'''Axolotl men''' are humanoid versions of the common [[axolotl]] and a [[Creature|species]] of unremarkable [[animal people]], found in [[savage]] [[tropical]] [[lake]]s. They are a bit over half the size of [[dwarf|dwarves]] when adults and spawn in groups of 1-5 individuals. They should pose no threat to [[Dwarf|dwarves]] unless provoked.

Like other savage animal people, axolotl men may occasionally join [[civilization]]s, becoming full-fledged citizens who may appear in your fortress as [[visitor]]s or be playable in [[adventurer mode]].

Some dwarves [[Preferences|like]] axolotl men for their ''gills''.

{{D for Dwarf}}
Despite their cute appearance, axolotl men are known for their short temper and will go berserk easily.
