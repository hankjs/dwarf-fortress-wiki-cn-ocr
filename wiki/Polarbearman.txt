'''Polar bear men''' are [[animal people]] versions of the [[polar bear]] that inhabit [[savage]] [[tundra]]s and [[glacier]]s. They spawn in groups of 2-10 individuals and can pose a threat to passing civilians. In terms of size, they are almost 4 times larger than a [[dwarf]] and should not be trifled with, though they will stand little chance against an armed [[military]] [[squad]]. Polar bear men love [[alcohol]] and will happily steal it and drink it from [[stockpiles]]. As a result, they may consume an entire caravan's reserves when arriving in a savage area, if the [[wagon]] is left unguarded, not hesitating to drink themselves to death if the supply happens to be sufficient - thus, polar bear men can be lured into traps baited with alcohol stockpiles by placing them behind [[cage traps]].  
Like other savage animal people, they can join [[civilization]]s, become [[historical figure]]s, appear as [[visitor]]s and be playable in [[adventurer mode]].

Some dwarves [[Preferences|like]] polar bear men for their ''strength''.
