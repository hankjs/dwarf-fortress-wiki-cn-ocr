'''Wood burner''' is the [[skill]] associated with the wood burning [[labor]], where [[Dwarf|dwarves]] turn [[wood]] into either [[ash]] or [[charcoal]] at a [[wood furnace]]. Dwarves with high skill level accomplish these tasks more quickly. Typically, a wood stockpile and a bar/block stockpile are placed near the furnaces.

==How do I get dwarves to burn wood?==

Wood burner is, somewhat tenuously, considered a farming-related job (because [[ash]] can be made into [[potash]], which fertilizes fields) and thus the labor is filed under Farming/''Related'' labor menu, and not [[Furnace operator|furnace operating]].
