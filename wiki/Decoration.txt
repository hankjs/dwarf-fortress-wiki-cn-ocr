'''Decorations''' are fancy embellishments of your goods that, while unnecessary, greatly add to their value for [[trade]] and other purposes by adding another material to the base item. Decorating with a material already present in the object, whether as its base or as an earlier decoration, is not possible. You can, however, place numerous decorations on a single item – the only limit is the number of materials you have available. Most decorations have quality levels: a base value of 10☼, multiplied by its [[Item_value#Material multipliers|material multiplier]] and [[Quality|quality multiplier]], separate from the item itself. When an item is decorated, that is [[Item designations|designated]] with double angle brackets - for example, a +steel battle axe+ with a base-quality decoration becomes a «+steel battle axe+». Decoration quality is shown outside the double angle-brackets, the item quality remains within them with the item. So if you have *«+steel battle axe+»*, you have a +steel battle axe+ with *decorations* on it. When an item has more than one decoration, the quality level of the best one is shown.

There are a number of caveats to these embellishments: 
* [[Weapon]] decorations do not affect combat multipliers, even if your maul "menaces with spikes of steel." 
* Adding decorations to an item does not increase its weight; this may be a bug. 
* Decorations on "grey" items (with brackets) that were gained in battle, or stolen from or traded with a [[caravan]], certify the product as "home-made" (brown), and make it count for your exports.

You cannot pick a specific object for a dwarf to decorate; their [[path]]ing will cause them to use the closest suitable object (which is generally not what you want decorated), but ignoring items which are assigned to stockpiles. With the addition of linked [[stockpile]]s, it is possible to set up more sophisticated methods of decoration: set up a stockpile exclusively containing the type of item you want to decorate, set up another stockpile with the decorations you want used, and set both stockpiles to {{k|g}}ive to the related workshop. Failing that, locking all the desired content up (including the workshop and misbehaving dwarf) ''Rumpelstiltskin''-style, is the classic way to "specify" what to decorate. Using a linked stockpile in which the desired items are contained in bins, causes the craftsdwarf to also decorate the bins (once they are no longer assigned to the stockpile and the particular decoration job does allow for furniture to be decorated). While it is being decorated, other dwarves may replace the bin, possibly repeating this unwanted process. You can probably work around this, by using an in-between-stockpile, taking from the bin-stockpile and giving to the craftshop, but without bins enabled.

The different civilizations have different tastes when it comes to decorations, and consequently may offer (or ask for) more, or less, than the item value shown on the item information screen. For example, [[Hippies|elves]] dislike spikes and will not adorn their own items with them, and will also refuse to offer anything for the decoration (except for the bonus value due to decoration quality, ie. masterwork spikes will give 30, while no-quality spikes will give no increase). On the other hand, they will estimate a decoration depicting a [[tree]] at twice its normal value, because elves like trees so much. (''Or, images of [[Force|'''religious significance''']], so to speak''.) 

These modifiers only affect the value of the decorations themselves, not of the base item. They also only affect values when trading with visiting [[Trading|merchants]], the fortress-internal value ratings are unaffected by such preferences. Most of the modifiers are regulated by entries in the entity_default [[raw file]]. 

== Types of decoration ==
[[File:Axe decorated.jpg|thumb|This is an exceptional <*«≡steel battle axe≡»*>. It menaces with spikes of superior quality goblin bone.]]
;Bone, Hoof, Ivory or tooth, Pearl, Shell 
:At a [[craftsdwarf's workshop]], objects can be decorated with [[bone]], [[hoof]], [[ivory]] or [[tooth]], and [[shell]].  (In theory, objects could also be decorated with [[pearl]], but since that doesn't exist yet, this isn't possible.)  Requires [[bone carving]].  You cannot choose what kind of object to decorate.

;Gems
:At a [[jeweler's workshop]], objects can be encrusted with [[Gem|cut gem]]s (including cut [[glass]] or cut [[stone]]s). You may specify whether to decorate furniture, finished goods or ammo.  Requires [[gem setting]]. Decorations made of cut gems (but '''not''' glass or stone) have a base value of 20☼.

;Metal studs
:At a [[metalsmith's forge]], objects can be studded with various metals. Requires [[metalcrafting]], but '''does not''' require [[fuel]]. The type of metal is chosen by the player, but the type of object is not.
:There are several ways to place this work order:
:* In a [[metalsmith's forge]] or [[magma forge]], open the workshop [Tasks] menu, and "Add new task". Select "Other objects", and then select the type of metal that you wish to stud an item with. In that menu, scroll to the very bottom, and select "Stud with <''metal type''>". 
:* Alternately, you can place a formal [[work order]] there. Simply open the [Work orders] tab, and find the "stud with <''metal type''>" of your choice. 
:* A work order can also be done via the main Work Orders menu (default shortcut {{k|o}} ). Click "Create a new work order" and type "stud with <''metal type''>" in the search bar to place that order there. Select a specific workshop or not, as you prefer.
:Remember that you cannot decorate with a material already present in the item to be decorated. This can be limiting, e.g. when all materials must be [[magma-safe]].

;Cloth
:At a [[clothier's shop]], [[cloth]] images (plant fiber, silk and yarn) can be sewn onto cloth and [[leather]] items, notably including leather armor, bags, ropes, and cloth and leather [[craft]]s. Requires [[clothier|clothesmaking]]. 

;Leather
:At a [[leather works]], leather images can be sewn onto cloth and leather items, with the same options and restrictions as the sewing of cloth images. Requires [[leatherworking]].

Notes: 
* On cloth and leather decorations: Only one image can be sewn onto an item. You cannot sew leather images onto items which already bear a cloth image and vice versa, and you cannot sew multiple images made of different leather or cloth types onto the same item.
* Statues appear to be able to be decorated with gems to create images, also allowing multiple images to be added as decorations.{{verify}}
* Images can take many forms, often influenced by the artist's preferences or interests. [[Names_and_symbols#Symbols|Group symbols]] can be depicted in engravings.

(1) only finished goods made from cloth and leather are acceptable. These are ropes, quivers, waterskins, backpacks and cloth/leather crafts.

== Notes ==
*Dwarves will decorate [[wear|worn]] clothing and other abandoned junk that was left in the workshop, linked stockpiles, or in close proximity to the workshop.
