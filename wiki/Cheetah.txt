'''Cheetahs''' are very rare [[creature]]s who inhabit [[tropical]] flatlands, where they roam as solitary hunters. These carnivore predators are nearly as heavy as a [[dwarf]] and may present a problem to small [[domestic animal]]s, though they're likely to avoid dwarves themselves. As expected of the species, cheetahs are incredibly fast runners, running at 87 km/h (the max [[gait]] speed handled by the game), making them the fastest animals on land. A newborn cheetah is called a ''cub''.

Cheetahs can be captured in [[cage]] [[trap]]s and [[Animal trainer|trained]] into valuable exotic [[pet]]s, and fully tame cheetahs can sometimes be brought in [[Elf|elven]] [[caravan]]s. They can be further trained into war or hunting beasts, with their speed making them particularly good for dealing with fast intruders like [[kobold]]s. They can be [[butcher]]ed for a decent amount of returns, though their rarity makes this a possible waste of a good cheetah unless a breeding pair is obtained. Products made from cheetah parts are [[Item value|worth]] thrice more than those made from common creatures.

Some dwarves [[Preferences|like]] cheetahs for their ''speed''.
