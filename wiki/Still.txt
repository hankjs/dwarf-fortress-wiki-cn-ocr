The '''still''' is the source of all home-made [[alcohol]] for a fort and is an essential [[workshop]] for any fortress. A still also allows dwarves to extract [[gnomeblight]] from [[kobold bulb]]s into a [[glass]] [[vial]]. A dwarf must have the [[brewer]] [[labor]] activated in order to use a still.

The four tasks available at a still are:
* Extract from Plants
* Brew drink from plant
* Brew drink from fruit
* Make mead

Brewing alcohol requires an available empty [[barrel]] or [[large pot]] and something to brew, either a [[Alcohol#List of alcohol|brewable plant]], fruit, or [[honey]]. You may set specific plants and fruits to be used or not used through the {{menu icon|y}} Labor menu in Kitchen tab. Note that you are unable to set [[honey bee]] honey to be brewed or not brewed, because making mead is a different task than brewing.

Every unit of plant, fruit, or honey brewed at a still produces 5 units of alcohol. A single [[stack]] of plants will be brewed for each task, and the resulting booze will be placed into a single barrel - a stack of ''Plump helmet [5]'' will produce ''Dwarven wine [25]'' and will only occupy a single barrel. Skilled [[grower]]s, who tend to plant [[seed]]s more skillfully and produce larger stacks, can therefore reduce the number of barrels required to store alcohol, which in turn minimizes the required stockpile size. Brewing produces seeds from ingredients that have seeds if the number of those seeds in the fortress is less than the per-plant limit of 200 (this number can be modified in the [[Settings#Population_and_seed_capacities|settings]]).
