'''Bushmaster men''' are [[animal people]] variants of the common [[bushmaster]], who can be found in [[savage]] [[tropical]] moist broadleaf [[forest]]s, spawning in groups of 1-3 individuals, and share their animal counterparts' [[syndrome]], leading to a quick death by asphyxiation to those they bite - because of this, they should be approached with caution. In terms of size, they are a little over half the weight of the average [[dwarf]].

Like other savage animal people, bushmaster men can join [[civilization]]s, become [[historical figure]]s, appear as [[visitor]]s and be playable in [[adventurer mode]].

Some dwarves [[Preferences|like]] bushmaster men for their ''deadly bite''.
