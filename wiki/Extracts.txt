[[File:extracts.jpg|thumb|170px|right|Sadly, not as important as alcohol.]]'''"Extracts"''' is a general term used to classify various types of substances derived from animals or plants. Non-food extracts do not have a purpose in the current build except as export goods.

==Producing extracts==
A variety of buildings allow you to produce extracts:

===Butcher's shop===
{{main|Butcher's shop}}
Certain [[vermin]] will yield extracts at the butcher's shop by using the {{k|e}}xtract from a dead animal task, requiring a living caged animal, a glass [[vial]] (metal flasks will not work), and a dwarf with the [[Animal dissector|small animal dissection]] labor enabled.

*[[Fire snake]]s create [[liquid fire]]
*[[Phantom spider]]s create [[venom]]
*[[Cave spider]]s create venom
*[[Bark scorpion]]s create bark scorpion venom

===Farmer's workshop===
{{main|Farmer's workshop}}
With the appropriate caged animal and a [[milker]], [[barrel]]s, and [[bucket]]s you can produce milk at the farmer's workshop.
* Live (untamed) [[purring maggot]]s create [[Dwarven milk]], worth 2☼ per unit
* Milk can be cooked to make food, or turned into [[cheese]].

[[Golden salve]] can be created from [[valley herb]]s, requiring a [[vial]] and a dwarf with the [[plant processing]] labor enabled:
* 1 valley herb makes 5 units of golden salve, worth 100☼ per unit

[[Dwarven syrup]] is created via "Process plants (barrel)"
* 1 [[Sweet pod]] makes 5 dwarven syrup, worth 20☼ per unit. 
* Syrup can be cooked to make food.

[[Milk]] is created via "Milk Creature," requiring an empty bucket, an empty barrel (or available space in an existing milk barrel), a mature, non-pet, milkable animal, and a dwarf with the [[milker]] labor enabled. See the [[milk]] and [[cheese]] pages for more details.

===Still===
{{main|Still}}
[[Gnomeblight]] can be created from [[Kobold bulb]]s at a still via "Extract from plant", requiring a [[vial]] and a dwarf with the [[Plant gathering]] labor enabled:
* 1 Kobold bulb makes 5 units of Gnomeblight, worth 100☼ per unit

===Fishery===
{{main|Fishery}}
With a living caged fish and a [[fish dissector]], you can get extracts from our aquatic neighbors.
* 1 [[Moghopper]] makes five units of [[Mog juice]], worth 50☼ per unit

===Import only===
Currently, there are some extracts that cannot be produced on-site and need to be imported.

Various types of [[venom]] can also be purchased, but currently have no use:
*[[Snakeman]] Venom
*[[Giant cave spider]] Venom

Occasionally caravans will bring a barrel filled with some creature's [[blood]].
{{D for Dwarf}}

The blood should be purchased in large quantities to offer to Armok in case you are unable to produce it in times of hardship.


Birdmen [[Scholars]] have theorized a way of extracting from elves, possibly using [[gem|gems]] and a source of power. Though this would be a great service to the world, (plus all that tasty [[elf]] juice to sell for aforementioned [[Armok]][[emotion|-pleasing]] blood [[barrel|barrels]]) unfortunately no such machine has been devised.
