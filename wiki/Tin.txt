'''Tin''' is an uncommon, low-value [[metal]] whose only ore is [[cassiterite]]. Although it is not very useful itself, it is a component in the creation of a number of valuable [[alloy]]s, such as [[fine pewter]] (used for decorations and furniture) and [[bronze]] (also useful for weapons). On its own, tin is not magma safe, or even fire safe, and will melt in a grass fire.

If you have a lot of cassiterite, it might be better to use it for [[tin glaze]] rather than tin bars.  Tin bars cannot be used for tin glaze.


* [[Lay pewter]]     =  2× Tin + [[Copper]] + [[Lead]]
* [[Fine pewter]]    =  3× Tin + [[Copper]]
* [[Trifle pewter]]  =  2× Tin + [[Copper]]
* [[Bronze]]         =  Tin + [[Copper]]
* [[Bismuth bronze]] =  Tin + 2× [[Copper]] + [[Bismuth]]
