A '''revealed tile''', in [[fortress mode]], is any tile that has a description when pointed at with the mouse. 

All [[Tile attributes|above ground]] tiles on the map start out revealed, as do all tiles above the surface. All [[Tile attributes|subterranean]] tiles must be revealed by [[mining|digging]] into them. All tiles adjacent to a dug tile on the same level will also be revealed, including diagonally: you can see what the rock walls adjacent to a mined-out tile are made of, for instance, and you can see the outermost tile of each z-level of a mountain. You can also see the tile immediately below where a downward or up/down [[stairs|stairway]] has been placed -- this is because building (or digging) the stairway removes the [[floor]] between the levels. Upward stairways do not reveal the level above, because they do not remove the floor/ceiling above the stairs.

Underground features like [[cavern]]s and [[Magma#Magma_pools|magma pool]]s start out hidden and must be discovered by miners. Walls next to water or magma, including vertically, will be damp or warm, and dig designations for such walls will be cancelled when revealed to avoid potentially flooding the fortress with what is beyond them. Upon breaching a feature, a message will be displayed informing the player of the discovery, and a chunk of the new feature "within view" of your dwarves will be revealed. See the Methods of exploration section of the [[cavern]]s article for information on safely revealing more of the underground.
