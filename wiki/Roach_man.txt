'''Roach men''' are humanoid versions of the common [[large roach]] and a [[Creature|species]] of unremarkable [[animal people]], found in most non-freezing [[savage]] [[biome]]s. They are only a little over half the size of an adult [[dwarf]] and are unlikely to pose a threat to a fortress' inhabitants. All roach men are born with Legendary [[skill]] in [[Climber|climbing]].

Like other savage animal people, roach men may occasionally join [[civilization]]s, becoming full-fledged citizens who may appear in your fortress as [[visitor]]s or be playable in [[adventurer mode]].

Some dwarves [[Preferences|like]] roach men for their ''ability to disgust''.
