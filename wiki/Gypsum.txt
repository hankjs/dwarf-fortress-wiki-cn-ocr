'''Gypsum''' is an ordinary [[stone]] with a niche use for dwarven [[healthcare]] - once mined, it can be processed at a [[kiln]] to make [[gypsum plaster]] powder, which is in turn used to make [[plaster cast]]s.  A fort with no gypsum can use [[splint]]s as an alternative.

Gypsum can also contain small [[cluster]]s of [[selenite]], [[satinspar]], and [[alabaster]], which can also be made into plaster powder, as well as [[anhydrite]], which cannot.
