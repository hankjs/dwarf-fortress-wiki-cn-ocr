'''Chinchilla men''' are [[animal people]] variants of the common [[chinchilla]], who can inhabit [[savage]] [[mountain]]s, spawning in groups of 3-5 individuals, and are generally content to keep to themselves. In terms of size, they are a little over half the weight of the average [[dwarf]].

Like other savage animal people, chinchilla men can join [[civilization]]s, become historical figures, appear as [[visitor]]s and be playable in [[adventurer mode]].

Some dwarves [[Preferences|like]] chinchilla men for their ''fur''.
