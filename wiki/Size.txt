:''You may be looking for size of [[clothing]], [[armor]], the dimensions of a [[tile]], or the [[List_of_creatures_by_adult_size|list of creatures by size.]]''

'''Size''' is a measure of how big a [[creature]] or [[item]] is, as volume in cubic centimeters{{cite forum|30026.msg831163#msg831163}}, and called {{token|BODY_SIZE|c}} or <code>[[Item_definition_token|[SIZE]]]</code> in the [[raw file]]s.

Size has many important effects on the game, many through its direct effect on item [[weight]], but as [[material science|material properties]] go, its implementation is sometimes underwhelming - witness the incredible compression of matter, space, and time that is the [[QSP]]. When even multiple full grown [[dragon]]s occupy a single square, size becomes a little difficult to contextualize. It doesn't help that a [[bronze colossus]] fits in a basic [[wood]]en [[cage]] (although, so does a [[fire man]].

Size directly affects such things as [[Weapon#Size|which weapons]] your dwarves can equip, [[butcher]]ing returns, [[storage]] limits, and [[combat]] effectiveness for both creatures and weapons.

Size is used to calculate an item's weight, along with the [[density]] of the underlying material(s):
:Weight (in Γ) = Density (in kg/m<sup>3</sup>) * Size (in cm<sup>3</sup>) / 1,000,000 (cm<sup>3</sup> in a m<sup>3</sup>)

Through weight, the size of an item has further ramifications in the game, such as [[hauling]] speed, [[pressure plate]] activation, impact momentum, weight restrictions, and so forth. 

The weight of creatures is calculated from the densities and sizes of the layers of their body parts, which currently results in corpse weights that are about 1/3 heavier than expected.

Internally, all custom size numbers are rounded down to the nearest multiple of 10 - thus, if you define an item with <code>[SIZE:15]</code>, it will actually behave as if you had specified <code>[SIZE:10]</code>.{{cite forum|169696.msg8300987#msg8300987}}

== Buildings ==
The {{token|DIM|building}} [[building token]] defines the size of a [[workshop]] or [[building]] in [[tile]]s. This differs from creatures and items in that a building doesn't have a weight, and it's not in cm³, of course.

== Creatures ==
When it comes to creatures, size is a rough stand-in for [[weight]] since standard flesh weighs about one gram per cubic centimeter. However, in the typical complexity of ''Dwarf Fortress'', there are a number of ''other'' [[material]]s animals can include ([[ivory]], [[hair]], [[horn]], [[shell]], etc.) which have their own densities, shifting a creature's actual weight relative to its size, sometimes significantly (elephant tusks weigh a ''lot''). Creature size is determined by {{token|BODY_SIZE|c}} tokens, often with multiple tokens to set their base size at certain ages.

Bodysize determines several things:
* Average [[butcher]]ing yields.
* How much [[damage]] they can absorb (along with morphology).
* How much damage they can inflict in melee (along with morphology and attack definition [[creature token|token]]s).
* For creatures that can wear equipment ({{token|EQUIPS|c}}).
:* What size of equipment a creature can wear; clothing and armor are sized for a specific species and only creatures with a species base size near that size can wear them, an individual creature's actual size does not matter for this.
:* Weapons have a minimum size that a creature must be to wield them ({{token|MINIMUM_SIZE|wp}} and {{token|TWO_HANDED|wp}}), tissue layer thickness not included, see below.

The actual size of an individual creature is the result of different effects:
* The base BODY_SIZE for the species of creature.
* The [[age]] of the creature; most creatures are born at minimum size and grow to a maximum.
:* Some, like dragons and most species of snake, grow throughout their entire lifetime and may not live long enough to reach the maximum.
* Inheritance; many creatures have {{token|BODY_APPEARANCE_MODIFIER|c}}) tokens that allow them to vary in height, width, or length, which they can maybe [[Genetics|pass on]] to children.
The following add to size, but are not included when determining how weapons are wielded.
* Muscle mass, determined by its [[strength]] attribute (a thin dwarf with ~44210 size will be ~64210 once they become unbelievably strong), due to muscle having {{token|THICKENS_ON_STRENGTH|tissue}}.
* Fat mass, due to {{token|THICKENS_ON_ENERGY_STORAGE|tissue}}.{{verify|untested, seems like it should, and a bug if it doesn't}}

Creature sizes range from 1 (small insect [[vermin]]) to 200,000,000 ([[giant sperm whale]]s, the largest creature in the game). See [[List of creatures by adult size]] for details.

== Items ==
Most items defined in the [[raws]] require a <code>[SIZE]</code> token, each class of item has its own: for instance, {{token|SIZE|ammo}} for [[ammo]], {{token|SIZE|wp}} for [[weapon]]s, {{token|SIZE|tool}} for [[tool token|tool]]s, and so on.

Item types not defined in the raws also have a size which can be determined from their weight and material density, using DFHack, or code debugging. Some assorted item type sizes, and their [[storage]] capacity when applicable:
