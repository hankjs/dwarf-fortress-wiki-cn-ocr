'''Giant horseshoe crabs''' are 100 times the size of regular [[horseshoe crab]]s, making them slightly larger than a [[llama]]. Giant horseshoe crabs are [[amphibious]] creatures found in [[ocean]] [[biome]]s, and are normally non-threatening. Theoretically, giant horseshoe crabs could appear as [[mount]]s during a [[siege]], however no ocean-inhabiting civilization exists to ride them into battle.

Giant horseshoe crabs can be [[animal trainer|tamed]] as exotic pets, though their pet value is the same as most other giant creatures. Some dwarves [[preference|prefer]] giant horseshoe crabs for their ability to hide in sand.

Unlike their smaller cousins, giant horseshoe crabs make for poor training partners in [[adventure mode]], being too flimsy to last long as punching bags, too large for an unskilled wrestler to restrain, and massive enough that their pushes will crush limbs and mangle joints if they connect.
