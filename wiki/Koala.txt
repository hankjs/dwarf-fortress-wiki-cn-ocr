'''Koalas''' are solitary [[Creature|animals]] who inhabit [[temperate]] broadleaf [[forest]]s. Small in size, being only twice the size of a [[cat]], they are benign meanderers who do little but roam around aimlessly, fleeing from any attempts of interaction, which makes them very easy prey for your [[Dwarf|dwarven]] [[hunter]]s. An infant koala is called a ''joey'', and they are born with Legendary [[skill]] in [[Climber|climbing]].

Koalas can be captured in [[cage]] [[trap]]s and [[Animal trainer|trained]] into exotic [[pet]]s; but give fairly low returns when [[butcher]]ed, less than something more easily accessible like a [[dog]], making them poor targets for a [[meat industry]].

Some dwarves [[Preferences|like]] koalas for their ''adorable appearance''.

{{D for Dwarf}}
Despite popular belief, koalas are not bears. [[Grizzly bear man|Grizzly bear men]] are offended by such remarks and would kindly request all dwarves to stop.

What they truly are, however, is danger incarnate, lurking on the trees and dropping down on your head to bite you to death. At least according to the humans, and surely they wouldn't lie about such things.
