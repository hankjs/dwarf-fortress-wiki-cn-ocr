'''Pineapple opals''' are moderately valuable [[gem]]s that can be found just about anywhere.
==In Real Life==
Opal "pineapples" are highly unusual opal pseudomorphs. They are formed after a large glauberite crystal dissolves into nothing and leaves behind a crystal-shaped hole. When this "cast" is filled by slowly-depositing calcite which then opalizes, the result is a roughly egg-shaped spike ball of precious opal. They're only found in Australia's White Cliffs, which has yielded specimens as large as an adult fist. They can be (and previously were) cut into standard cabochon shapes, but their uniqueness has since been recognized and prized.

And as you guessed, they don't taste like [[pineapple]]s.
