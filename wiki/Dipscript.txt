A '''dipscript''', or "diplomat script", is what controlled the behavior of visiting [[diplomat]]s when they met with your [[noble]]s in previous versions of Dwarf Fortress. As of 50.01, this functionality has been embedded in the executable and is no longer user-modifiable.

For how dipscripts were structured in previous versions of the game, see [[DF2014:Dipscript]].
