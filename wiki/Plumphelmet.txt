'''Plump helmets''' are the most basic, resilient, and versatile of the six underground [[crop|plant]]s for [[Dwarf|dwarves]] to [[grower|grow]]. They appear as large mushrooms with a purple cap, and have burgundy-colored spores. They are one of the fastest growing plants and can be [[cooking|cooked]], [[brewing|brewed]] into dwarven wine, and even eaten raw. They require an underground [[farm plot]], which requires [[soil]] or muddy ground. They are the only plant food-item that can be purchased at [[embark]].

Keep in mind that [[cooking]] plants destroys their [[seed]]s, or in this case their "spawn". Both eating a plant raw and brewing it will leave plump helmet spawn behind, which can then be transferred to a seed [[bag]], then planted and used to grow more. New players should definitely [[Farming|farm]] this crop because it grows relatively quickly, can be planted in any season, may be used to make alcohol, or eaten raw if need be.

If you grow nothing but plump helmets over a large area, your fort may start drowning in plump helmets, a truly ''terrible'' condition wherein barrels upon barrels are needed to hold back the waves of purple mushrooms. There are two ways to combat this - firstly, start cooking them into meals, the fancier the better. These produce no spawn, and thus put a dent in the population. This will also level up a cook and produce happy [[thought]]s in your dwarves. Secondly, rotate your crops to include such things as [[pig tail]] (to bootstrap a [[textile industry]]) or [[cave wheat]] (to provide some variety in the diet).

[[Plump helmet man|Plump helmet men]] are humanoid, intelligent versions of these plants.

Some dwarves [[Preferences|like]] plump helmets for their ''rounded tops''.
