Site-level nobles, such as the [[Mayor]], are '''elected''' for one year. Elections take place at exactly 4:00 PM on the 17th day of summer (specifically, 20000 season-ticks after the beginning of the season). If you don't have a this position-slot filled, then the election will happen at the beginning of every season, rather than just summer.{{Verify}} If an election doesn't trigger after gaining the minimum amount of dwarves needed for whatever reason, assigning the previous position as "leave vacant" will force an election.

When an election happens, it's usually the dwarf with the highest social skills who gets elected. In previous versions [[children]] had nothing to do but socialize, and did, therefore, gain lots of social skill, which carries over when a child becomes an adult at age 18 and therefore an 18-year-old mayor was not a rare sight. But in the current version, children prefer playing over socializing, and thus will only rarely become a mayor (with the possible exception of migrant children, who already had high social skill on arrival, and unhappy children constantly complaining). Prime candidates for mayor are [[vampire]]s (who tend to have high social skills, if they have been around for a long time), tamed [[gremlin]]s, and other non-working citizens of your fortress, since they cannot be put to work either. Any citizen can be elected.

For responsibilities or positions that use more than one skill, no skill takes priority in electing a creature: an accomplished comedian is more qualified for the TRADE responsibility than a skilled appraiser. In fact the sum of skill levels (uncapped) of all relevant skills (for that position) are compared and whoever has the highest sum gets the position. A creature may be elected to multiple positions at the same time.

==Civilization nobles==
If noble positions at civ-level are created by modding, they can also be [[Position_token#ELECTED]]. In worldgen, there is no functional difference between ELECTED and no appointment rule except that ELECTED nobles tend to have high social skills and/or skills related to the position, while non-elected ones are assigned randomly. They are not re-elected after a certain period of time. This means that they stay in this position for life and their successor will be elected again.
