{{DISPLAYTITLE:Legacy of ''Dwarf Fortress''}}

'''''Dwarf Fortress''''' has made an impact on contemporary culture and society.

The game influenced ''Minecraft'', which reviewers considered a more user-friendly version of ''Dwarf Fortress''. Adams says he is thankful for the ''Minecraft'' developers citing his game because that drew more players. There have been other games inspired by the game but they failed to replicate its visual style and depth. Homages to the game appear in the ''[[wikipedia: World of Warcraft|World of Warcraft]]''. In July 2014, the game won a poll conducted by [[wikipedia: Turtle Beach Systems|Turtle Beach]] as the community's most "Beautiful Game"; games were nominated by fans posting videos, images or text, and a list was compiled by the community which also contained ''[[wikipedia: The Legend of Zelda: The Wind Waker|The Legend of Zelda: The Wind Waker]]'', ''[[wikipedia: Far Cry 3|Far Cry 3]]'' and ''[[wikipedia: The Last of Us|The Last of Us]]''. Justin Ma, one of the developers of ''[[wikipedia: FTL: Faster Than Light|FTL: Faster Than Light]]'', commented on its use of text-based graphics, "Part of the reason ''Dwarf Fortress'' can include a breadth of mechanics unseen in other games is because complex mechanics are expressed in the most simple of visual forms." [[wikipedia: Gaslamp Games|Gaslamp Games]] cited it as one their main influences for the game ''[[wikipedia: Clockwork Empires|Clockwork Empires]]''.

In March 2013, the [[wikipedia: Museum of Modern Art|Museum of Modern Art]] in New York City exhibited ''Dwarf Fortress'' [[wikipedia: List of works in the Museum of Modern Art#Video games|among other games selected]] to depict the history of video gaming. As new updates are made available, the Museum of Modern Art instantly downloads them and archives them in their secure server. Curator of the exhibition, [[wikipedia: Paola Antonelli|Paola Antonelli]], said she was amazed by the combination of "beautiful aesthetics" and "mind-boggling" complexity in the game.

Game designer Craig Ellsworth commended ''Dwarf Fortress'' for having a uniquely long "staying power". According to Ellsworth, it will not be replaced by any other more advanced game of its genre, partly because of it being the pioneer of its own and since it is on PC; console games get replaced faster. He wrote, "There is simply no such thing as a flashier ''Dwarf Fortress'', and there can't be, by definition." Other reasons, according to him, were it being free and its long development period with its design to be "never-ending". He wrote that the game will have its maximum interest at its 1.0 version with its legacy being more than just a historic value compared to other classic games. He pointed out that people like the game in its present condition; they will continue playing it more ardently, as long as it keeps developing, especially with new additions and features. He compared it to the board game ''[[wikipedia: Monopoly (game)|Monopoly]]'' and the card game ''[[wikipedia: Magic: The Gathering|Magic: The Gathering]]''. Ellsworth finally said that the game is either a "one-time fluke" or will inspire "a rise of ultra-small indies" with similar financial setups.
