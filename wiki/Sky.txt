:''You may be looking for [[open space]]. Sky is open space (and appears as open space when loo{{k|k}}ed at), but cannot exist underground.''

'''Sky''' is represented by a mass of solid blue (cyan) [[:Category:Map tiles|tiles]] across the map. Sky only appears if there are two levels of successive open space below the current view, ''and'' there are no floors or constructions above the current view. A tile that has direct, vertical access to the sky (above the tile) is classified as [[outside]] (as opposed to [[inside]]). "Outside" tiles can cause sickness and [[vomit]]ing in [[cave adaptation|cave-adapted]] [[dwarves]].

:"''Sky allows horrible [[light]] to filter into outposts, and should be avoided at all costs.''" --Zulgar Zarethadil, [[Miner]]
