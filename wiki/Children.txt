Most [[creature]]s, including [[dwarf|dwarves]], start out as infants, then after a certain number of years become '''children''', and after that become adults - for dwarves, childhood starts after reaching one year of age, and continues until age 18. 

In fortress mode, some migrant dwarves are [[marriage|married]] and may bring children. Children who immigrate to your [[fortress]] might be any age from one to 17. You can determine the age of any child by viewing their [[thoughts and preferences|thoughts]] screen, which will give you the child's exact age as well as their date of birth. This information is visible regardless of whether or not the child was born in your fortress.

"Resident" heterosexually [[marriage|married]] female dwarves may also give birth to children. Dwarves can even have [[miscarriage]]s (if they become dehydrated, starving, or are subjected to certain types of physical trauma), which causes an unhappy thought for the mother, but not for the father.

Much of [[goblin]] society is centered around [[thief|stealing the children]] of other races. The appropriate response to a baby-snatcher appearing on the map is the judicious use of [[magma|dwarven diplomacy]].

Humanoid creatures (the five main species) that are children or babies will appear as unique smaller sprites, and will appear to be wearing red if the option to show worn clothing dyes is disabled. Young animals and other creatures will have a smaller sprite than their adult counterparts, with some of them having baby sprites as well. Curiously enough, portraits can still show dwarven children with facial hair.

==Babies==
[[File:dwarf_children.jpg|thumb|260px|right|Before they grow up to realize they're in an unwinnable game.<br><small>''Art by Devilingo''</small>]][[File:df_baby_list.png|thumb|260px|right|Many children and a baby seen in the citizen information menu.]][[File:dwarf_child_portrait.png|thumb|96px|right|Portrait of a dwarven child.]]Babies do not have to be born in [[bed]]s, but are born wherever the mother happens to be, which will interrupt most current actions of the mother. The game will play the birth sound effect and [[announcement|announce]] the arrival of the baby. The mother will cancel whatever task she was in the middle of to seek her infant, and then will ''usually'' resume whatever task she was doing before the child was born.  Dwarven mothers can also give birth to twins or triplets, although that is exceedingly rare (1 out of 500), due to their [MULTIPLE_LITTER_RARE] token. Babies are looked after by their mother, who will continue working while carrying the babies.

[[Unconscious]] mothers will not wake up when they give birth – [[sleep]]ing and resting in a [[hospital]] will not be interrupted. Dwarves in a [[strange mood]] will also not interrupt their mood when giving birth – cancelling a mood forces instant insanity, so it is likely a coding choice to protect mothers (and children). Imprisoned mothers can grab their child if they give birth while on a chain, but cannot retrieve an infant that is out of their reach, which can cause massive problems, since a mother carrying a child is forced to drop it before being brought to prison. Most jobs performed by a mother upon giving birth will be immediatly cancelled to pick up the baby, but for instance a current haul animal job, where the mother is already leading the animal, will not be cancelled, but will be finished before the infant is picked up.

If the mother is sleeping or otherwise prevented from collecting her infant, the baby will be free to roam as it pleases. An emancipated baby acts in a similar manner to a [[insanity|raving mad]] adult, wandering freely over the map without any sense of self-preservation, gravitating to [[Activity_zone#Meeting_area|meeting zone]]s. It may be fed and watered by other dwarves, and in recent versions, such care happens regularly enough to keep orphans alive. As long as a baby is not within reach of a hostile creature, no harm will be done to it. "Job cancellation spam" can be generated as the baby is seen by the game to be "insane" (example: "Urist McBabyname, Dwarven baby, cancels Clean Self: Too Insane"), but once it reaches childhood (at 12 months), that will stop, and they go about their business like any other dwarven child. While dwarven children are dressed in red, a baby's clothes will be dark yellow.

The sex of a baby is determined upon birth; this means that [[Cheating#Savescumming|reloading a save]] before a baby's birth might get a baby of the other sex. After giving birth, it is possible for the mother to become pregnant again immediately, and give birth to another child nine months later.

Babies will crawl to burrows when assigned to them.

Any baby being carried by its mother will effectively leech [[food]] and [[Thirst|drink]] from her, causing her to become hungry or thirsty at double the usual rate. This does not, however, count as alcohol consumption – when a baby is close to 1 year old, it will have severe withdrawal.

Babies can gain memories, although it seems that only thoughts with strong emotions can become the memory of a baby. Many thoughts (with strong emotions), which can become a memory, are able to change the dwarf's values/facets (upon becoming a core memory). And since babies (and small children) will, if any, only have few memories, such memories will have a tremendous effect on the dwarf's happiness (as they will continuesly remember the same few memories). Most of the thoughts with strong emotions (in a baby) are negative thoughts and only a few are positive. Of the negative thoughts observed to become memories, aside from the (negative) ones known to be able to change the dwarf's values facets, is being pestered by vermin (but this thought does rarely become a memory, but being aggrevated by vermin might be another matter as vermin generating such thoughts are hated by the dwarven baby). On the positive side, aside from gaining a sibling (which will usually change the dwarf's values/facets later on), being "near to a favorite (caged) creature" can become a memory (and presumly also being near to a waterfall {{verify}}). All of this means that it is not advised to let a baby-carrying mother (and thus the baby) be caught in the rain. But it might be a good idea to let the baby-carrying mother walk by a cage containing a favorite creature of the baby, as babies getting such a positive memory might be "fine" upon becoming a child (and not merely content or even unhappy). Also, babies can gain knowledge of dance, music and poetry forms by watching performances, although they supposedly cannot gain any other skills (except when eg. taken on a raid mission by their mother).

The first order of business when a baby becomes a child is to pick up their clothing. After finishing that task, the child will start to play in the tile they picked up their last piece of clothing (although they might fetch a toy beforehand). This behaviour, by proper stockpile placement (and stockpile links) and having enough mittens/cloaks/hoods, can be exploited, so that the former dwarven baby will always play in a guildhall after becoming a child.

==Labor==
In [[fortress mode]], children can be assigned the relatively minor labors designated chores, below, but will also perform a few simple tasks on their own, such as:

* Socializing in [[location]]s, also holding [[performance]]s like singing, or reciting poetry (and they can gain skill levels in dancing, poetry and musical instruments). But children can perform music that they know anywhere and everywhere (especially if it only requires one performer), they are not bound by meeting places or locations, but instead start singing in a bedroom or stockpile instead. But performing seems to be currently gated, ie. only children, that have a musician and/or singing skill, will perform music, which means that children born in the current fortress will not display that behaviour, but "void" dwarf children (migrants) can as they can be created with such performance skills.
* Picking out, and wearing, their own [[clothing]].
* Watching (and even leading) guild demonstrations, provided the guild is open to all citizens.
* Attending meetings to complain to someone in charge, if unhappy (ie. as a 1 year old due to being caught in the rain as a baby).
* Eating, drinking, and sleeping as necessary.
* [[Farming|Harvesting]] [[crops]], if the "All dwarves harvest" [[standing orders|order]] is on. This will also increase their [[planter]] skill, which only happens very sporadically in the current version.
* When they want to, storing their items, including toys (specifically, they may perform a Store Item in Bin order for multiple toys).
* Children can play with [[toy]]s, such as puzzle boxes or toy axes, and might also play make believe. Both are basically filler jobs without tangible benefits, except for usually giving the child a happy thought and so unstressing the child (although some children might not feel anything instead).
* Fighting or running from hostiles, depending on circumstances. (Since children are small, can't use armor or weapons, and all start without combat skills, don't expect them to be effective fighters. Nor, for that matter, can they be assigned to squads.)
* Children can enter [[strange mood]]s, going about them the same as an adult dwarf. If they did not watch any guild demonstrations in a moodable skill (prior to the strange mood), they will attempt to make one artifact appropriate for a [[bone carver]], [[wood crafter]], or [[stonecrafter]], otherwise they will create an artifact according to the highest moodable skill (normal strange mood rules apply). They will also gain experience as normal if they complete it, except for possessed moods.
* Children respect [[burrow]] restrictions, including civilian alerts.
* Attempting to [[swim]] if submerged in [[water]].

Children may not be assigned to the [[noble|nobility]] and cannot join any guild (even if legendary in one of the required skills). However, they ''can'' be assigned bedrooms - even though children might still choose to sleep in their parents' bedroom instead of their own. If no tasks are available, they will gladly loiter in meeting areas, like [[dining room]]s for example, for the duration of their youth. Children born in the fort tend to follow their mother by preference, even (especially?) if their mother is a soldier and is currently going into battle.

Children are also known to be invisible to [[vampire]]s, thus making excellent crime detectors, as they speak truthfully in all cases.

The game will create an [[announcement]] when children reach adulthood, and can be assigned labors. This announcement will not pause and/or center the screen by default.

==Chores==
There is a chores tab under Labor/Standing Orders that allows players to disable/enable the chore tasks, which are:

* [[Feed patients/prisoners]]
* [[Milking]]
* [[Stone hauling]]
* [[Wood hauling]]
* [[Item hauling]]
* [[Burial]]
* [[Food hauling]]
* [[Refuse hauling]]
* [[Furniture hauling]]
* [[Animal hauling]]
* [[Trade good hauling]]
* [[Water hauling]]
* [[Cleaning]]
* [[Lever operation]]

Children don't seem to like chores, resulting in them becoming depressed and moody, which can result, obviously, in the children committing various crimes. Turning off chores will help alleviate this issue - you must decide for yourself if the increased mood is worth the loss of their labor.

Consider turning off Refuse Hauling and Burial as well; children tend to accumulate bad thoughts when hauling corpses, which can stress them out even more than it does adults. Also, children tend to start playing immediately after finishing a task, so if you leave Refuse Hauling on, they may decide that the corpse pile is an excellent playground, adding to the problem.

Furthermore, do not expect children who are younger than 12 years to be as good at hauling as their adult counterparts with similar physical attributes, as they are smaller and size does matter when it comes to hauling.  It is even worse for children before they are at least one year & 168 days old (528 days total), as this is another size cut point.

==Dwarven parenthood==

In the eighth [http://www.bay12games.com/dwarves/df_talk.html DFTalk], it was mentioned that, due to a programming oversight, children's parents can become so preoccupied with finding their children that they can die of thirst.

==Too many children==
If there are too many children in the fort, [[FPS]] may suffer. [[Unfortunate accident|Removing]] children is difficult, as doing so may quickly lead to [[stress]]. One possibility is to [[burrow]] children outside to aid [[thief|snatchers]]. To prevent a large population of children in the first place, it is preferred to set the child and/or strict population capacities in the [[Settings#Population_and_seed_capacities|settings]].

In longer-running forts, when a parent has more than 10 children of one gender, the 11th onward will merely be referred to as "son" or "daughter". The exception to this is that the youngest will always be referred to as "youngest son" or "youngest daughter".

==Non-dwarven children==
[[Human]]s, goblins, [[Elf|elves]], [[kobold]]s and subterranean [[animal people]] follow the same aging progress of dwarves (born as babies, becoming children at a year old then become adults at eighteen). The same is true for some races of wild humanoid creatures and [[semi-megabeast]]s, though some possess shorter or longer child states than dwarves do, e.g. [[troll]]s become adults at the age of 10. Regardless of how long their child states are, intelligent non-dwarf children are functionally identical to their dwarven counterparts for gameplay purposes.

Young animals possess limited capabilities compared to their adult stages. Infant [[milk]]-bearing livestock can't be milked, young [[wool]]-bearing animals can't be [[shear]]ed, and bird and reptile hatchlings are unable to lay [[egg]]s. However, unlike intelligent creatures, almost all animals follow a different aging progress; they skip the baby stage entirely and are born as children, who become adults at only 1 year of age (though they usually don't stop growing in size until the age of 2). Certain exceptions exist, however, such as [[elephant]]s, who take 10 years to reach adulthood. Savage [[animal people]] versions of these animals follow this same aging progress.

Certain creatures possess no child state to speak of, and are technically adults at birth, having all the capabilities of an adult immediately after starting existing (though most of them are still subject to growing in size as they get older). These creatures include stuff like all species of snakes, [[crundle]]s, [[giant cave spider]]s, [[creeping eye]]s, [[magma crab]]s and most [[megabeast]]s. Inorganic creatures such as [[Gabbro man|gabbro men]], [[Fire man|fire men]] and [[Amethyst man|amethyst men]] also exist only as adults and never as children. If the creature born as an adult is an intelligent creature, they'll be born with generally mild levels in some skills.

Creatures capable of being [[invader]]s can do so regardless of age - as such, you may be attacked by a [[werebeast]] child, or a young [[roc]], [[giant]], [[cyclops]], [[ettin]] or [[minotaur]]. They will behave exactly like their adult counterparts, but will generally be easier to kill than adults due to their smaller size. Such cases are rare, as they require either children being infected by a werebeast and not dying in the process, or for megabeasts to breed, both being particularly uncommon occurrences.

If the mother of a child is not a historical figure (on birth of the child) the game will not keep track of the family relationship between parent and offspring. The game will also not keep track of offspring of male historical figures, unless the mother is already a historical figure at the time the fertilization of the not yet laid eggs (in case of egg-layers) resp. at the time the pregnancy starts (non egg-layers).
<!-- ==Bugs==
Dwarf babies can sometimes have an age that is negative (''most commonly, -1'') or zero. In this case, they will appear headless.{{verify|Is there an open bug on dwarffortress.mantishub.io?}} -->
