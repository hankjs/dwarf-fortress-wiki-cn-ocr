'''Monk''' is a profession for some inhabitants of generated [[site]]s, like [[town]]s. Some monks show up as [[visitor]]s in Fortress mode, and [[agent]]s sometimes try to pose as monks. Monks are recruited into [[religion|monastic orders]], and when there are enough monks in an order; they will build a [[monastery]]. Monks are [[Unit_type_token#MONK|shown in white]].

In adventure mode, you will occasionally see monks passing by when walking through a [[human]] [[hamlet]]. Following these monks will eventually lead to finding them standing stock-still in the middle of a field, unmoving, but still willing to talk to you.

==Fortress mode==

Monks will not [[immigration|migrate]] to your fortress in this version.
