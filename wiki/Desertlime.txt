'''Desert lime''' is one of the many genera of [[tree]]s found above ground. Like the vast majority of above ground trees, desert lime [[wood]] is brown and produces brown products.

It does not actually grow in [[desert]]s.

Some [[Dwarf|dwarves]] [[Preferences|like]] desert lime trees for their ''fruit''.
