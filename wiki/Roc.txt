[[File:Roc_Size.png|frame|Estimated size comparison between a roc and a dwarf.]]

'''Rocs''' are gigantic [[megabeast]]s taking the form of colossal birds of prey. These [[creature]]s reach their max size at only 20 years, and once they hit that age, they become the [[List of creatures by adult size#end of list|largest creatures]] in the game who are capable of flight. As megabeasts, rocs are also found in lairs, stealing items from nearby [[site]]s and generally harassing [[civilization]]s. Their lair is often littered with the loot they've amassed, as well as a number of [[nest box]]es for them to use. All rocs are born with Talented [[skill]] in [[Combat skill|fighting, biting, kicking, dodging]] and [[Observer|observing]].

Rocs are naturally formidable opponents; they are twice the size of a [[titan]] and are able to attack your [[dwarves]] from above, quickly turning them into little bearded shreds with their talons. However, when compared to their fellow megabeasts, rocs are arguably the least powerful of the four. Unlike other megabeasts, rocs are susceptible to both pain and over-exertion, and they also lack the danger posed by the [[Dragonfire|fire breath]] of a [[dragon]], the multi-attacks of a [[hydra]] or the inorganic armor of a [[bronze colossus]]. That being said, rocs are not to be underestimated, for their sheer size makes them a grave threat to a fortress.

Despite their monstrous size, rocs are just as vulnerable to [[cage]] [[trap]]s as any other creature. In the event the player succeeds in capturing one, they can be [[Animal trainer|trained]] and turned into war or hunting beasts or, if female, be [[pasture]]d at a [[nest box]] to lay gigantic [[egg]]s – rocs lay the largest eggs in the game, each over thrice the size of a dwarf, but egg size currently plays no role. Rocs only lay 1-2 eggs at a time, which would make them subpar targets for [[egg production]] along with the size of them making hauling the eggs a time-consuming process, though one may choose to ignore this fact for the bragging rights of having your dwarves dine on the eggs of a colossal mythical bird. 

Along with dragons, rocs are one of the megabeasts in possession of the {{token|CHILD|c}} token, meaning they can become fully domesticated without [[modding]]. (Outdated: However, due to being megabeasts, rocs are perpetually hostile to your military [[squad]]s and must be kept separated from your soldiers, otherwise they will kill each other on sight.{{bug|10731}}) This is almost certainly outdated information according to [https://www.reddit.com/r/dwarffortress/comments/111mnh1/tame_dragon_not_attacking_military/ this] Reddit post. Trained or tame rocs likely won't attack friendly creatures, even if they're military, guests etc. 

Some dwarves [[Preferences|like]] rocs for their ''awe-inspiring size'' and their ''dedication to their young''.
