'''Badger men''' are [[animal people]] variants of the common [[badger]] who inhabit [[savage]] [[temperate]] [[forest]]s and [[taiga]]s. They spawn in groups of anywhere between 5-10 individuals and retain the original animal's bad temper, occasionally going into a fit of rage and attacking nearby creatures. In terms of size, they are over half the weight of the average [[dwarf]], and as such can cause significant damage in a confrontation with an unarmed civilian or pet.

Like other savage animal people, badger men can join [[civilization]]s, become historical figures, appear as [[visitor]]s and be playable in [[adventurer mode]].

Some dwarves [[Preferences|like]] badger men for their ''underground communities'' and their ''striped faces''.

{{D for Dwarf}}
It is well known that badger men prefer [[wall]]s made from red materials.
