'''Giant emus''' are very large creatures - between an [[alligator]] and a bull [[moose]] in size. They'll wander around your fortress [[surroundings]] in groups of 2-10, and produce a very sizeable amount of [[meat]] when [[butcher]]ed. If you manage to capture a breeding pair, you can make use of a trifecta of properties of the species: excellent butchery returns, excellent [[egg production]], and excellent [[pet|pet value]]. Capturing and breeding giant emus is a win-win-win situation, leading to a very profitable [[catsplosion|birdsplosion]].

Some dwarves [[Preferences|like]] giant emus for their ''size'' and their ''inquisitive nature''.
