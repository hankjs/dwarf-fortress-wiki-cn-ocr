When adding creatures, please make sure that you:

* sort creatures alphabetically
* be consistent with how the other creature's information is displayed
* try to avoid including periods in any part of the table
* keep "notes" short, and only include if they're distinctive
* and use preview to make sure you got it all right!

Thanks!
