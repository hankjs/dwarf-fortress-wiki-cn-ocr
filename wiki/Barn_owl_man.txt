'''Barn owl men''' are humanoid versions of the common [[barn owl]] and a [[Creature|species]] of unremarkable [[animal people]], found in a wide variety of [[savage]] [[biome]]s. They are a little over half the size of an adult [[dwarf]] and spawn in groups of 5-10 individuals, who are unlikely to pose any danger to your fortress unless provoked. All barn owl men are born with Legendary [[skill]] in [[Climber|climbing]].

Like other savage animal people, barn owl men may occasionally join [[civilization]]s, becoming full-fledged citizens who may appear in your fortress as [[visitor]]s or be playable in [[adventurer mode]].

Some dwarves [[Preferences|like]] barn owl men for their ''coloration''.

Despite some myths and tales told by humans to their young, barn owl men have not been observed to be any wiser than other creatures, though their natural attraction to museums and scholarly careers may lead one to believe such a thing is true, especially when said owls blather on incessantly about whatever artifact is brought up in a conversation.
