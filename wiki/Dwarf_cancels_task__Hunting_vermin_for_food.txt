{{DFtext|Dwarf cancels task: Hunting vermin for food.}}

If you see this message, or a dwarf with the "Hunt for small creature" job, the dwarf can't find any [[food]].

A dwarf may not be able to find any food because:
# There is no more food for any dwarf. (Did you bring enough on embark? Did you trade for enough from the [[trader]]s? Did you cook all your edible [[seed]]s?)
# This dwarf is hungry, but is blocked from accessing the food stores. (Is a door locked? Is there flooding? Did an underground tree grow across a path? Did you mine out any stairs or ramps you shouldn't have?)

See [[starvation]] for more details.
