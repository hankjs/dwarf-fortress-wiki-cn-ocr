'''Giant polar bears''' are colossal predators that can be found in [[savage]] [[tundra]]s and [[glacier]]s. Like normal [[polar bear]]s, they will attempt to steal [[food]] and [[alcohol]] from stockpiles. A lone [[dwarf]], especially a civilian, stands little chance of stopping a giant polar bear.

Some dwarves [[Preference|like]] giant polar bears for their ''strength''.
