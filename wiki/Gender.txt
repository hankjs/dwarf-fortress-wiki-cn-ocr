[[File:gender_symbols.png|right]]'''Gender''' (along with [[orientation]]), determines if two creatures can [[breed]]. Gender may also influence the size, attacks, or other characteristics of very dimorphic creatures (e.g. [[elephant seal]], [[moose]]) - for instance, female [[giant mosquito]]s alone can suck blood from other creatures. On the other hand, intelligent species are generally not very dimorphic. For instance, the only difference between male and female dwarves - apart from breeding ability - is the presence of a [[beard]]. This means that, apart from the occasional (and infamous) soldier giving birth mid-fight, the player can pretty much treat male and female citizens interchangeably. (A notable exception is [[animal people]], whose dimorphism (and other attributes) reflect that of the animal they're sourced from.)

If a creature is genderless, or if the gender is unknown, the game will simply refer to that creature as "it".

==Determining gender==
When {{k|v}}iewing a unit, a symbol appears below its name:
{| class="wikitable"|-
! Gender
! Symbol
! Common names
! Other uses|-| '''Male'''| {{DFtext|{{char|11}}}}| Boar| [[Bag]]s|-| '''Female'''| {{DFtext|{{char|12}}}}| Sow| [[Finished goods#Crafts|Amulets]]|}

Clicking on the creature will bring up an informative character sheet, where the creature's gender (or lack thereof) can be seen.

A [[Gelding|gelded]] male's gender will appear as {{DFtext|x{{char|11}}x}}. 

If mods give a female a body part marked [[Body token#Geldable|GELDABLE]] then, when "[[Gelding|gelded]]" that creature will display the gender {{DFtext|x{{char|12}}x}}.

==Raws==
In the [[raws]], genders are defined using generalized [[caste]] tokens (not to be confused with [[cast]]s). Castes are often just defined as "male" or "female", but there are a few [[antman|notable exceptions]].

==Trivia==
*Transgender dwarves were confirmed to be a planned future feature [https://twitter.com/Bay12Games/status/1107118932077346817 on the Bay 12 Games twitter in March 2019]. Intersex dwarves were confirmed in the same tweet.
*There is no symbol in the game for creatures without gender, nor unknown genders. In real life, the symbol for being genderless is "⚲" or "∅", while the symbol for unknown genders is "△".
*A common way to implement a kind of sterility for a creature is to make it one-gendered. In vanilla, this is the case for [[mule]]s, which are male-only in-game. As such, they effectively can't reproduce.
