'''Sea serpents''' are gigantic [[aquatic]] [[Creature|predators]] who inhabit [[savage]] [[ocean]]s. Purely aquatic creatures, sea serpents will not leave water to attack your [[Dwarf|dwarves]], but any dwarf that foolishly falls in will not have long to live. At 9,000,000 cm³, they're one of the largest creatures found in the sea. Sea serpents can appear in any savage ocean, but have a population limit of one per [[biome]] - so if you want more than one to appear, you'll need an embark where two different ocean biomes overlap. They can have children, but will only lay one [[egg]] at a time. Young sea serpents become adults at the [[age]] of six, but do not reach their full size until they are twenty years old. They have an extremely long (for a non-sapient creature) lifespan, living to be 150 to 170 years old - the same as dwarves.

Sea serpents have been [http://www.bay12forums.com/smf/index.php?topic=75780.0 discussed] as a replacement for [[merperson|merfolk]] in aquatic farming operations due to their high body part multiplier as well as their massive size. Unfortunately, they cannot currently [[breed]] due to a bug with submerged [[nest box]]es.{{bug|4105}} While described as limbless (and being depicted as such in their Premium graphical sprite), they in fact possess both front and rear flippers, which presumably makes them resemble some sort of draconic plesiosaurus.

Some dwarves [[Preferences|like]] sea serpents for their ''majesty''.
