'''Elephant men''' are the humanoid versions of [[elephant]]s, found in [[savage]] [[tropical]] [[forest]]s and [[shrubland]]s. They are the largest of the land-dwelling [[animal people]] and are joint second in size (along with [[orca man|orca men]]) only to the [[aquatic]] [[sperm whale man|sperm whale men]]. However, they are smaller than some other land-dwelling humanoids such as [[giant]]s and [[cyclops|cyclopes]]. 

As with other intelligent wilderness creatures, players can play as elephant men in [[adventurer mode]]. Their immense size makes them especially effective in [[combat]]. They also have a significantly larger carrying capacity than other adventurers, allowing them to easily carry many items around without slowing down.

In combat, elephant men's size makes it easy for them to break the grip of wrestlers and the impact from jumping into an opponent can easily send the unfortunate soul flying an average distance of seven tiles with no obstacles present. This is particularly useful when it is successfully performed to gain the initiative due to the likelihood that they will slam into a tree, wall, or other impassable obstacle, dealing additional damage and potentially incapacitating them long enough to get within melee range. Like elephants, the elephant man also has two tusks with which to gore enemies, which can be exceedingly useful should the player lodge their weapon in an agile enemy (most flying creatures).

Some [[dwarves]] [[Preferences|like]] elephant men for their ''strength'', their ''amazing trunks'', their ''calves' spirited antics'', their ''tusks'', their ''great weight'', their ''social behavior'', their ''flappy ears'', their ''uprooting of trees'', their ''aggressive sparring'', their ''trumpeting'', their ''tool use'' and their ''self-awareness''.

<!-- Reference: Joseph Merrick, the "Elephant Man" -->
Despite popular belief, elephant men are not [[human]]s with physical deformities featured as exhibits; though, some elephant men ''do'' have lots of deformities and scars, due to tanking lethal attacks of enemies while unarmored (it's hard to find elephant-sized armor nowadays).
