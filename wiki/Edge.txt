[[Material]]s have a sharpness property, defined as {{token|MAX_EDGE|md|<number>}}. In combat, this presumably defines how well the material works when used for [[slashing]] attacks.

Most materials draw this from their Material template, but placing a <code>[MAX_EDGE]</code> tag in the material's entry will override this and allow it to be sharper than other objects of its kind. For example, Obsidian has <code>[MAX_EDGE:20000]</code>, while the Stone Material Template has <code>[MAX_EDGE:1000]</code>. Incidentally, it seems that this is what allows Obsidian to be made into stone swords; a value of at least 10000 has been proven to also work.

Actual weapon sharpness depends on its [[quality]]: masterwork and [[artifact]] blades have the above-mentioned maximum material edge, while regular-quality items get only half as much.
