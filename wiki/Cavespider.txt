A '''cave spider''' is a type of [[Caverns|subterranean]] [[vermin]]. It produces [[web]]s that can be collected and [[loom|woven]] into [[thread|cave spider silk thread]].

Cave spiders can be annoying and beneficial at the same time. They will usually hang out around underground areas like [[cavern|caverns]] or underground water sources. They will leave [[web]]s around these areas or even in your fortress that can be collected via the 'collect webs' job at the [[loom]], which is created automatically when webs are around. They can be annoying because they will bite the occasional pet or dwarf, though they're only mildly [[Syndrome|venomous]]. However, their bite induces a permanent syndrome, which, although not severe (very mild chronic dizziness), can prove crippling to a dwarf whose job needs immediate reaction (e.g. soldiering or lever-pulling). Dizziness also [http://www.bay12forums.com/smf/index.php?topic=147897.msg5984259#msg5984259 reduces the potential quality of items] made by the dwarf, and probably applies other penalties yet to be discovered. Cave spiders are hateable vermin and will produce an [[Thought#Unhappy_Thoughts|unhappy thought]] for dwarves who detest them.

A cave spider caught in an animal trap, along with a [[glass]] [[vial]], can be used to create cave spider [[venom]]. This has no use other than as a trade good. See [[extracts]] and [[animal dissector]] for more information.

Some dwarves [[Preferences|like]] cave spiders for their ''mystery''.

If you have [[cat]]s around your fortress, they will hunt cave spiders down without mercy just like any other vermin, and this can be a bit annoying if you want those webs. You can attempt to solve this problem by confining all unattached cats using [[cage]]s or [[restraint]]s and eliminating cats that have [[pet|adopted]] a dwarf, but this approach can cause [[thought|happiness]] issues, and migrants will continue to introduce pet cats to your fortress.

Assigning pet cats to a small, out-of-the-way room designated as a [[pasture]] can effectively restrain them without causing the dwarf-happiness issues killing them would. Be aware that assigning many cats to too small a pasture will result in catfights.

==Industrial use==
Unfortunately, [[tame|taming]] a cave spider does not provide a source of controlled [[silk]] production, as cave spiders in cages will not spin webs. Because of this, a [[silk]] farm requires an area (potentially cleared and sealed, for dwarven [[unfortunate accident|safety]]) in which the vermin can run wild. Since cave spiders do not reproduce like creatures, any such farm will need to be in a [[biome]] that generates cave spiders. You can also dig out a room in an upper level (near your loom) and attach a lever to a placed cage {{k|q}}-{{k|a}}-{{k|j}} (much the same as you would with caged goblins, though be sure to tame the spiders), once the cage has been filled with tame cave spiders, {{k|q}}-{{k|a}}-{{k|P}} pull the lever, releasing the spiders (that have been caught in an animal trap baited with meat), they will be released and begin filling the area with webs without your dwarves and pets having to deal with bites.

Despite popular belief, cave spiders do not appear solely in abandoned mineshafts, and are not constantly spawned by square devices known as "monster spawners". The poison received from a cave spider cannot be negated by simply drinking [[milk]]. Despite further rumors by [[human]]s, cave spiders are not dark blue.
