'''Doctor''' refers to both a [[profession]] and an [[occupation]].

== Profession ==
The doctor profession contains skills relating to the recovery and healing of wounded dwarves.

An adult [[dwarf]] whose best [[skill]] is in this category, and who has accumulated ranks in other doctor skills (how much is not clear) will be known as a Doctor.  Once they have achieved 'grand master' skill in one of these skills, but not in the others, they will be known by this skill.

If a dwarf has [[experience]] in only one doctor skill, however, they will be known by his or her highest skill.   

The [[Health care]] skills are:

{{Skill Box|Doctor|5:0|5:0|
* [[Bone doctor]]
* [[Diagnostician]]
* [[Surgeon]]
* [[Suturer]]
* [[Wound dresser]]
}}

== Occupation ==

Any dwarf can be assigned the Doctor occupation at a [[hospital]]. This will enable them to perform [[diagnosis]], [[surgery]], and [[setting bones]].

=== Bugs ===
This occupation is affected by the [[Known bugs and issues#healthcare-labors-bug|healthcare labors bug]].
