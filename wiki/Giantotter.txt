'''Giant otters''' are over-sized cousins of the [[river otter]], growing to the size of a small [[donkey]]. Giant otters are typically nonthreatening [[amphibious]] creatures, though they may also serve as [[mount]]s during a [[siege]]. 

As exotic pets, giant otters can be tamed with moderate effort, or potentially purchased tame from [[elf|elven]] [[caravan]]s. They have a similar pet value to most other giant variants, and their [[butcher]]ing returns are only common value. Still, a breeding pair of giant otters will provide convenient [[grazer|non-grazing]] stock for your [[meat industry]]. 

Some dwarves [[Preferences|like]] giant otters for their ''playfulness'' and their ''fluffy faces''.
