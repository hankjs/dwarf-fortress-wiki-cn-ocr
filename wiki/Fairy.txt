'''Fairies''' are a type of [[fanciful]] above-ground [[vermin]] that live in [[good]] areas. They, alongside [[pixie]]s, are the only intelligent vermin in the game, though they can't be interacted with on the basis of being vermin. When encountered in [[adventure mode]], they will glow in the dark (''or should; see below''). They possess a [[pet]] value of 10. As they possess the VERMIN_NOTRAP token, they cannot be captured by placing [[animal trap]]s, but they can still be trapped using the ''catch live land animal'' task.

Contrary to their {{token|DESCRIPTION|c}} and {{token|PREFSTRING|c}} (and Premium graphics), fairies don't actually have wings in their {{token|BODY|c}} definition at all, lacy or otherwise, though they are still capable of flying anyways. A nearby comment in the raws suggests that [[Main:Toady One|Toady]] plans to eventually give them lacy wings.

While a token in their creature raws should enable them to generate light, they cannot, as they lack the necessary graphical tokens and sprite creature graphics to do so.

Some [[dwarves]] [[Preferences|like]] fairies for their ''lacy wings'' and their ''babylike giggles''.
