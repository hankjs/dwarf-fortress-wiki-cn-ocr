Though considerably dangerous, '''gigantic pandas''' can be a great asset to your fortress. Consider embarking near a temperate forest, on the chance that you might encounter this creature. It can be considered a must-cage creature for its tremendous size, value and [[training|train-ability]] (for hunting or war). 

However, like their smaller [[panda]] relatives, trained gigantic pandas must graze on [[bamboo]], and given their immense size, they must graze '''constantly''' to avoid starvation, making them a very poor choice for training and livestock. Their [[butcher]]ing returns are twice as valuable as common creatures, but their dietary requirements make gigantic pandas a better target for [[hunting]] than husbandry.

It should be noted that this creature is considered gigantic, ''not'' merely giant. Like the [[gigantic squid]] and [[gigantic tortoise]], this is presumably to avoid confusion since "giant panda" is the formal name of ''normal'' [[panda]]s.

Some dwarves [[Preferences|like]] gigantic pandas for their ''enormous size'', their ''striking coloration'', their ''gigantic fluffy heads and bellies'' and their ''lazy nature''.
