'''Common snapping turtles''' are smaller cousins of [[alligator snapping turtle]]s. They appear individually in temperate [[lake]]s and [[river]]s. About half the size of an average dwarf, they are aggressive and will fight back when provoked, though they prefer to flee if given the chance.

They can be caught in [[cage trap]]s, and are a decent source of [[egg]]s and [[meat]], should you capture a breeding pair, but keep in mind that you won't be able to fully domesticate them. They are fairly long-lived and reach their full size at the age of one year, and should be butchered at that time for the maximum amount of returns. Common snapping turtles have low [[pet|pet value]], so you shouldn't consider selling them as pets. All products from them are worth the same as these from domestic animals.

Some dwarves [[preferences|like]] common snapping turtles for their ''powerful bites'' and their ''long necks''.
