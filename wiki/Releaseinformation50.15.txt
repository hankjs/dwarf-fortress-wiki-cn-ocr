{{release notes}}

:We have a Fortress Mode patch this week, with a bunch of fixes and tweaks and most notably with the new container graphics. See exactly what's inside your barrels and boxes for easy sorting

:We are still working on [[Adventurer mode|Adventure Mode]] things but won't have a patch for a few weeks which means this will be our last update before the holidays. But not to worry, it will be coming VERY SOON! When Adventure Mode leaves beta, it will unify both branches so a lot of upgrades in Adventure Mode will be making their way to [[Dwarf fortress mode|Fort Mode]] as well. We hope you have a relaxing and restful holiday!
