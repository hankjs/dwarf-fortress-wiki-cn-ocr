'''Cashews''' are one of the many genera of trees found above ground. Like the vast majority of above ground trees, cashew [[wood]] is brown and produces brown products.

While the cashew apple can be harvested and eaten, the cashew leftover cannot currently (''except for modding the cashew seed definition'') be used.

Some [[Dwarf|dwarves]] [[Preferences|like]] cashew trees for their ''fruit and nuts''.
