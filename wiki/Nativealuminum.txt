'''Native aluminum''' is the only [[ore]] of [[aluminum]], a [[metal]] with the same [[value]] as [[platinum]]. It occurs in [[cluster|small clusters]] and is relatively rare.

=== In real life ===
Native aluminum is not strictly an "ore", but rather chunks of aluminum found in a naturally formed (native) metallic state.  As aluminum is a very reactive metal, it's rarely found in such deposits, and the few natural deposits that do exist are found in strongly reducing environments. Most aluminum today is extracted from [[bauxite]] via a procedure called the Hall–Héroult process. Before the Hall-Héroult process, aluminum used to be rarer and more valuable than gold, despite being the most common metallic element in the earth's crust. Rumor has it Napoleon III had a treasured set of aluminum utensils for his most valuable guests, and the rest had to settle with plain gold.
