[[File:forbid_icon_preview.png|right]]An item that is '''forbidden''' will never be handled by your dwarves, and will appear surrounded by braces in ASCII -- { } -- or marked with a lock in the premium version to signify that they are forbidden. (In-game, these braces can be difficult to distinguish from [[Item_designations#Provenance_.2F_Ownership|parentheses]], which are used to signify that the object was manufactured outside the [[fortress]].) Forbidden objects still contribute to fortress value.
It is the opposite of [[reclaim]]. For example, [[stone]]s that have been forbidden will not appear in the [[construction]] menu, and will not be used at [[workshop]]s. If a forbidden object is on a build site, the building will be suspended and an [[Dwarf_cancels_Construct_Building:_Item_blocking_site|announcement]] will appear, informing the player that the build site is blocked.

Note: If you click a [[door]] or [[floor hatch]], the [[File:Button door forbid.png]] lock option is to ''"Forbid Passage''". That does not "forbid" the door/hatch itself.

==Forbidding items==
*In order to forbid a specific loose item, click on the item you wish to forbid and then press [[File:Button forbid.png]] in order to toggle the forbidden state of the item.
*In order to mass forbid entire swathes of items, use the {{menu icon|i|f}} keys and designate items with either the keyboard or the mouse.
*With a [[bookkeeper]], specific items and entire classes of items can be forbidden in the [[stocks]] screen.
*In order to prevent your dwarves from using a specific workshop or trap, press [[File:Button forbid.png]] near the materials that it is made of. 
*Using the [[standing orders]] menu, certain items can be automatically forbidden (like fired ammunition and battlefield spoils).

==Uses of forbidding items==

*Dwarves in [[strange mood]]s can be directed to materials of your choice by selectively forbidding objects.
*Preventing dwarves from looting the bodies of the fort's enemies (or friends) during a [[siege]] by forbidding items on the battlefield is generally a good idea. You can also go to the {{menu icon|y}} Labor menu > [[Standing orders]] > Sieges and forbidding to make these items forbidden by default.
*You can use the mass designation tool to forbid items in sealed off areas in order to get a more accurate representation of available resources in your stocks screen. Don't forget to reclaim when it's time to go spelunking!
*Forbidding [[egg]]s in a [[nest box]] keeps them out of dwarven hands long enough for them to hatch.
*Forbidding an item hauled by a dwarf will cause him to drop it once he realizes it is forbidden. 
*Forbidding materials clears any in-process hauling jobs; using local materials can allow you to complete [[construction]]s much faster than hauling the materials to a central location then back out to the job site.
*Forbidding [[trap]]s will prevent your mechanics from dashing out in the middle of a battle to reset them.
*You can forbid your good ammunition during peaceful times, so that your dwarves instead use wood arrows for target practice and hunting (and also by specifying different materials for training and combat bolts and for hunters).
*Forbidding owned items stored in a dwarf's quarters will clear the ownership after some weeks.

==Getting items back==

*You can always toggle the [[File:Button forbid active.png]] forbidden state of the item again.
*The mass reclaim function {{menu icon|i|F}} can be used to regain access to forbidden items if needed.
*With a [[bookkeeper]], specific items and entire classes of items can be reclaimed in the [[stocks]] screen.
