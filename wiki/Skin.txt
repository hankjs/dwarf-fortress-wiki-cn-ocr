:''This article refers to "hide" in terms of the skin of a creature, for the article on hiding items and buildings, see [[cv:Hide_Items_or_Buildings|Hide Items or Buildings]].''
[[File:skin_preview.png|right]]'''Skin''' is a tissue layer common to most [[creature]]s. Different types of creatures have different types of skin.
* Most mundane creatures have raw hide, which displays in-game as '''skin'''. This is the only type that can be tanned into leather.
* Arthropod creatures have untannable '''chitin'''. Much tougher than normal skin, chitin serves as the skeleton of most creatures that have it, meaning damage immediately affects structural function.
* Reptilian creatures and fish generally have untannable '''scales'''. Somewhat tougher than ordinary skin, scales slightly reduce damage from weaker sources.
Skins (both fresh and rotten) are stored in a [[refuse]] [[stockpile]] under the names "fresh raw hide" and "rotten raw hide" respectively in the stockpile menu. Each butchering job produces a single skin, but tanning a hide may produce multiple pieces of leather, depending on the creature's size.

== Skin uses ==
Raw skin can be processed at a [[tanner's shop]] by a dwarf with the [[tanning]] labor enabled in order to produce [[leather]], or a dwarf with the [[tanner]] labor enabled can bring a skin and a bucket of [[milk of lime]] to a [[tanner's shop]] to produce a sheet of parchment. Skins are automatically tanned if the "Auto tan" [[standing orders#Workshop orders|order]] is enabled. If skins are not tanned automatically, you can use your [[manager]] to automatically queue "Tan a Hide" jobs, or manually queue jobs from a tanner's shop. Scales and chitin cannot be tanned (aside from [[modding|shenanigans being done]]).

== Leather ==
{{main|Leather}}
Leather can be used to make [[clothing]] and low-grade [[armor]]. Leather is also used to make [[bag]]s, [[waterskin]]s, [[clothing]], [[shield]]s, [[armor]], [[trade good|crafts]] and [[decorate|decorations]], among other items. It is, practically speaking, the ''only'' material to produce [[quiver]]s and [[backpack]]s, at least early in a fortress. The process of making and using leather is part of the [[meat industry]], rather than the [[clothing industry]].

== Modding scales to be usable in leatherworking ==
{{mod}}
If you want to make items out of scale or chitin, add these tokens to SCALE_TEMPLATE or CHITIN_TEMPLATE in material_template_default.txt in the game [[raw file|raw]]s:

<div style="height:100px; overflow:;"><pre>
	[LEATHER]
	[ITEMS_LEATHER]
	[BUTCHER_SPECIAL:SKIN_TANNED:NONE]
</pre></div>

This will make butchering yield several sheets of the creature's scale that are usable in leatherworking, instead of regular unusable scales.
