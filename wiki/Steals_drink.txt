Creatures with the {{token|CURIOUSBEAST_GUZZLER}} [[DF2012:Creature_token#C|creature token]] will happily devour your [[alcohol]] stocks, if given the chance - this can prove particularly [[fun]] when your newly-founded fort's entire alcohol supply is still sitting topside in the [[wagon (embark)|wagon]].

This property can also be used to capture certain creatures (such as [[grizzly bear]]s) by surrounding a small drink stockpile with [[cage]] traps.
