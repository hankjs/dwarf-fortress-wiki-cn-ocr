'''Mantis men''' are [[animal people]] variants of the common [[mantis]] who can inhabit most [[savage]] [[biome]]s. They spawn in groups of 1-3 individuals and are generally content to keep to themselves, but may pick fights if provoked. In terms of size, they are a little over half the weight of the average [[dwarf]]. All mantis men are born with Legendary [[skill]] in [[Climber|climbing]].

Like other savage animal people, mantis men can join [[civilization]]s, become [[historical figure]]s, appear as [[visitor]]s and be playable in [[adventurer mode]].

Some dwarves [[Preferences|like]] mantis men for their ''grasping legs'' and their ''predatory nature''.

<!-- Reference: Portal 2 - Cave Johnson quote -->
For the beta testers for mantis men, there was good news and bad news. The bad news is those copies of the beta were postponed indefinitely. The good news is we don't have to deal with an army of mantis men. So take arms and kill any you happen to see on your map.

Not telepathic, contrary to popular opinion.

Can fly to fuel nightmares.
