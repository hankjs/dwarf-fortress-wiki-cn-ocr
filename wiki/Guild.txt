'''Guilds''' are organizations established when enough members of your [[fortress]] practice the same [[profession]], or professions in the same category. The required number of members defaults to 10, but this can be changed in the [[Difficulty#Guilds|difficulty]] settings. Allowing many dwarves to do the same [[labor]]s can lead to them learning enough of that skill to form a guild, as can migrants arriving with skills in the same category. Dwarves with a profession with its own guild and one for the more general category will be members of both guilds.

The name of a guild and its associated guildhall will reflect the profession of the guild, for example "The Guild of Oiling", a [[Metalsmith]] guild with a guildhall named "The Cave of Copper", or "The Autumnal Guild", a [[Ranger]] guild with a guildhall named "The Grove of Deer".

{{main|Guildhall}}
Shortly after establishment, the guild will petition for the construction of a guildhall, where its members will socialize and hold [[skill]] demonstrations, slowly training them in the skill. However, any guildhall can be built at any time, and even if a guild is not established, any one with the right skill can still hold public demonstrations for idlers; this is useful for having dwarves teach each other [[strange_mood|desirable]] skills. If a guild grows to enough members (25 by default, but can also be changed), they will petition for a Grand guildhall.

A guildhall requires a certain [[Zone#Quality and value|zone value]] to be considered established, as [[appraiser|appraised]] by the fortress' [[broker]]; the default values are 2000☼ to upgrade a meeting place to a guildhall and 10,000☼ for a grand guildhall, but these can be changed in the [[Difficulty#Guilds|difficulty]] settings. Accepting either petition but failing deliver one with enough value, will cause negative thoughts for the guild members after a year.

==List of guilds==
This is a list of guildhalls that you can select when adding a new [[location]] (e.g. {{menu icon|z}} -> set a zone -> [[File:Ui location add.png|28px]] -> "New guildhall" -> choose a guild type). General guilds are in '''bold''', followed by specific guilds they include.

==Guilds in World Generation==
Guilds are formed in world generation, by civilizations that value [[Personality value#CRAFTSMANSHIP|craftsmanship]], such as [[dwarf|dwarves]] and [[human]]s. These guilds will have various [[historical figure]]s take up positions in them, as well as build themselves guildhalls in settlements, and have also been observed to occasionally help construct monasteries for [[Temple|religious groups]]. There are always four possible positions in the generated guilds: A Leader (dean/doyer, handles negotiations), an Alderman (manages work orders), a Steward (handles trade) and a Clerk/[[Record keeper]]. These positions are not yet available within fortress mode, and thus, guilds made in fortresses don't get them.

{{D for Dwarf}}
In light of recent accidents, the Farmer's Guild has been restricted from performing any gelding demonstrations until further notice.

Fisherdwarves with Master or higher skill in fishing appear to be able to lead milking demonstrations at legendary level, regardless of their actual Milker skill.

Despite recent events in the human world, the Writer's Guild of the Mountainhomes is still working...for now.

The Stone Carvers Guild has been outlawed for undwarven activities. The Stone Cutters Guild has been outlawed for failure to follow Dwarven Occupation Safety Guidelines.
