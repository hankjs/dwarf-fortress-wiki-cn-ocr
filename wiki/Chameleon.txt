'''Chameleons''' are a species of [[above ground]] [[vermin]] found in a variety of [[biome]]s, from [[desert]]s to [[tropical]] [[forest]]s.

They are notably the greatest [[egg]]-layers of all vermin, laying 40 to 50 eggs at a time. However, due to being vermin, these eggs can't be gathered through [[egg production]]. Fortunately, they can potentially be requested when [[trading]] with other races such as [[human]]s if they happen to settle in a region with chameleons in it, and their [[giant chameleon]] counterparts lay just as many eggs which can be freely used by your [[dwarves]].

Curiously, chameleons in ''Dwarf Fortress'' have a body striped with all the colors of the rainbow, as their ability to change color has not been implemented yet.

Some dwarves [[Preferences|like]] chameleons for their ''ability to change color'' and their ''eyes''.
