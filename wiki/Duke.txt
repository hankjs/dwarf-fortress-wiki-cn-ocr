The '''Duke''' (or Duchess) is the next step up from a [[Count]].  Your county becomes a duchy after satisfying certain requirements and meeting with the [[liaison]]; once the liaison leaves the map, your [[Count]] will be promoted. As with the upgrade to a County, this is automatic and cannot be rejected.

<!-- Reference: Duke Nukem video game series -->
Dukes are aggressive military commanders, but not fond of taking casualties; if a goblin siege or a megabeast shows up, they'll be happiest if you skip dwarf-to-dwarf combat and [[Megaproject|nuke 'em]]. Keep them well supplied with chewing gum, and far away from your fort's donkeys.
