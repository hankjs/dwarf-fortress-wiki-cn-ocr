{{creaturedesc}}
A long, short-legged, flying insect the size of a [[giant cave spider]], it has no direct means of attack, but like all insects it will [[push]] and wrestle enemies with legs and wings pretty well, even if it shouldn't be intelligent enough to do so. Also, they seem to be able to throw dwarves disproportionately long distances, sometimes resulting in dwarven explosions when thrown. If aggressive, they are a match for a dwarf, and will probably win the ensuing fight.

Thrips and giant thrips, despite being well-known agricultural pests, will do no harm to plants for now. They mostly spend their time flying high above ground in groups of five to ten, generally doing nothing useful and preventing more interesting animals from entering your map. Can be used as a food source or marksdwarf training target.  They make for poor livestock since their maximum age is one year.

== Adventure Mode ==
Giant thrips are useful in Adventure Mode, as they take a long time to die. Because of their armor-like chitin, most attacks, even to the head, won't cause much damage besides shattering the chitin, which does not bleed like flesh does. This means that they make great training dummies to train up weapon skills on. As long as you avoid slicing off body parts so they don't bleed too much, a giant thrips should stay alive for a long time while you slice/bash the heck out of it. They aren't dangerous opponents at all, and most of the time all they will do is charge you harmlessly.
