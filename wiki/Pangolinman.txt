'''Pangolin men''' are humanoid versions of the common [[pangolin]] and a [[Creature|species]] of unremarkable [[animal people]], found in [[savage]] [[tropical]] plains and [[forest]]s. They are only a little over half the size of an adult [[dwarf]], making them unlikely to pose a threat to civilians and even less to [[military]] squads.

Like other savage animal people, pangolin men may occasionally join [[civilization]]s, becoming full-fledged citizens who may appear in your fortress as [[visitor]]s or be playable in [[adventurer mode]].

Some dwarves [[Preferences|like]] pangolin men for their ''overlapping scales''.

{{D for Dwarf}}
There's been [[Rumor|rumors]] of pangolin men with glowing white scales scouring ancient [[ruins]] for [[Topic|technology]] to commune with. However whether or not these may be true: after a lengthy interview with one of ''eir'' "watchers," even without [[Civilization|hierarchy]]: it has became clear ''ey'' follow a [[Religion|faith]] that drives ''em'' to discovery.
