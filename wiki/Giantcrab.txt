As its name suggests, the '''giant crab''' is an especially large [[Creature|version]] of the [[crab]], and can be found on [[savage]] [[Ocean|beaches]], where they spawn one at a time. Standing 32 times larger than a normal crab, these creatures are large enough to not be intimidated by the presence of [[dwarves]] and will fight if provoked, which may be a fatal encounter for a civilian who just happened to be on its path. However, they should not prove to be a threat to a [[crossbow]]-wielding [[hunter]] or a half-competent [[military]] squad.

Like their smaller counterparts, all giant crabs possess Legendary [[skill]] in [[Climber|climbing]] as well as blue-colored [[blood]]. Unlike normal crabs, however, they are [[animal trainer|tamable]] creatures with the standard high pet value of giant animals, meaning they can be freely used as valuable [[pet]]s or in the [[meat industry]]. Giant crabs are considered exotic [[mount]]s, so you may see [[Elf|elves]] riding them into battle in the event of a [[siege]].

Some dwarves [[Preferences|like]] giant crabs for their ''pincers'' and their ''sideways walk''.

As with most creatures, the best way to defeat the giant enemy crab is to attack its weak point for massive damage.
