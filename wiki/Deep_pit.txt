'''Deep pits''' are a type of hollow underground feature, basically holes of a fixed shape reaching down from one [[caverns|cavern]] layer to the next. The top [[z-level]], where the pit meets the next cavern level, is un-muddied rough rock floor where the normal space of the deep pit and the random rock spires of the cavern collide.

Deep pits act as a flyer-only passage for lower-level creatures to path to your fortress, which <strike> is a bad thing</strike> could be [[fun]]. On the other hand, they can be used for garbage disposal and in retracting-[[bridge]] [[trap design|trap]]s, as it's a long, long way down to the bottom, and will render anything that falls through into bloody splatters.
