'''Giant dragonflies''' are much larger versions of the standard [[vermin]] [[dragonfly]], appearing in savage [[lake]]s.

They aren't very useful for anything other than immediate [[butcher]]ing, as they have a maximum lifespan of one year like other giant insects. And as they are not {{token|BENIGN|c}}, wild ones may annoyingly interrupt your [[dwarf|dwarves]] when spotted.

Some dwarves [[Preferences|like]] giant dragonflies for their ''faceted eyes''.
