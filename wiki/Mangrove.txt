'''Mangrove trees''' are a type of [[above ground]] [[tree]] unique to a single [[biome]]: the [[swamp|mangrove swamp]], a particular type of [[tropical]] [[water#Salt water|saltwater]] swamp in which mangrove trees will grow near [[river]]s and [[pool]]s of water. Like the overwhelming majority of overland trees, mangrove [[wood]] is brown and produces brown products. Mangrove wood is notable for its high density. Logs and leaves can be processed in a [[dyer's shop]] into burnt umber [[dye]].


Some [[Dwarf|dwarves]] [[Preferences|like]] mangroves for their ''roots''.
