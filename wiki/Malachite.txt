'''Malachite''' is one of several [[ore]]s of [[copper]]. It is found as [[vein]]s, is rare compared to other copper ores, and is among the few types of stone that are not [[fire-safe]].

Other copper ores include [[native copper]] and [[tetrahedrite]].

"Malachite" is the name of the 5th month of the dwarven [[calendar]], covering mid-Summer.

==In real life==
Malachite is a hydrated copper carbonate (Cu<sub>2</sub>(CO<sub>3</sub>)(OH)<sub>2</sub>) that forms as a result of the weathering of pre-existing copper deposits. Malachite is known to form alongside both [[Chrysocolla]], and Azurite (which is not present in ''Dwarf Fortress'') which it commonly pseudomorphs from.
