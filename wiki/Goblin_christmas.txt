'''Goblin Christmas''' (sometimes also [[Elf|Elf Christmas]], but only if your dwarves have been ''very'' [[war|good]]) is the wonderful [[siege|time]] of year when [[siege|"A vile force of darkness has arrived and is unloading its goods!"]]. All the good little dwarves stay [[underground]] while [[Goblin|Goblin Claus]] leaves his treats in the [[trap]]-lined entrance to the fortress.  

In the morning, when the all-clear is sounded, everyone rushes to the entryway, and gathers up the [[Goblinite]] for [[melt]]ing and the [[silk]] [[Clothing|sock]]s for [[decorate|decorating]] the magma fireplace.

Don't be like the bad dwarves, who peek at their presents too early or leave the doors open for Goblin Claus to get in. [[Death|Bad things]] happen to those dwarves.

Recently, Goblin Claus has returned to the tradition of the days of [[23a:Main Page|yore]], sending his [[Troll|helpers]] and making Goblin Christmas much more [[Fun]]. In rare occasions, [[Demon|Goblin Claus himself]] has been reported to make a personal appearance.

[[Human|Human Christmas]] can also happen, but because of the more advanced nature of the Humanite it is often advised to take great care in receiving gifts from [[Human|Human Santa]].
