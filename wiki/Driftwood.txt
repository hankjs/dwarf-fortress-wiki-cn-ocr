[[File:driftwood_sprite_preview.png|right]]'''Driftwood''' is a feature of [[Ocean|beach]] maps. It replenishes over time, and can randomly appear on any non-water tile in an [[ocean]] biome. It cannot be harvested for [[wood]], nor can it be [[smoothing|smoothed over]]. Note that you cannot see the rock type of a driftwood tile while the driftwood is present.

Driftwood can be removed by {{k|b}}uilding a [[Road|r{{k|o}}ad]] or a Constructio{{k|n}} (such as a [[Wall|wal{{k|l}}]]) on the tile, which will transform the tile into an ordinary tile of the base [[Stone|rock]] type. Removing the construction will leave an ordinary rock or soil tile. [[Furniture]], however, can be constructed on top of driftwood without affecting it. Additionally, driftwood is immune to [[dwarven atom smasher]]s. [[Cave-in]]s will only destroy driftwood when a natural [[wall]] lands on it. 

Driftwood can appear when mining out a section of a frozen [[ocean]] directly above a rock or soil layer (i.e. the ocean floor), but not in a [[glacier]].

Driftwood is not destroyed by contact with [[magma]], but it is destroyed by casting in [[obsidian]].
