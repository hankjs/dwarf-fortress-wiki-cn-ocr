'''Muskoxen''' are large [[Creature|animals]] who inhabit [[tundra]]s and [[temperate]] [[grassland]]s, where they appear in herds of 3-7 individuals. Slightly smaller than a [[donkey]], these creatures are benign and will flee from [[Dwarf|dwarves]] rather than cause them trouble, making them easy targets for your [[hunter]]s. They are able to pull [[wagon]]s and can be used as pack animals by [[Trading|merchant]]s. They possess thick fur which provides them with increased insulation compared to most other animals, and their young are called ''calves''.

Muskoxen can be captured in [[cage]] [[trap]]s and [[Animal trainer|trained]] into fairly valuable exotic [[pet]]s. They are [[grazer]]s and require a [[pasture]] to survive after being trained. They provide a good amount of returns when [[butcher]]ed and serve as a source of [[Horn|hooves]] if no others are available.

Some dwarves [[Preferences|like]] muskoxen for their ''strength''.
