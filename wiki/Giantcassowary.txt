'''Giant cassowaries''' are the much [[Giant animal|bigger]] [[savage]] counterpart of the common [[cassowary]], found in a savage [[tropical]] moist broaflead [[forest]]s. The birds are considerably larger than [[Dwarf|dwarves]], being heavier than a [[moose]], though despite this they are still benign and will rarely fight back if provoked. In the event they do, they can deliver formidable kick attacks which might turn your dwarves' heads into sauce, so you may want to confront them with a few armored [[military]] dwarves rather than a mere [[hunter]].

Giant cassowaries can be captured with [[cage]] [[trap]]s and [[Animal trainer|trained]] into [[pet]]s, possessing the standard value of a giant creature. While they lay a poor amount of [[egg]]s compared to most domestic poultry, they give a sizeable amount of returns when [[butcher]]ed, making the idea of a giant cassowary farm an attractive one if a breeding pair is obtained. Like most creatures, they reach their full size at two years of age and should be butchered at that point for maximum return efficiency. Giant cassowaries are exotic [[mount]]s and may be seen being ridden by [[Elf|elves]] during [[siege]]s.

Some dwarves [[preference|like]] giant cassowaries for their ''casques''.
