[[File:furnace_preview.png|right]]'''Furnace''' is an umbrella term for different related [[workshop]]s that heat materials for different purposes. While a "[[wood furnace]]" may be the most basic of these, the list includes smelters and kilns. These different workshops often produce only intermediary products, items that are then used to create something else for the final product.  

Every furnace-type workshop '''must''' be built from [[fire-safe]] materials. 

Jobs at a furnace generally require [[fuel]] or, in the case of magma furnaces, the heat from [[magma]] - if the latter, they do not use up any magma but merely must be placed over it. To operate, magma version furnaces '''must''' be placed with one of their edge tiles above magma with depth of 4 or more. This can be accomplished by digging a channel for the magma, or hanging it directly over an open [[Magma#Magma_sources|magma source]]. 

Note that magma versions are '''not''' operable without magma. If the magma source fails, they cannot be used with [[fuel]]. If the magma depth falls below "depth = 4" at any time during operation (even for a single moment), any and all current job(s) will be cancelled in that workshop.

All furnaces are constructed using the Furnaces sub-menu (via {{menu icon|b|o|u}} ).  

See main articles for a full discussion of specific workshops, especially of magma versions.


== [[Wood furnace]] ==
Turns [[wood]] [[log]]s into [[ash]] or [[charcoal]].
:*''Shortcut:'' {{menu icon|b|o|u|f}}
:*''Materials used:'' [[wood]]
:*''Items made:'' [[ash]], [[charcoal]]
::*''Feeds into:'' fuel for other furnaces, [[steel]] making, [[Ashery|asheries]] and [[soap]] production

== [[Smelter]] ==
Extracts [[metal]]s from their [[ore]]s, and produces [[coke]] from raw [[coal]].
:*''Shortcut:'' {{menu icon|b|o|u|l}}
:*''Materials used:'' [[bituminous coal]], [[lignite]], [[ore]], [[metal]] [[bar]]s, [[flux]], [[fuel]] (and metal objects to be [[melt]]ed)
:*''Items made:'' [[coke]], metal [[bar]]s
::*''Feeds into:'' [[Forge]]s

===[[Magma smelter]]===
:*''Shortcut:'' {{menu icon|b|o|u|L}}
Note: The only time the magma version uses [[charcoal]] or [[coke]] is in the recipe for [[pig iron]] and [[steel]] production.

== [[Glass furnace]] ==
Turns raw [[sand]] into [[glass]] items.
:*''Shortcut:'' {{menu icon|b|o|u|g}}
:*''Materials used:'' [[sand]], [[pearlash]], [[rock crystal]], [[fuel]]
:*''Items made:'' [[glass]] objects
::*Glass objects are final products

===[[Magma glass furnace]]===
:*''Shortcut:'' {{menu icon|b|o|u|G}}
Magma glass furnaces use only magma as a heat source and require no additional [[fuel]]. They produce the same objects as a regular glass furnace.

== [[Kiln]] ==
Used to fire [[clay]] into items, and to glaze some types of clay items. It also is used to produce [[gypsum plaster]], [[pearlash]], and [[quicklime]].
:*''Shortcut:'' {{menu icon|b|o|u|k}}
:*''Materials used:'' [[potash]], [[ash]], [[cassiterite]], [[clay]], [[clay loam]], [[sandy clay]], [[silty clay]], [[fire clay]], [[kaolinite]], [[gypsum]], [[alabaster]], [[selenite]], [[satinspar]], [[fuel]]
:*''Items made:'' [[ceramic|ceramic/clay items]], [[pearlash]] and [[plaster powder]]
::*''Feeds into:'' pearlash for higher quality [[glass]] production
::*Plaster powder is a final product used by healthcare professionals.
::*Ceramic/clay (earthenware, stoneware, and porcelain) items are final products.

===[[Magma kiln]]===
:*''Shortcut:'' {{menu icon|b|o|u|K}}
Functions just like a regular kiln, but uses magma instead of [[fuel]].
