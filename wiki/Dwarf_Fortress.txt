'''''Dwarf Fortress''''' (formerly '''''Slaves to Armok: God of Blood Chapter II: Dwarf Fortress''''', referred to as '''DF''') is a part [[wikipedia: Construction and management simulation|construction and management simulation]], part [[wikipedia: roguelike|roguelike]], [[wikipedia: indie video game|indie]] video game created by [[Tarn Adams|Tarn]] (Toady One) and [[Zach Adams]] (ThreeToe). [[wikipedia: Freeware|Freeware]] and in development since 2002, its first [[wikipedia: alpha version|alpha version]] was released in 2006 and it received attention for being a two-member project surviving [[donation|solely on donations]]. The primary game mode is set in a [[wikipedia: procedurally generated|procedurally generated]] fantasy [[world]] in which the player indirectly controls a group of [[dwarves]], and attempts to construct a successful and [[wealth]]y [[fortress]]. Critics praised its complex, [[wikipedia: emergent gameplay|emergent gameplay]] but had mixed reactions to its [[Fun|difficulty]]. The game influenced ''[[wikipedia: Minecraft|Minecraft]] ''and was selected among other games to be featured in the [[wikipedia: Museum of Modern Art|Museum of Modern Art]] to show the history of video gaming in 2012.

The game has [[wikipedia: Text-based game|text-based]] graphics and is [[wikipedia: open-ended (gameplay)|open-ended]] with no main objectives. Before being played, the player has to [[world generation|generate]] worlds with continents, [[ocean]]s and histories documenting [[civilizations]]. The main game mode, [[Fortress Mode]], consists of selecting a suitable [[site]] from the generated-world, establishing a successful colony or fortress, combating threats like [[goblin]] [[invader|invasions]], generating wealth and taking care of the dwarves. Each dwarf is modeled down to its individual [[personality]], has [[Preferences|likes or dislikes]] and specific trainable [[skill]]s in various [[labor]]s, alongside a lovelife system and distractions. The second game mode, [[Adventure mode]], is a [[wikipedia: turn-based|turn-based]], open-ended roguelike where the player starts off as an [[adventurer]] in the world and is free to explore, complete quests, or even visit old [[ruin|abandoned fortresses]]. The [[combat|combat system]] is [[Anatomy|anatomically detailed]] with combat logs describing organs getting pierced, fat getting bruised and [[Body parts|limbs getting severed]].

Prior to ''Dwarf Fortress'', Tarn Adams was working on a project called ''Slaves to [[Armok]]: God of Blood'' which was a [[wikipedia: role-playing game|role-playing game]]. By 2004, Adams decided to shift from the original ''Armok'' to ''Dwarf Fortress'' after the former became difficult to maintain. Adams calls it his life's work and said in 2011, that version 1.0 will not be ready for at least another 20 years, and even after that he would continue to work on it. The game has a [[wikipedia: cult following|cult following]] and an active online community. As there is no way to win, every fortress, no matter how successful, is usually destroyed somehow. This prompts the game's tagline: "[[Losing is Fun]]!"

{{anchor|Classic version}}
== Classic vs. Premium == 
The current release of ''Dwarf Fortress'' is available in two versions. The '''Premium''' version is the paid version of the game first released on [https://kitfoxgames.itch.io/dwarf-fortress itch.io] and [https://store.steampowered.com/app/975370/Dwarf_Fortress/ Steam] platforms on December 6th 2022. Premium introduced a new rendering engine, user interface, pixel art [[graphics]], tutorials, [[Soundtrack|music tracks]], and sound effects. The current '''Classic''' version is the ASCII ''Dwarf Fortress'' with all the same game-play features and basic interface as the current Premium version, but without the graphics, music, and sound assets, which will release simultaneously and remain [[Installation|available for free]]. Additionally, the Steam version exclusively also includes automatic updates, occasional beta version availability, Steam Workshop integration for [[modding]], and a Steam Input profile for controller functionality.

==Gameplay==

===Overview and game modes===
''Dwarf Fortress'' has three primary game modes which take place in worlds created by the player, where most of the elements are randomly generated. [[Fortress Mode]] is a [[wikipedia: construction and management simulation|construction and management simulation]] of a colony of [[dwarves]]. There are no mandatory objectives, with the player being free to decide how to go about managing the colony and making them interact with the environment, thus making it an [[wikipedia: open-ended (gameplay)|open-ended]] and [[wikipedia: Sandbox game|sandbox]]-style game. While there is a progression of [[Noble|nobility]] all the way to becoming the seat of the dwarven [[monarch]], it is optional, and the session only ends when the entire colony is [[Losing|defeated by various possible threats]].

The original visuals are [[wikipedia: Text-based game|text-based]], using [[wikipedia: code page 437|code page 437]] characters in various [[color]]s as graphics. Thus, it is fully of [[Character table|letters, numbers and symbols]]; dwarves are represented by different colored smiling faces, a [[cat]] and [[dog]] are a white "c" and brown "d", while a [[giant cave spider]] is a grey "S".

[[Adventure mode]] is a [[wikipedia: turn-based|turn-based]], open-ended [[wikipedia: roguelike|roguelike]] where the player starts off as an adventurer. In [[Legends mode]], players can view maps, histories of each civilization and any figure who has lived or died in the generated world. Any noticeable achievement made by the player in any of the two game modes is recorded in the Legends. An [[object testing arena]] is present, where players can simulate battles between selected units in various conditions.

===World generation===
{{Main|World generation}}
[[File:WorldGenerationScreen.png|thumb|left|A world being generated and the years being counted. Each game is played in such generated worlds.]]
The first step in ''Dwarf Fortress'' is generating a [[World generation|playable world]]; only one game can be played per world at a time. The player can adjust certain [[World_generation#Parameters|parameters]] governing size, [[Surroundings|savagery]], mineral occurrences and the length of history. The map shows symbols representing [[road]]s, [[hill]]s, [[town]]s and [[cities]] of the various [[civilization]]s, and it changes as the generation progresses. A [[wikipedia: midpoint displacement algorithm|midpoint displacement algorithm]] generates the world.

The process involves [[wikipedia: procedurally generated|procedurally-generated]] basic elements like elevation, [[rain]]fall, mineral distribution, drainage and [[temperature]], using [[wikipedia: fractals|fractals]] (which give it an overall natural look). For example, a high-rainfall and low-drainage area would make a [[swamp]]. Areas are thus categorized into [[biome]]s, which have two variables: savagery and [[wikipedia: Alignment (role-playing games)|alignment]]. They have their own specific type of [[plant]] and [[animal]] populations. The next phase is erosion—which the drainage tries to simulate. [[River]]s are created by tracing their paths from the [[mountain]]s (which get eroded) to its end which is usually an [[ocean]]; some form into [[lake]]s. The salinity field defines oceans, [[mangrove]]s or [[alluvial]] plains. Names are generated for the biomes and rivers. The names depend on the area's [[good]]/[[evil]] variable (the [[alignment]]) and though in English, they are originally in one of the four [[language|in-game language]]s of [[dwarves]], [[elves]], [[human]]s and [[goblin]]s; these are the four main races in any generated world.

After a few minutes the world is populated and its history develops for the amount of in-game [[year]]s selected in the history parameter. Civilizations, races and religions spread and [[war]]s occur, with the "population" and "deaths" counters increasing. The ticker stops at the designated "years" value, at which point the world can be saved for use in any game mode. Should the player choose to retire a [[Dwarf fortress mode|fortress]] or gets [[losing|defeated]], this world will persist and will become available for further games.

===Fortress mode===
{{Main|Dwarf fortress mode}}
====Basics====
[[File:Embark A Map.png|thumb|The game uses text symbols for graphics. For example, a dwarf is a colored smiling face and various other letters represent animals. Here, dwarves and livestock around their wagon of supplies can be seen just after embark.]]

When Fortress mode is selected, the player is given the option to choose the [[embark|embark location]] in the world. The player must consider the environment, elevations, biome, soil types and mineral concentrations, which can pose significant challenges to the development or survival of the fortress.The colony's [[supplies]], [[domestic animals]], and skills can be customised, but each dwarf's [[mental attributes|mental]] and [[physical attributes]] are randomly generated,as are their mental abilities, individual preferences and desires. The game also describes in detail each dwarf's [[Physical_description|physical appearance]], like hair and facial features.. Each dwarf's [[relationships]] with others and the [[deities]] they worship can be viewed.

The player embarks with the expedition team (seven dwarves, and their livestock and supplies by default), and does not have direct control over them. In order to construct and operate the fortress, the dwarves undertake [[labor]]s as designated by the player. They can be assigned any labors, but their work still depends on their relative skill with it, which can increase. Some task categories are stone-working, woodworking, metalworking, farming-related and crafts-making; there are further combat-related skills. They are categorized further, such as [[leatherworking]], [[butchery]], [[clothesmaking]], [[gem]]-related, [[glassmaking]], and [[clay]]-related [[Industry|industries]]. Activities take place in [[workshop]]s which need to be constructed; for example, [[still]]s for brewing alcohol. The [[metal industry]] has a very important role because it produces [[weapon]]s and [[armor]] for the [[military]], [[trap component]]s for defense, and high-value [[furniture]] and [[decoration]]s.

==== Functional mechanics ====
The player initially can see a [[wikipedia: top-down view|top-down view]] of the surface-level of the fortress site; each [[layer]] of a [[z-axis]] [[z-level|level]] can be viewed when the player changes it. An entire underground level would be seen as its entire section of terrain while a mountain at the surface level would have only its section visible with the remaining surface landscape. Thus, for [[dig]]ging, the player can designate, for every z-level starting from the surface, [[staircase]]s to be carved and at the final designated level, ending the staircase by making it dug into a room.

The [[geology]] in ''Dwarf Fortress'' is fairly accurate. Rocks like [[olivine]] or [[gabbro]] can be dug up, while the topmost layer usually consists of [[sand]], [[clay]] or plain [[soil]]—this can be used for underground [[farming]]. Deeper levels are layers of rock; minerals appear in layers or [[cluster]]s around the right depth, while [[gem]]s like [[tourmaline]]s appear in rare clusters. [[Water]] is simulated like falling sand, every space can contain up to seven levels of it. A tile having "one" level of water is the lowest while a tile with "seven" is full. There is a system for simulating temperature and heat. [[Fire]]s can spread and burn dwarves and furniture. There are four basic [[season]]s in an in-game year as in real life: spring, summer, autumn and winter.

[[ore|Mineral ores]] can be mined just like normal stone and the raw ore can be [[smelting|smelted]] to produce their corresponding [[metal bars]]. Different ores or metal bars can be [[alloy]]ed together for higher quality materials. For [[steel]] production, [[flux]] stones are used to make [[pig iron]] bars and smelt it with regular [[iron]] and [[coal]] (or [[charcoal]]). Specific metal items can be melted back to their respective bars. Without steel, the alloy [[bronze]] or regular iron are the next best suitable metals to use. Bronze requires two ores or bars of [[tin]] and [[copper]]. The metal [[adamantine]], found deep below, is extremely light but very strong, making it excellent for sharp weapons and armor. [[Raw adamantine]] can be [[Strand extractor|extracted into strands]] and can further be either woven in cloth or smelted into [[wafer]]s.

==== Fortress management and growth ====
Underground [[farming]] has customized crops like "[[plump helmet]]" mushrooms, which can be [[brewer|brewed]] to make [[dwarven wine|mushroom wine]]. As the fortress prospers, [[migrant]]s come in larger numbers from the [[mountain halls|mountainhome]] (the colony's home civilization) and will need further accommodation. [[Trading|Trading caravans]], which can be from the various neighboring civilizations including the home civilization, visit the fortress on a yearly basis and are useful for getting supplies not available in the player's fortress area. The role of [[record keeper]], [[manager]] and [[broker]] can be assigned to any dwarf during early game. The record keeper maintains records of every item present in the fort, the manager [[work order|auto-assigns jobs]] and the broker deals with trading caravans. The production of [[craft]]s from any material are useful for trading. The caravans come from civilizations of [[elves]] and [[humans]] but depending on the embark region and history, they may be absent or sometimes even hostile.

Dwarves need to be provided with [[food]] and [[drink]] (mostly in the form of [[alcohol]]). A dwarf will get [[negative thoughts]] for drinking plain water and even for drinking the same type of alcohol, making it necessary to grow different crops for producing different drinks. Things like not having a separate [[bedroom]] can upset a dwarf. They may make [[friend]]s and sometimes [[marriage|marry]]; females give birth. Dwarves can get upset by sustaining [[injuries]], having poor [[clothing]], [[death|losing]] their [[pet]]s, friends or relatives; interacting with or seeing their [[corpse]]s can aggravate this. A frustrated dwarf may [[tantrum|break furniture or attack others]]. Continuous stress will cause them to go [[insanity|berserk, becoming suicidal or going insane]] before their eventual deaths. Their quality of life can be improved by giving them luxurious personal bedrooms and a well-decorated dining room, [[health care|medical care]], and providing them with a variety of drinks and [[prepared meal|well-cooked meals]]. A [[tantrum spiral|chain reaction]] where a single dwarf's unhappiness causes the entire fortress's population to start throwing tantrums can begin when one dwarf throws a tantrum, attacks and kills another one with many friends, which drastically affects the happiness of many more.

As the fortress expands and develops, new [[noble]] positions become available. While regular dwarves will be happy with simple rooms provided to them, dwarves appointed or elected to noble positions will need more luxurious accommodation. Most nobles will even make [[demand]]s and [[mandates]], getting negative thoughts if they are not fulfilled. A [[justice]] system is present to punish [[crime|criminals]], for example, dwarves who injure or kill another dwarf or destroy furniture. Occasionally, a [[vampire]] dwarf, with a fake background history, may arrive with a migrant wave and start killing and feeding on the other citizens without being noticed.

Inspired or stressed dwarves will occasionally get into a "[[strange mood]]". They will take over a workshop and go searching for the required materials to begin construction of an [[artifact]]. If they cannot find the materials, the dwarf will wait at the workshop, demanding it till it is available. After a few in-game weeks, the work results in a legendary artifact, an item so masterfully crafted that it is usually worth more than a beginning fortress' total wealth put together. These artifacts will be added to the world's records and its exact description can be viewed. Through this entire period of being in a strange mood, a dwarf will not eat, drink or sleep and will eventually go [[insane]] if prolonged due to any reason.

====Threats, defense and digging deeper====
The first in-game year will usually consist of [[kobold]] [[thieves]] and [[goblin]] snatchers trying to infiltrate the fortress. Thieves try to steal valuables while snatchers try to kidnap dwarven [[children]] to raise them as future soldiers. Goblin and kobold civilizations near the fortress will always be hostile and a source of frequent attacks. Wildlife is usually harmless, but depending on the fortress's location, more fierce [[bear]]s, [[unicorn]]s, [[giant cave spider]]s and [[wolf|wolves]] may be a threat. [[Wealth]]ier and more [[immigration|populated]] fortresses will get [[ambush]]es and [[siege]]s from neighboring goblin (or other enemy) civilizations. A thriving fortress will attract certain [[megabeasts]] like [[hydra]]s, [[titan]]s or [[dragon]]s, and randomly-generated creatures called "[[Forgotten Beasts]]". These unique creatures have randomized physical qualities and abilities, thus making them have the potential to be very powerful. [[Undead]] attack mainly in evil biomes or if the player embarks with a [[Necromancer]] [[Tower (necromancy)|Tower]] being near the site. Undead are harder to kill, and often reanimate once they are defeated with their body parts being separate units to fight.

[[Military]] [[squad]]s can be assigned to a [[barracks]] to [[training|train]] in and a uniform (armor and a weapon) can be chosen. Squads can be directly commanded to [[attack]] enemies. [[Crossbow]]s can be made for ranged attacks and a [[Archery target|range with targets]] can be constructed for training. [[Wall]]s can be carved into [[fortification]]s and be used by ranged-units during attacks. Players can use [[trap]]s and [[engineer|engineering]] in addition to training an army. Traps can be made by constructing [[mechanisms]] and using metal or wood to construct large weapons like spikes, ax blades or [[cage]]s. More complex [[lever]]-operated and [[pressure plate]]-triggering trap components are available.

[[File:Combat report.png|thumb|left|Combat messages being displayed during Fortress Mode. Each message describes weapons striking specific parts of the combatants' bodies with organs getting pierced or limbs getting severed.]]
The [[combat]] system in ''Dwarf Fortress'' is [[anatomy|anatomically]] detailed. Combat is displayed by viewing the log which describes each weapon striking a specific part of the character's body. Internal organs can get punctured, combatants can fall to the ground, [[vomit]] and lose body parts. Each dwarf has individually detailed limbs, each with damageable bone, fat, muscle and skin. Fat can be bruised without breaking bones and vice versa. Injuries sometimes can be permanent. There is a medical system where a [[hospital]] can be set up containing [[crutch]]es for disabled dwarves, [[traction bench]]es, [[plaster]]s and cloth for [[cast]]s and bandages, thread for [[suturing]], and [[splint]]s.

[[Dig]]ging deeper is usually done for finding [[magma]], which as a [[fuel|fuel source]], removes the player's dependence on [[coal]] or [[wood]]. Another reason to dig deeper is for searching for specific raw materials, ores or gems. Magma pools or even bigger [[magma sea]]s are found while digging into warm rock. Near magma seas, raw adamantine [[wikipedia: stratum|strata]] can be found. They are shaped like columns, which pass down through the entire magma sea. These columns are hollow and can be broken, revealing an entire shaft leading deeper into the [[hell|underworld]]. [[Demon|Underworld creatures]] are countless and can bring entire fortresses to [[ruin]].

===Adventure mode===
{{main|Adventure mode}}
[[Adventure mode]] is a roguelike played in the generated world, and unlike Fortress mode, it is turn-based. In this mode, there is character creation similar to other role-playing games - players can choose a name, [[gender]], and spend points on specific combat and physical skills, where the amount depends on whether the player chooses a peasant, hero or demigod. The player's character starts off in a random town of their chosen civilisation, depending on their race, and can interact with the various [[wikipedia: non-player character|non-player character]]s (NPCs). NPCs can give quests (usually to slay an outlaw or megabeast), speak about the surrounding areas, or offer to follow and help the player. Players can choose to explore any part of the generated world using quick-travel mode. A player can find the area of their previously-slain character, visit old abandoned fortresses, or seek out their treasures and wield previously-made artifacts. Instead of quitting, the character can be retired, and depending on the player's achievements, their life events will be documented in the Legends Mode among the other historical figures.

==History==
:''See also: [[History of Adventure Mode]] and [[Release information]]''
===Early development (2002–2006)===
[[File:Tarn Adams.jpg|thumb|alt=Tarn Adams|Tarn Adams in 2013; he has been designing games since high school]]
[[File:ZachAdams.jpg|thumb|alt=Zach Adams|His older brother, Zach, who helped him with his game projects and ''Dwarf Fortress'']]
One of Tarn and Zach Adams' early works was a [[wikipedia: text based adventure game|text based adventure game]] called ''dragslay'', written in the [[wikipedia: BASIC|BASIC]] language and influenced by ''[[wikipedia: Dungeons and Dragons|Dungeons and Dragons]]''. This was the brothers' first fantasy project. In high school, Tarn Adams taught himself the [[wikipedia: C (programming language)|C programming language]] and developed it further. ''dragslay'' would later have an important influence on ''Dwarf Fortress''. Adams explained his interest in [[wikipedia: fantasy|fantasy games]], that he had grown up "surrounded by that sort of thing...along with generic sci-fi, generic fantasy is part of our heritage." Years later, before entering graduate school in mathematics, Adams began working on a project he called ''Slaves to Armok: God of Blood''. It was named after a deity in ''dragslay'', originally named for a variable "arm_ok"—which counted the limbs the player still had attached. This new project was a two-dimensional (would later have [[wikipedia: 3D graphics|3D graphics]]) [[wikipedia: isometric 3d|isometric]] fantasy role-playing game in which the player encountered and fought goblins.

Tarn took some time off ''Armok'' to work on small side-projects, and another one which would inspire ''Dwarf Fortress'' was ''Mutant Miner''. It was [[wikipedia: turn-based strategy|turn-based]] loosely inspired by a game called ''Miner VGA''. ''Mutant Miner'' involved the player digging underneath buildings, searching for ores and fighting monsters, and carrying radioactive "goo" back to the surface for application in growing extra limbs and gaining other abilities. Adams was dissatisfied with only having a single miner, and the game began to lag because it was turn-based. Adams said:

<blockquote>instead of rewriting the game, I thought, well maybe it should be dwarves instead. And it should be real-time to combat the [lag] problem. Now, you'd be digging out minerals in a mountain, combating threats inside, and making little workshops. Then I thought, well, how should the high score list work? We really like to keep records of plays. Not just high score lists, but expansive logs. So we'll often try to think of ways to play with the idea. This time, the idea was to let your adventurer come into the fortress after you lose and find the goblets you've made, and journals it generates.</blockquote>

===First release (2006)===
Adams began working on ''Dwarf Fortress'' in October 2002, estimating that the project would take two months, but suspended development soon after, in order to finish his previous work, ''Armok''. He explained that it began like the 1982 arcade game ''[[wikipedia: Dig Dug|Dig Dug]]''. The Adams brothers started the [[Bay 12 Games]] company, launching its website and releasing their games online. By 2004, Adams announced on his website that he would be switching his main project to ''Dwarf Fortress'' after he struggled to continue working on ''Armok'', after all its added features became harder to maintain. Adams explained that it would be a dwarf [[wikipedia: simulation game|simulation game]] but he kept Adventure mode as a surprise feature, which was revealed during its release. At that time, his fan base consisted of a few dozen people and more came in when he made this announcement. He put up a [[wikipedia: PayPal|PayPal]] button after a request from a fan; similarly, a subscriber system was added later. In the next five months, they made around $300, which brought in only enough to cover the site's $20 hosting cost. He dubbed the game as ''Slaves to Armok, God of Blood II: Dwarf Fortress''; Adams explained that it was a sequel because it continued to work on much of ''Armok's'' code but said its cumbersome name was mostly "for kicks."

Adams decided to focus on the game's development full-time during his first year of his math post-doctorate at [[wikipedia: Texas A&M|Texas A&M]] in 2006.
He quit it after a year and decided to use up his $15,000 savings. The university offered him $50,000 if he would stay another year. Adams agreed and commented on this, "I woke up the morning after I gave notice, like, I can actually make this work." Adams expected he would have to get a job in order to support himself and use his savings because the game had not been released yet. Development continued till 8 August 2006, when the first [[wikipedia: alpha version|alpha version]] (version 0.21.93.19a) was released. Donations reached $800–$1000 in the following months, this average increased gradually till they were financially stable. He then decided to solely rely on donations.

===Continued development (2007–2021)===
Adams did not use the 3D graphics which ''Armok'' had since its development was hampered because of it. He cited the ease in development of features like [[wikipedia: fluid simulation|fluid simulation]], copyright issues with the art and more unhindered possibilities as further reasons for not using it. Being used to the text-based graphics in [[wikipedia: roguelike|roguelike]]s, he did not want graphical [[wikipedia: Tile-based video game|tilesets]]. The story-generation originated first from ''Armok'', although present to some extent in ''dragslay''. Tarn and Zach would write different chapters of events they would like to see, mix it together and try to implement it. Most of this story writing is managed by Zach, who has a role in the game's development. He graduated in ancient history and books like ''[[wikipedia: The Twelve Caesars|The Twelve Caesars]]'' and the writings of [[wikipedia: Assyria|Assyria]]n kings influenced the game.

Tarn Adams was influenced by roguelike games like 1985 ''[[wikipedia: Hack (Unix video game)|Hack]]'' because of its randomly generated levels and detailed mechanics. The body part and wound system was inspired by 1990 role-playing game ''[[wikipedia: Cyberpunk 2020|Cyberpunk 2020]]''. Adams cited ''[[wikipedia: Ultima series|Ultima series]]'' as the inspiration for his generated worlds. He prefers modeling on individual elements, rather than entire systems, for better simulations with the outcomes being under his control. During world generation, he made an algorithm to simulate [[wikipedia: rain shadow|rain shadow]]s which occur in areas at the side of mountain deserts. For the distinct personalities of each unit, he took it from [[wikipedia: NEO PI-R|NEO PI-R test]] of which he admitted knowing little about. The feature of [[wikipedia: carp|carp]]s eating dwarves was unexpected when the game was released. He had written them having the same size and carps were designed to be carnivorous. Adams composed the game's [[wikipedia: Flamenco guitar|flamenco-inspired]] music.

A z-axis was introduced in the 2008 release because he felt the limitations with a single plane increasing; the feature of making various constructions like walls was also added at this time. In the earlier version, players could dig only into a mountainside and not underground because of having only one "z-level", thus it was considered "[[wikipedia: two-dimensional space|2D]]". This was significantly easier to maintain due to the limited playable area. Adams commented that this major change was further difficult to implement because of considering details like [[wikipedia: fluid mechanics|fluid mechanics]] and cave-ins. In 2012, more traps, abilities, [[wikipedia: syndrome|syndrome]]s, detailed cities and tombs were added in addition to vampiric and [[wikipedia: lycanthropic|lycanthropic]] infections, necromancers and undead.

On his reliance on PayPal donations, Adams says he is content. since he feels that people really like his work or they would not pay. Ever since its release, donations kept increasing and remaining stable except having a sudden increase during a new version update. He got $50,000 in 2010 following a major update after a long gap. Their expenses being low, he has maintained that he is happy as long as the game is self-sustaining and will not charge for it. In 2011, Adams refused a job offer from an unspecified major game developer and a $300,000 deal to license the name ''Dwarf Fortress'' from another company. Adams felt that this amount would not equate to the long-term donations he would receive. Adams said that he prefers working on his own and not being part of the gaming industry. In 2013, his average income was $4000 a month and Adams said, "Barely in the black one month, a little in the red another month. ... It's a risk I'm willing to take, and really I couldn't have it any other way." He has spent no money on advertising and was happy when bloggers, reviewers like former game journalist [[wikipedia: Kieron Gillen|Kieron Gillen]] from ''[[wikipedia: PC Gamer|PC Gamer]]'' and ''[[wikipedia: Games for Windows|Games for Windows]],'' wrote about his game. In 2015, Bay 12 Games set up a [[wikipedia: Patreon|Patreon]] account to help fund ''Dwarf Fortress''.

As of 2016 February, the latest update was version 0.42.06, years in development despite being in alpha version. Adams says he has been able to maintain focus by shifting his attention to different aspects of the game, given its numerous varied features. While regular game development aims to perfect their work for release, he considers this a drawback since he continues exploring and learning while adding new features. ''[[wikipedia: Wired (magazine)|Wired]]'' and [[wikipedia: Rock, Paper, Shotgun|Rock, Paper, Shotgun]] noted its sometimes funny but unintentional bug fixes, with ''PC Gamer'' saying it makes an entertaining [[wikipedia: RSS feed|RSS feed]] to subscribe to. Adams has two favorite bugs. One is about a farmer dwarf planting their own bed. The other involves a dwarven executioner, with broken arms, unable to use his hammer, delivering punishments by biting his victims and tearing off their limbs, keeping one in his mouth for years.

Tarn Adams considers ''Dwarf Fortress'' his life's work, and has stated in 2011 that he does not expect version 1.0 to be released for at least another twenty years, and even after that, he would still continue to update it. Adams calls his game an open-ended "story generator". The game's code base is [[wikipedia: closed source|proprietary]], and Adams has stated he has no plans to release it into the [[wikipedia: open source|open source]] domain, citing the risk of them going into financial trouble. He acknowledged the role of the community in supporting its development and has endorsed third-party tools, visualizers and interface code. He explained he would consider releasing its source if he could not maintain it anymore, seeing different game developers taking it up. He says that he does not mind any modifications as long as he is not put into risk.

Adams describes version 1.0 having an Adventure mode that would be a regular role-playing game, with changing plots and ordering subordinates to perform various tasks. Fortress mode would have a closer relationship with the outside generated world through war, trade and diplomacy. The world being bigger; he envisions the game to have many more features like magic, a tutorial, and a better interface. According to him, a tutorial is a burden because of the additional need of updating it. He said of version 1.0, "sitting down with a fresh DF world would be like sitting down to read a middling fantasy author you haven't read before, but with all the extras that being a video game provides, including the ability to write your own sequels." Modern in-game technologies and 3D graphics were fan requests Adams said he would never implement, yet showing ambivalence about the latter if the task was easy enough.

January 29, 2020 saw [[DF2014:Release_information/0.47.01|the last major release]] prior to the premium edition, partially adding villains and their plots, planned to be completed after the premium release.

===Premium version (2020–Present)===
[[File:DF steam logo.jpg|thumb|Steam release]]
In March of 2019, indie game studio [[wikipedia: Kitfox Games|Kitfox Games]] announced that they would be helping Bay 12 create a version of ''Dwarf Fortress'' for release on Steam and Itch.io with graphics, additional music, and a completely reworked UI. A sudden family health crisis, combined with the rising costs of healthcare and the instability of a Patreon-based income, made the Adamses reconsider their previous stances about remaining aloof from the games industry.
