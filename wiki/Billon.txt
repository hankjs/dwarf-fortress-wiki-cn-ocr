'''Billon''' is an alloy of equal parts [[silver]] and [[copper]]. Historically, billon was used to mint [[coins]], but it remains to be seen if billon coins will be useful when the [[dwarven economy]] is re-developed. 

Two billon bars can be made at a [[smelter]] from 1 silver [[bar]] and 1 copper bar, which does not create an increase in value. However, eight billon bars can be created by smelting 1 silver-bearing [[ore]] and 1 copper-bearing ore.  Since [[tetrahedrite]] counts as both types of ore, two tetrahedrite nuggets can yield eight bars of billon for a roughly 70% increase in value over smelting the tetrahedrite nuggets separately. This recipe will only be used when no other silver-bearing ores are available to the [[smelter]], otherwise [[silver|silver nugget]]s or [[galena]] ore will be used as the silver-bearing ore, though tetrahedrite can still serve as the copper-bearing ore.

== Notes ==
Unlike both of its constituent metals, billon cannot be used to forge weapons or ammunition. Billon can be used to make moderately valuable furniture and other objects at a [[Metalsmith's forge]]. Be aware, however, that it is not [[magma-safe]].
