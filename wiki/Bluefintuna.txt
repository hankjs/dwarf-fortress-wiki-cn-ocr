'''Bluefin tuna''' are a species of large [[Creature|fish]] who can be found in all types of [[ocean]]. Ten times the size of a [[dwarf]], they provide a great amount of returns when [[butcher]]ed. As non-[[vermin]] fish, bluefin tuna can't be fished by [[Fisherdwarf|fisherdwarves]], but can be caught with the use of a [[drowning chamber]]. Infant bluefin tuna are called ''bluefin fry''.

Some dwarves [[Preferences|like]] bluefin tuna for their ''finlets''.
