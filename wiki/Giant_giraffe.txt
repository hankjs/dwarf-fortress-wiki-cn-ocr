'''Giant giraffes''' are gargantuan versions of the [[giraffe]], a long-necked [[grazer]] found roaming [[savage]] [[tropical]] [[savanna]]s and [[shrubland]]s. Being a [[giant animal|giant creature]], giant giraffes provide an absurd amount of (extremely valuable, being 5x the value of common [[domestic animal]]s) [[butchering]] returns, but also are an animal that you do not want [[Creature#Agitation|agitated]].

Giant giraffes also make decent [[exotic pet]]s, but their real value lies as a staple of the [[meat industry]].

Due to an error, giant giraffes walk far slower than they can stroll. Their strolling speed is equal to 60 kph, much greater than either their trot or canter speed. As a consequence, giant giraffes are very difficult to chase, as they will never get tired from maintaining this speed. They may also sneak at this speed without suffering penalty to their stealth, but will likely never abuse this in game.

Some dwarves [[Preferences|like]] giant giraffes for their ''hump''. They are notable for having a different prefstring than their base animal.
