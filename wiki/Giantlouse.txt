Just like normal [[Louse|lice]], '''giant lice''' are not bloodsucking parasites, for now. Giant lice are regular giant ground insects, although they lack an attack other than [[push|pushing]] and wrestling. Like all other insects, their max age is very short. They are lacking [LARGE_PREDATOR] token and will mostly leave your dwarves alone.

{{D for Dwarf}}

Considering the size of the normal louse and the size of the giant louse (200,000 times bigger), and, furthermore, that an external parasite must be much, much smaller than its host, one wonders what manner of abnormally colossal, yet unknown beasts this insect sucks the blood of. If the proportionality is still valid, these beasts should be at least ten times the size of an adult dragon.

Giant Lice should not be confused with bankers, which wear suits.
