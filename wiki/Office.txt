[[File:office_icon_preview.png|right]]An '''office''' (called a study in some game menus) is a [[zone]] required by certain [[nobles]] and administrators. Some higher-ranking nobles require a "throne room" - the same thing, just fancier. You can simply designate an office from the zone menu. An office requires a [[throne]] or [[chair]] and does not (necessarily) have to be a separate enclosed space separated from other areas by walls and a [[door]].

Note that if you assign an office to a dwarf, sometimes they will eat a meal in their office, and complain about the lack of [[table]]s - to avoid this thought, put a table next to the chair in said office.

Depending on the [[Zone#Quality_and_value|zone value]], offices get a rank:

==Reducing Office Space==
A "meager office" can consist of a 1-tile-diameter area designated from a single chair as a study/office, and assigned to a particular dwarf ([[File:UI add worker.png|28px]]). You will probably first encounter this need in the [[bookkeeper]] or the [[manager]] - assigning one of the chairs in the dining room for them is perfectly acceptable.

If you put a table next to the office chair and designate it as a dining room as well, both rooms will be used like they are supposed to - however, overlapping rooms drop considerably in value rating, making it harder to meet demands by higher-ranking nobles. While this can be countered with high-value [[furniture]] (artifacts are very helpful), actual individual areas, designated separately from other areas (whether or not separated by walls) are the easier way to meet demands.
