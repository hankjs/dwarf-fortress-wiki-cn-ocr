'''Potash maker''' is a skill associated with the '''potash making''' [[labor]].

Any dwarf with the potash maker labor enabled can use a unit of either [[ash]] or [[lye]] to produce [[potash]] at an [[ashery]], which can then be used to [[grower|fertilize]] [[crop]]s or to contribute to the [[glass industry]] after further refining to [[pearlash]] at a [[kiln]].

As potash does not carry a quality level, increasing one's potash maker skill level only affects production speed. Skilled potash makers are often associated with uselessness; when referring to expendable peons, players will often refer to them as "Urist McPotashmaker".
