'''Iron men''' are dangerous and exceptionally rare inorganic [[construct creature]]s made out of [[iron]], who inhabit the third layer of the [[caverns]]. Like other inorganic construct creatures, they are non-sentient, [[No Pain|feel no pain]], fear or [[No Exert|exertion]], [[No Stun|cannot be stunned]] and don't need to breathe. They are as large as [[human]]s and are level 2 [[building destroyer]]s. Iron men are immortal and only die to violence.

Iron men are not as tough as you'd expect, the reason being the fact they are actually hollow: they have an iron exterior layer and an interior gas layer, making them far more fragile than a fully metallic creature such as the [[bronze colossus]], and even [[dwarf]] nails can damage the iron. Iron men are unharmed by [[fire]] and [[magma]], but can be damaged by [[dragonfire]] just like regular iron items. Additionally, iron men will, when damaged, leak a poisonous gas which causes a [[syndrome]] called "iron man cough", consisting of coughing up [[blood]]. Dwarves with standard disease resistance will experience a peak in coughing shortly (100 [[time|time units]]) after infection, and will recover in less than a game day (1000 time units out of a full day's 1200 time units). These periods will vary according to the disease resistance of the infected dwarf, but the disease is not life-threatening. (Unless, of course, [[thought|being sick]] is the straw that breaks the camel's back of your dwarf's [[insanity|sanity]].)

Upon death, iron men become a masterwork iron [[statue]] of themselves. Parts like thumbs and noses removed from the creature during combat may be [[melt item|melted]] at a [[smelter]] in order to produce a small amount of iron.

Some dwarves [[Preferences|like]] iron men for their ''stern appearance''.

===Creature behavior and origin===

<!-- Reference: Bender, character from "Futurama" animated TV series -->
Surprisingly, the Iron Man does not deplete your fortress' [[alcohol|booze]] supplies, nor does it woo nearly all of your female dwarves or hold a grudge against your [[Hammerer]].

<!-- Reference: Iron Man, Marvel Comics superhero -->
On rare occasions, humans who exhibit strange moods may sometimes turn into one of these. However, dwarves have been unable to duplicate this process, even given the finest workshops and crafting materials, leading most dwarven scholars to declare it impossible for a human to do so in a cave, with a box of scraps. !!EDIT!! The scholars are now running around naked, on account of losing a bet.

<!-- Reference: Iron Man, Marvel Comics superhero, "Jarvis I Need Karma" -->
Iron men are also known to frequently make use of automated machinery in order to try and artificially gain divine goodwill.

It's unknown if the creature's metallic nature is a result of travelling through a magnetic field, or if it is capable of time travel. However, it's certain that it's made completely of iron, with no components of other metals or alloys like lead or steel. It will, however, still seek to fill your dwarves full of dread.
