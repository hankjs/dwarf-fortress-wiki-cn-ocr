Elks are large, '''giant elks''' are [[Giant animal|larger]]. At more than twice the size of a [[giraffe]], giant elks are formidable creatures, appearing in groups of 4-7 in [[temperate]] [[grassland]]s and [[tundra]]s. Despite this, giant elks are a relatively safe prey for your hunters, being benign creatures that most of the time will simply flee instead of putting up a fight. The males have antlers, but they cannot use these for goring. Their young are called ''fawns''.

Elk can be captured in [[cage]] [[trap]]s and [[Animal trainer|trained]] into exotic [[pet]]s. 
Being large [[grazer]]s, giant elks need large grassy [[pasture]]s not to starve to death. This makes them difficult to keep, but this is made up for by their large size, still making them very viable targets for a [[meat industry]]. While there are [[elephant|larger]] [[giant rhinoceros|creatures]] in the game, giant elks are the biggest game found in their respective biomes, barring the very dangerous [[giant polar bear]]s in tundras and unbutcherable [[ogre]]s in [[surroundings#evil|terrifying]] grasslands.

Male giant elks are one of the few creatures in the game that give [[horn]]s (called antlers) when butchered. However, since several of the other horn-givers are [[domestic animal]]s, most forts have little need for additional horns. Still, this means more material for making [[craft]]s. They also give [[hoof|hooves]] when butchered. Both horn and hoof crafts are made by a [[bone carver]].
Despite being larger than their smaller cousins, giant elks give exactly the same amount of [[horn]] and [[hoof]] material as those when butchered. Products made from elk parts are worth [[Multiply value|twice]] more than those made from other, more common animals.

Giant elks are exotic [[mount]]s, and can sometimes arrive with [[elf|elves]] in [[siege]]s.

Some dwarves [[Preferences|like]] giant elks for their ''grace''.
