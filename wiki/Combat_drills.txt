[[dwarf|Dwarves]] that are part of a [[squad]] that is not currently ordered into "combat mode" (''kill {monster}/station {location}'') will "Train" when they have nothing else to do. If there is no one else to train with a Dwarf will initiate an "Individual Combat Drill". (Soldiers with "self-motivated" in their personality will often initiate Individual Combat Drills when inactive as well.)  In order for this to happen you must have either a [[Barracks]] ([[zone]]d from a [[bed]]/[[cabinet]]) or an Armory (zoned from a [[Weapon rack]]/[[Armor stand]]) and set it to "train" mode (using {{k|t}}).

By default, all squads are set to 'Active/Train' alert, in which they are assigned to train [[calendar|the entire year]]. To change this, go to [[Scheduling|alert]] screen ({{k|m}} {{k|a}}), select the new alert you want to set, then use right arrow to switch to squad listing and press {{k|enter}} to change the alert for the highlighted squad. Alternatively, you can use {{k|s}} from the game main menu, then select the squad you want to edit via its assigned letter, and repeatedly press {{k|t}} to cycle through the alerts.

While [[Squads#Equipping_Soldiers|equipped]] with a [[weapon]], practice in [[Shield user]] and [[Dodging]] will occur magnitudes slower, if at all.  If you are trying to practice [[skills]] for survival, it may be a good idea to drill with no weapon at all for a while.

Successful sparring will generate combat log [[reports]], showing the {{Raw Tile|S|3:7:1}} flag in main view for new sparring reports (similar to hunting reports).

If your military is standing around only doing Individual Combat Drills, double-check the steps above and ensure that you have a barracks set to train, you have a training schedule set up, and the squad is set to follow that schedule in the [[Scheduling|alert]] screen ({{k|m}} {{k|a}}).
