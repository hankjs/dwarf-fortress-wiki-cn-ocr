'''Sand pear''' is one of the many genera of [[tree]]s found above ground. Like the vast majority of above ground trees, sand pear [[wood]] is brown and produces brown products.

Sand pear trees bear sand pears that can be harvested by setting up a gathering [[zone]]. They can be eaten raw, cooked, and brewed into delicious [[alcohol|sand pear cider]]. So, you may consider exploiting them rather than chopping them down to make [[charcoal]].

Some [[Dwarf|dwarves]] [[Preferences|like]] sand pear trees for their ''fruit''.
