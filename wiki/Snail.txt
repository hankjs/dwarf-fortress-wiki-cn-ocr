'''Snails''' are a species of [[hateable]] [[vermin]] who may be found in any non-freezing [[biome]]. They will cause unhappy [[thought]]s on [[Dwarf|dwarves]] who absolutely detest them should they encounter one. They possess a [[pet]] value of 10, but may not be caught in [[animal trap]]s.

Some dwarves [[Preferences|like]] snails for their ''shells''.
