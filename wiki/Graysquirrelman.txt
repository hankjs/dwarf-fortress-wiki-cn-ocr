'''Gray squirrel men''' are [[animal people]] variants of the common [[gray squirrel]] who can be found in [[savage]] [[temperate]] [[forest]]s. They spawn in groups of anywhere between 1-5 individuals and are generally content to keep to themselves. In terms of size, they are a little over half the weight of the average dwarf. All gray squirrel men are born with Legendary [[skill]] in [[climbing]].

Like other savage animal people, they can join [[civilization]]s, become [[historical figure]]s, appear as [[visitor]]s and be playable in [[adventurer mode]].

Some dwarves [[Preferences|like]] gray squirrel men for their ''tails''.
