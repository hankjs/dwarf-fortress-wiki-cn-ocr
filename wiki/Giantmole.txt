'''Giant moles''' are [[creature]]s found at the first two layers of the [[caverns]], who'll come to your fortress and attempt to [[Steals food|steal your food]] and [[Steals drink|drink your alcohol]], and so should be kept away from your [[food]] [[stockpile]]s. While large, giant moles are benign and will not start fights on their own. However, due to their thieving disposition, [[dwarves]] will react aggressively to their presence and often attack them on sight. Caution should be taken if a giant mole enters a populated area, as they can cause significant damage in the event they fight back. A giant mole infant is called a ''giant mole pup''. Despite the fact that they are members of [[wikipedia:Eulipotyphla|Eulipotyphla]], they have teeth like a rodent. 

Due to their thieving behavior, giant moles are easily lured into [[trap]]s by using food stockpiles as bait. If captured in [[cage]]s, they can be [[Animal trainer|trained]] into valuable [[pet]]s. However, due to their very short lifespan, giant moles make poor long-term companions to dwarves and are better off being sold away or [[butcher]]ed for a nice amount of returns. Products made from giant mole parts are worth twice more than those made from common domestic animals. 

Some dwarves [[Preferences|like]] giant moles for their ''noses''.
