'''Drunians''' are [[wolf]]-sized [[creature]]s who can be found on the first and second layers of the [[caverns]]. They spawn in loose groups of 5-10 individuals, walking into undefended fortresses, [[Steals items|stealing items]] and [[Steals food|eating all the food]] they can get their grubby fingers into. Drunians are near the size of the average [[dwarf]], but will flee when confronted unless cornered, in which case they will fight back with bites and scratches which should not pose a threat to a [[military]] squad. All drunians are born with Legendary [[skill]] in [[Climber|climbing]].

Drunians can be captured with [[cage]] [[trap]]s and [[Animal trainer|trained]] into low-value [[pet]]s. They are long-lived and also rather explosive breeders, which makes them an attractive target for your [[meat industry]]. They reach adulthood at 2 years, and should preferably be [[butcher]]ed at that age for optimal returns.

Unlike most animals, drunians can't be spawned in the [[object testing arena]].

Some dwarves [[Preferences|like]] drunians for their ''manes''.
