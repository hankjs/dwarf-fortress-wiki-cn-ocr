'''Masked lovebird men''' are [[animal people]] variants of the common [[masked lovebird]] who inhabit [[savage]] [[tropical]] [[forest]]s. They spawn in groups of anywhere between 5-10 individuals and are generally content to keep to themselves. In terms of size, they are a little over half the weight of the average [[dwarf]]. All masked lovebird men are born with Legendary [[skill]] in [[Climber|climbing]].

Like other savage animal people, masked lovebird men can join [[civilization]]s, become [[historical figure]]s, appear as [[visitor]]s and be playable in [[adventurer mode]].

Some dwarves [[Preferences|like]] masked lovebird men for their ''loving nature''.
