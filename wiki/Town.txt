A '''town''' is a large [[site]] founded by [[human]] civilizations. Towns start out from [[hamlet]]s, which can transform into a town if there are no other nearby sites with a market. [[Road]]s link towns between other nearby towns and dwarven [[fortress]]es, as well as sites conquered by humans.

The population and size can be determined by the map symbol representing it:
* [[File:Icon site city 1.png]] / {{Raw Tile|+|7:0}} : ≤999
* [[File:Icon site city 2.png]] / {{Raw Tile|*|7:0}} : 1,000-1,999
* [[File:Icon site city 3.png]] / {{Raw Tile|#|7:0}} : 2,000-9,999
* [[File:Icon site city 4.png]] / {{Raw Tile|☼|7:1}} : ≥10,000

[[Adventure mode|Adventurers]] spend much quality time in towns - they can come to trade, speak, or entertain the townspeople, and occasionally to slay those who have invited their wrath. Towns' [[tavern]]s are a popular destination for many adventurers; they are the only sources of alcohol in human settlements and provide excellent entertainment, which includes [[performance]]s and the occasional drunken brawl. Other people of interest include:

* [[mercenary|mercenaries]], who will gather at [[tavern]]s, and make for great traveling companions.
* [[criminal]]s, who may be the target of quests
* [[priest]]s and [[monk]]s, [[guild|craftsmen]], and [[counting house|merchants]], who may have traveled the world, and may be embroiled in all sorts of [[intrigue]].

== Keep ==
At the heart of a town is a walled stronghold, garrisoned by many soldiers. Inside of the keep can be found a lord or lady, other high nobility, and men-at-arms willing to follow you unto death. If the town is the civ's seat of power, then the law-maker will also reside here.

Since .47.01, keeps have had their households expanded – most human keeps will have a variety of members, some familiar from fort mode, like doctors and executioners, and others related to the expanded city, like judges, fire commissioners and sewer administrators, and yet others just plain household staff, like the housekeepers and chefs. The vast majority of these don't have interesting game mechanics associated with them tied to their positions, but many of them are caught up in some [[intrigue|scheme]].

== The town proper ==
[[File:v50_town.png|thumb|300px|right|A town seen through the travel screen.]]
[[File:town_preview.jpg|thumb|300px|right|center|You could smell the bakery through the image.<br><small>''Art by KlausPillon''</small>]]

Outside of the keep is the realm of the bourgeoisie. Commuters and travelers walk among the densely-packed houses and shops in narrow streets, while stray domesticated animals roam the muddy alleyways and pastures. Vast shopping districts are major trade centers. Other buildings include warehouses (which can be ransacked without repercussion) and wells. Common structures include [[tavern]]s and [[temple]]s, but [[Library|libraries]] are very rare.

Below is a list of different shops and markets found in a town. Most towns do not have every single retail good available, and adventurers may have to travel to a different town in order to browse wares of a particular type. The shops that are "common" are common because only animal products (meat, bone, leather) and farm products (cloth and food) are produced in any significant numbers. Stone, wood, and metal are all extremely rare materials in towns, and because of this, few industries based upon these materials will spring up. An exception is the leather goods shop, which is rare compared to other leather shops.

Common shops:

In a market, one can find:
* Imported goods/food/clothing
* [[Meat]]
* Fruit and vegetables
* [[Cheese]]
* Processed goods

== Subterranean ==
Below a town are two subterranean structures: [[catacombs]] and [[sewer]]s. Both can be present at once, frequently connecting and overlapping each other. [[Tomb]]s may also be present alongside catacombs. Criminals, outcasts of society and various subterranean creatures hide in the dark passages. They are common destinations for those looking to finish a [[quest]], gain [[reputation]], or search for valuable loot.

Catacombs reside below temples, and are almost always present - sewers, on the other hand, can only be found in more developed towns. The presence of a sewer in a town can be confirmed by the presence of [[floor grate]]s in the middle of streets – accessible via small and elusive entrances above-ground, or by diving below nearby waterways.

== Destroyed or abandoned towns ==
:''Further information: [[Ruin]]''
[[File:Destroyed.jpg|thumb|center|1000px|Legends mode entry about a town being sacked]]

In time, whether by war, beasts, a genocidal adventurer, or some other disaster, towns will be brought to ruin. Ruined towns are typically desolate wastelands of abandoned and destroyed buildings and structures. Shops and markets are typically bare, but occasionally some goods can still be left for you to steal. [[Bandit]]s and criminals may still lurk in the streets, and some may even make the ruins their home, if some supernatural creature or monster hasn't made themselves cozy already.
