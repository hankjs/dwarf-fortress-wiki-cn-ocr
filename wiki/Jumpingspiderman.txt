'''Jumping spider men''' are [[animal people]] variants of the common [[jumping spider]], who can inhabit most [[savage]] [[biome]]s. They spawn in groups of 1-3 individuals and are generally content to keep to themselves, but may pick fights if provoked. In terms of size, they are a little over half the weight of the average [[dwarf]].

Like other savage animal people, jumping spider men can join [[civilization]]s, become [[historical figure]]s, appear as [[visitor]]s and be playable in [[adventurer mode]]. They feel no fear or [[No Pain|pain]] and [[No Stun|can't be stunned]], and their three pairs of arms allow them to carry multiple [[weapon]]s and [[shield]]s at once.

Some dwarves [[Preferences|like]] jumping spider men for their ''striking appearance'' and their ''ability to leap''.

Why don't YOU guess what goes here? Guess. Just guess.

Incidentally, the ASCII character '{{tile|j|0:0:1}}' looks like a person jumping forwards!

It is currently unknown whether jumping spider women throw tea parties or hold bake sales.
