'''Beast hunters''' are [[visitor]]s that will visit and [[petition]] to stay in order to slay [[creature]]s in your above-ground [[surroundings]]. They may arrive in your fortress at any time, regardless of whether the fort has any [[location]]s. Their subterranean counterparts are the [[monster slayer]]s.

==Behavior==
Beast hunters arrive with their own [[weapon]]s and [[armor]], as well as some degree of basic [[combat skill]]. If you accept their service, they will live among your dwarves like regular citizens, although they will spend all of their time either loitering around [[meeting hall]]s or prowling the surface, looking for animals to kill. Beast hunters cannot be assigned any labors, will not [[haul]] anything, and cannot be given orders, or be controlled by [[burrow]]s or other means-they're equivalent to a fortress' own [[hunter]]s in behavior, though unlike those latter, they won't immediately flee combat due to running out of [[crossbow]] [[bolt]]s if they're wielding melee weapons. 

Allowing these visitors to regularly rampage through your surface domains will, occasionally, produce free [[meat]], [[bone]], and [[hide]]s; however, because you can't direct them to kill particular units, they may decide to pick a fight with something useless, like a flock of [[buzzard]]s, or rush headlong into battle with a [[giant elephant]] who can stomp them flat in a second. They are also often poorly suited to a life of combat; some may arrive who hate all things military and panic at the first sign of violence, while others have ineffectual skills which will inevitably end with them being killed by the animals they're supposed to be hunting. Consider exiling beast hunters who seem like they're destined for tantrums, or arrange "accidents" for them if they happen to be carrying interesting equipment. [[Steel]] is steel, after all.

==Considerations==

The efficiency of beast hunters is tied to where your fortress is settled; a calm environment where the most common animals are [[barn owl]]s and [[kiwi]]s is unlikely to bring you a great deal of results, but more dangerous areas inhabited by either larger or [[fanciful]] creatures may bring better results. Of course, if your surroundings are inhabited by, for example, [[undead]] [[giant tiger]]s, then the hunters will only really serve as a distraction at best. Having them around allows you to hunt the surface without much micromanaging, but for dealing with actual dangerous beasts, a proper dwarven [[military]] [[squad]] is preferred.
