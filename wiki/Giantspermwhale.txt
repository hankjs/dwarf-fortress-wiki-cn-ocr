'''Giant sperm whales''' are ''really, REALLY'' [[Giant animal|giant]] – they are even bigger than a real-world blue whale. They produce truly enormous stacks of animal products, which can reach over 13,000 total units' worth of food; [[butcher]]ing one will feed a 100-dwarf fortress for a bit more than ten years—if the corpse doesn't rot halfway to the butcher's shop, of course. Giant sperm whales are the [[List_of_creatures_by_adult_size#end_of_list|largest creatures]] in the game by a wide margin; they are eight times the size of a [[dragon]], ten times that of a [[bronze colossus]], about 380 times the size of a fully-grown bull [[moose]], and about 3,330 times the size of a measly [[dwarf]].

[[Hunter|Hunting]] giant sperm whales is not easy due to their [[aquatic]] nature (and their sheer size). They can be captured with a [[drowning chamber|fish-catching chamber]] and then air-drowned; a giant sperm whale out of water will quickly turn into a corpse. They will also occasionally [[beaching|beach]] themselves, leaving a corpse ready for the butchering by lucky dwarves.

If you happen to embark on a [[surroundings|Terrifying]] ocean, you may run into [[undead]] versions of these. If you do, pray Armok will have mercy, because these things will have none. Be sure to tell the forum how much [[fun]] you had!

Like normal sperm whales, giant sperm whales have a 1/101 chance of being born with [[wikipedia:Moby-Dick|white skin]] instead of the usual gray.

Some dwarves [[preference|admire]] giant sperm whales for their ''vengeful nature'' and their ''teeth''.

{{D for Dwarf}}

It is rumored that giant sperm whales can only be slain by throwing iron spears into their heads. Giant sperm whales also tend to rip off limbs for no reason, and thereafter the surviving dwarf may start a grudge with the whale that may spell doom for dozens of dwarves.
