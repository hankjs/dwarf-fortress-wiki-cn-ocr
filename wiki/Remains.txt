[[File:remains_sprite_preview.png|right]]The [[corpse]]s of non-fish [[vermin]] are called '''remains'''. Unhappy dwarves in a macabre [[strange mood]] will sometimes request vermin remains to construct their [[artifact]]s. Remains cannot be [[butcher]]ed, and are not otherwise useful.

Creatures with {{token|HUNTS_VERMIN|c}}, notably [[cat]]s, will kill vermin, leaving the remains scattered around the fort. (Cats who have adopted a dwarf seem to drag the remains of vermin they kill to their <s>owner</s> slave). While this prevents unhappy [[thoughts]] from [[vermin#Hateable vermin|hateable vermin]], it can also cause areas of your fort to become littered with remains if not properly [[stockpile#Refuse|taken care of]]; even as tiny as they are, remains are capable of blocking doors from closing, which can sometimes cause problems.

[[Honey bee]]s, for example, will leave behind remains after stinging.

With time, certain remains may rot away, depending on what they are composed of. Unlike corpses, remains do not cause miasma or leave [[bone]]s upon full decomposition; they simply disappear. Remains are stored in a [[stockpile#Refuse|refuse stockpile]], subject to [[standing orders]] refuse settings.

[[Night troll]]s have vermin remains on tables or in cauldrons, because they have the habit ({{token|HABIT|c|COOK_VERMIN}}).
