'''Siliceous ooze''' is one of the several types of [[soil]] that can be found on the floors of deep [[ocean]]s. Not surprisingly, such layers occasionally contain an [[aquifer]].

Siliceous ooze is a type of pelagic sediment. It is formed by the silica in diatoms and other microorganisms, as opposed to [[calcareous ooze]], which is formed by particles of [[flux|calcium carbonate]].
