'''Peregrine falcon men''' are humanoid versions of the common [[peregrine falcon]] and a [[Creature|species]] of [[animal people]], found in most [[savage]] [[biome]]s. They are only a little over half the size of an adult [[dwarf]] and retain many characteristics from their non-humanoid cousins, including diving from the sky to hunt [[vermin]] and an exceptional flight speed - peregrine falcon men are the fastest fliers of all animal people, moving at the maximum [[gait]] of 87 kph. Unlike normal falcons, a male peregrine falcon man is not called a tiercel peregrine. All peregrine falcon men are born with Legendary [[skill]] in [[Climber|climbing]].

Like other savage animal people, peregrine falcon men may occasionally join [[civilization]]s, becoming full-fledged citizens who may appear in your fortress as [[visitor]]s or be playable in [[adventurer mode]]. Their incredible flight speed makes them an attractive choice for an adventurer when flight speed is a priority.

Some dwarves [[Preferences|like]] peregrine falcon men for their ''ability to dive through the air''.

{{D for Dwarf}}
When engaged in combat, peregrine falcon men will demand their foes "Come on!" and "Show me your moves!" at any given opportunity.
Their preferable style of combat is throwing punches of immense strength at their unfortunate opponent.
