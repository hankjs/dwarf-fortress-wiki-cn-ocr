'''Chalk''' is a [[flux]] [[stone]] found in the [[sedimentary layer]]. As such, it is worth twice as much as most other stones. 
Despite chalk's rather chalky nature in real life, [[furniture]] and [[Finished goods|crafts]] made out of chalk in ''Dwarf Fortress'' last as long as [[granite]] ones. 
Chalk is '''not''' a [[magma-safe]] material.

==In Real Life==
Chalk, a soft white sedimentary rock, is a form of [[limestone]] composed of the mineral [[calcite]]. It often contains [[chert]] and minor amounts of [[silt]] and [[clay]].

{{D for Dwarf}}

Unlike in real life, dwarves cannot consume chalk [[slab|tablets]] to [[vomit|settle their stomachs]].
