[[File:instrument_sprite_preview.png|right]]An '''instrument''' {{Tile|¿|7:1}}  is a procedurally-generated item used by [[performer]]s for making music in [[tavern]]s and [[temple]]s.
__TOC__

Instruments come in four types, defined by the [[skill]] necessary for playing one: [[Keyboardist|keyboard]], [[Stringed instrumentalist|stringed]], [[Wind instrumentalist|wind]], and [[Percussionist|percussion]]. Some instruments are made in a single step like other [[finished goods]], however many instruments are assembled from multiple individual components. For example, a bell might be one-piece, but a pipe organ would have a keyboard, pipes, bellows, and a body to support it all. 

Instruments can be either small enough to be hand-held by a dwarf or so large that they are considered "stationary". Stationary instruments are built from the [[furniture]] menu with the {{menu icon|b|f|i}} command. Hand-held instruments can be carried around by dwarves or placed in [[coffer]]s in [[tavern]]s or [[temple]]s, where they can be used for performances. But regardless of size of the instrument, they are (currently) always quite light (weighing at most a few Γ), whereas the instrument parts (of unassembled) instruments can be quite heavy. Also all instruments (even huge stationary ones) can be stored in bins.

=== Instrument names ===
There are no standardized instruments or names for them, nor are there intended to be. For any new game, specific instruments are semi-randomly generated at [[world generation]] (both their names and the details of any components they are built of), and are usually specific to each [[civilization]].  So, the stone triangle your dwarves have in this fortress will almost certainly not be the stone triangle you have in the next fortress, nor the one that other civilizations have either (and so attempting to look up specific instrument names in the ''DwarfFortressWiki'' {{k|Search}} will not give any useful information). This can make remembering the various instruments a challenge - a notepad or equivalent may be handy.

Traders may bring individual components for other instruments from their civilizations, but you will be unable to assemble them into instruments unless your dwarves have the necessary knowledge for that specific instrument.  In theory, a dwarf can play any instrument if it is complete (but see "usage", below – they may never want/need to).

In order to find out what instruments are available to your fortress, start by going to any [[craftsdwarf's workshop]] and look under the {{k|Add new task / Make instrument (piece)}} section. It will show ''most'' of the available instruments, either as a whole instrument or some individual component. Choosing then to select a specific "material" will give you an idea what sort of material the instrument (or that part) is made from, a further clue to what sort of instrument it may be. Many instruments require multiple components, often made at other workshops, which then must be assembled at the craftsdwarf's workshop. Go to the other 5 workshops (listed [[Instrument#Components|below]]) for additional instruments and/or parts. 

Selecting and examining an actual individual instrument ''(the item, not the job listing in a workshop)'' will show a detailed description and material(s) required.

==Usage==
Dwarves will use instruments in taverns or temples only if they know a particular song or dance that requires their use.  If you see a dwarf with the job status "Simulate <*instrument name*>" then the dwarf would use that instrument if it were available. Note that due to a bug, musical compositions known to civilizations will use instruments from all civilizations of the same type. As a result, the more dwarven civilizations you have in your world, the less likely your citizens are to make use of instruments that you have produced yourself or have purchased from your civilization’s [[caravan]].

== Construction ==
Any instruments with a single component can be made directly. More complex ones require each instrument piece to first be made separately and then assembled into the final instrument. The option associated with them is "assemble <*instrument*>". Make a note of the name of the instrument and enter the work orders screen with {{menu icon|o}}. Clicking the button to create a new work order and typing the name of the instrument in the search box will show all the pieces required (possibly from other workshops). Single-piece instruments created at other workshops will not be listed in the craftsdwarf's shop; those can be found by checking the potential workshops or scrolling through possible jobs (by specific instrument name) in the [[work orders]] screen.

During a [[strange mood]], dwarves may create instruments which use improper materials and/or do not include the required components (e.g. a metal-bells-on-a-glass-stand instrument made from wood with spikes of leather).

===Components===
Many of the instruments/components are made in [[craftsdwarf's workshop]]s {{menu icon|b|o|r}}, however certain types of instruments or components may only be created in more specialized workshops:
:* [[carpenter's workshop]] {{menu icon|b|o|p}} for [[wood]] instruments/components
:* [[glass furnace]] {{menu icon|b|o|u|g}} for [[glass]] instruments/components
:* [[kiln]] {{menu icon|b|o|u|k}} for [[ceramic]] instruments/components
:* [[leather works]] {{menu icon|b|o|l|l}} for [[leather]] instruments/components
:* [[stoneworker's workshop]] {{menu icon|b|o|t}} for [[stone]] instruments/components
:* [[metalsmith's forge]] {{menu icon|b|o|i}} for [[metal]] instruments/components

Instruments and their components can be made out of a variety of materials, including [[wood]], [[bone]], [[shell]], [[stone]], [[silk]] [[thread]], [[plant fiber]] [[thread]], [[glass]], [[ceramic]]s, [[metal]], or [[leather]]. Out of those, thread and leather can only be used for components, not for a full instrument.

Instrument components are categorized as [[tool]]s. A stockpile for instrument components can be made by selecting "tools" under finished goods, and the appropriate materials.

The details menu [[File:Mag glass icon.png]] can be used to select the specific material for most instruments and components. However, ceramic and glass instrument jobs do not yet support the details menu; the potter will choose the material for ceramic instruments at random, and all glass instruments made in your fortress will be from [[green glass]] (although [[caravan]]s can bring glass instruments or instrument parts made out of other types of glass). Assembling the instrument after all the components are finished is performed in a craftsdwarf's workshop, and the skill needed to assemble it is defined by the material of the "main" part of the instrument (see "Components", below).

Below are tables of parts that instruments can have and what materials they may require. It should be noted that, for a given world, only one material type is possible for each specific component. Thus, if a given instrument uses a metal keyboard material, it cannot be made using any other materials. Shell is only rarely chosen as a material.

A completely assembled instrument has a very high [[Item value#Base values of items|base item value]] (50).  The [[quality]] of the overall item is determined by the quality of the "<u>main</u>" part of the instrument, from which the instrument takes its description, e.g. a ''superior quality black bronze <u>stelid</u>'''. The main part also determines which skill is used to assemble the instrument (bonecarving, glassmaking, leatherworking, metalcrafting, pottery, stonecrafting or woodcrafting).  Main parts are designated by an asterisk (*) in the table below.

: * refers to the "main" part of the instrument - see explanation, above.

==Realism==
{{D for Dwarf}}
Due to the procedurally-generated nature of the instruments, it can be expected to see some resemblance to certain real-world instruments such as organs, as many large stationary instruments will include metal pipes and various keyboards as components. It should also be noted that dwarven ingenuity can create instruments that could not be considered playable in the real world, such as this: a small hand-held percussion instrument consisting of a metal block. The "musician" shakes the block. The instrument has a single high pitch.

Due to the block's only means of producing this high pitch being the displacement of air as it is shaken, it can be inferred that the dwarf shakes the block at several kHz, ''in theory'' providing a great source of strength and endurance based [[cross-training]] for [[military]] dwarves.
