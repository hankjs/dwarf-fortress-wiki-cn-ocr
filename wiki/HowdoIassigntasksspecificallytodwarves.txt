This is not something you can actually do; What you do instead is tell each [[dwarf]] what types of [[jobs]] to take, and it will pick its own jobs from all the jobs that need to be done. Here is an elaboration:

You should {{key|v}}iew a dwarf's {{key|p}}references and {{key|l}}abor, in order to see a list of jobs. Select which jobs you want that dwarf to do, and deselect the jobs you want it not to do. For example, if you want a dwarf to mine all the time, select [[mining]] and turn off all other jobs (like the hauling jobs near the bottom of the list that are always on by default.) Then that dwarf will only do mining jobs, and as long as you have {{key|d}}esignated some area that needs to be mined, that dwarf will take care of it.

Some jobs are generated at [[workshop]]s. If you {{key|b}}uild a {{key|w}}orkshop for {{key|m}}asons, a dwarf with the [[Masonry]] labor activated will put it together for you. Once the workshop is assembled, you can look at it with the {{key|q}} key, and select a list of things you want built. For example, if you {{key|a}}dd a request for rock {{key|d}}oors to the list of things to be done at that workshop, a dwarf with the Masonry labor activated will come along and start making them. If you want him to do it sooner rather than later, be sure to deselect all his other labors besides Masonry (again, especially hauling.)

There is one way to get around this for certain tasks that originate from a {{key|w}}orkshop or other {{key|b}}uilt structure.  With a dwarven [[manager]] named, {{key|q}}uery a {{key|w}}orkshop and set its {{key|p}}rofile to a single dwarf.  From now on, all tasks that are queued at that {{key|w}}orkshop can only be handled by its named dwarf, whether or not they have the appropriate skill activated at the time.  Using the [[manager]] to queue a large job will assign jobs to random {{key|w}}orkshops of the appropriate type, but queued jobs are still limited to being executed by that shop's assigned worker only.  [[Strange mood]]s may disrupt this subtle order, but not permanently.

Tasks like Sand Collection from a [[glass furnace]] are free for any dwarf with the appropriate hauling skill activated, as is Capture a Live Land Animal from a [[kennel]] linked to the Trapping skill, rather than any {{key|p}}rofiled worker.
