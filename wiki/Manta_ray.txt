'''Manta rays''' are massive cartilaginous [[Creature#Aquatic|fish]] that can be found in [[tropical]] [[ocean]]s. At over two tons, adult manta rays are huge creatures, and as such will provide a great amount of returns if [[butcher]]ed. As fully-sized creatures, they can't be fished by [[Fisherdwarf|fisherdwarves]], but can be caught with a [[drowning chamber]]. An infant manta ray is called a ''manta ray pup''.

Being cartilaginous, manta rays won't give [[bone]]s if butchered (though they'll still provide a [[skull]]).

Some dwarves [[Preferences|like]] manta rays for their ''majesty''.
