{{file|prefs/colors.txt}}
The '''colors.txt''' file defines the [[color scheme]] used by DF, in standard RGB color code. The default settings can be found at ``data/init/colors.txt`` and can be changed by manually placing your own file at ``prefs/colors.txt``{{version|52.02}}; the location of the ``prefs`` [[Game folders and files|folder]] depends on the [[Settings#Portable mode|portable mode setting]] (there is also a ``data`` folder there, but if you put a ``data/init/colors.txt`` there it will not be read). Changes made to these files take effect the next time ''Dwarf Fortress'' is run, and apply to all worlds. Files in both ``data/init/`` and ``prefs/`` are read when ''Dwarf Fortress'' starts, in that order, with the last value read for an option being used.
