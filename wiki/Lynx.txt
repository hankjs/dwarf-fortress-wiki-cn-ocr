'''Lynx''' are rare and solitary [[creature]]s found exclusively in [[taiga]]s. While carnivorous, their relatively small [[size]] (smaller than the average [[dog]]) means they're unlikely to confront [[Dwarf|dwarves]], though they may pose a threat to small [[domestic animal]]s. No more than 3 lynx will exist in a single region before they're locally [[extinct]]. Their newborns are called ''cubs'', and all members of the species are born with Legendary [[skill]] in [[Climber|climbing]].

Lynx could be captured in [[cage]] [[trap]]s and [[Animal trainer|trained]] into exotic [[pet]]s. They can be further trained into war or hunting beasts, though fall short in utility due to being smaller than dogs, who are much more accessible. While products made from [[butcher]]ed lynx are worth [[Multiply value|thrice]] more than those made from common animal parts, their rarity and extremely low numbers make them poor targets for a [[meat industry]]. Lynx take 3 years to reach adulthood, far longer than most other animals of comparable size.

Some dwarves [[Preferences|like]] lynx for their ''ear tufts''.
