'''Hyena men''' are [[animal people]] variants of the common [[hyena]], who can be found in [[savage]] [[tropical]] grasslands. They spawn in groups of 5-10 individuals and are generally content to keep to themselves, but will fight back if provoked. In terms of size, they are about as large as the average [[dwarf]].

Like other savage animal people, they can join [[civilization]]s, become [[historical figure]]s, appear as [[visitor]]s and be playable in [[adventurer mode]]. Hyena men are able to wear [[human]]-sized and dwarf-sized [[equipment]], making them a rather good choice for adventurers.

Inversely, hyena men-sized [[clothes]] are able to fit most races in your fortress, making [[Textile industry|clothes production ]] for every dwarf, [[goblin]] and human much easier.

Some dwarves [[Preferences|like]] hyena men for their ''distinctive laugh'' and their ''coordinated hunting''.
