The '''flesh ball''' is an amphibious [[creature]], made entirely out of [[meat|muscle]] and [[blood]], that is quite slow on the ground. They appear in clusters of 2&ndash;5 in the third layer of the [[caverns]] and are as heavy as a [[human]], but they are harmless to [[dwarf|dwarves]], possessing no means of attacking but a weak [[push]] which will glance away from just about anything.

Flesh balls are featureless, skinless and boneless. As simple balls of muscle, they do not need to breathe or sleep, have no thought, cannot vomit, become dizzy, or be stunned, but are still easily killable anyway. They produce two pieces of meat when [[butcher]]ed. Flesh balls possess a [[pet]] value of 10, but lack the necessary tokens to be [[Animal trainer|trainable]]. They can't be spawned in the [[object testing arena]].

Some dwarves [[Preferences|like]] flesh balls for their ''warmth'' and their ''calming roundness''.
