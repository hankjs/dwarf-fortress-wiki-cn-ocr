'''Sandy clay''' is one of the many types of [[soil]] that can be found in [[soil layer]]s. [[Aquifer]]s are never present in sandy clay.

Despite its name, it can ''not'' be used as a source of [[sand]] for [[glassmaking]]; however, it can be used as a source of [[clay]] for production of [[earthenware]].
