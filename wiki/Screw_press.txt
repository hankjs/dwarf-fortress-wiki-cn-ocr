A '''screw press''' is a special workshop used to press liquids out of various substances and to press [[slurry]] into [[sheets]] of [[paper]]. 

Food-related jobs at the screw press consist of pressing [[seed]] pastes or fruit ([[olive]]s) to yield [[oil]] (which can then be made into [[soap]] or cooked), [[press cake|pressing cake]] (which can be cooked), and pressing honeycombs to yield [[honey]] (which can then be brewed into [[mead]]) and [[Wax|wax cake]] (which can be made into wax crafts). These jobs require the [[pressing]] skill.

Pressing seed paste or fruit into oil and honeycombs into honey require an empty [[jug]] to hold the resulting liquid.

Slurry may be pressed into sheets of paper at the screw press by a dwarf with the [[papermaking]] skill. Sheets of paper have quality levels, while other products at the screw press do not.

Constructing a screw press requires two [[mechanisms]] and is done through the Build menu {{menu icon|b|o|R}}.

== Bugs ==

* Screw presses sometimes do not allow the "press [[honeycomb]]" job to be added directly; adding the job via the [[manager]] interface should get the work started.
