'''Giant aardvarks''' are the [[Giant animal|giant]] [[Creature|cousins]] of the common [[aardvark]], found in [[savage]] [[tropical]] plains. Like their regular-sized brethren, they spawn individually and meander through the map, generally minding their own business. Despite being over 9 times the size of a [[dwarf]], giant aardvarks are just as benign as their smaller cousins and will flee if confronted, making them unlikely to pose a threat unless cornered by your [[hunter]]s.

Giant aardvarks can be captured with [[cage]] [[trap]]s and [[Animal trainer|trained]] into [[pet]]s, possessing the standard value of a giant creature. A breeding pair can be used for a fortress's [[meat industry]] somewhat more efficiently than normal aardvarks, as their larger size makes them drop a larger quantity of [[meat]], [[fat]] and [[bone]]s. Giant aardvarks are exotic [[mount]]s, so you may see [[elves]] riding them into battle in the event of a [[siege]].

Some dwarves [[Preferences|like]] giant aardvarks for their ''snout'' and their ''long ears''.
