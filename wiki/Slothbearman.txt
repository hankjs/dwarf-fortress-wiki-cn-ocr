'''Sloth bear men''' are [[animal people]] versions of the [[sloth bear]] who can be found in [[savage]] [[tropical]] [[forest]]s. They spawn in groups of 1-5 individuals and are generally content to keep to themselves, but may fight back if provoked. In terms of size, they are a little larger than the average [[human]]. They also possess the {{token|CURIOUSBEAST_GUZZLER}} [[creature token]], which means that they will wander towards exposed stockpiles of alcohol and drink it. Be careful, they can drink entire barrels in an instant!

Like other savage animal people, they can join [[civilization]]s, become [[historical figure]]s, appear as [[visitor]]s and be playable in [[adventurer mode]].

Some dwarves [[Preferences|like]] sloth bear men for their ''large floppy ears''.

{{D for Dwarf}}

Certain powerful human nobles take great offense at engravings depicting them as sloth bear men.
