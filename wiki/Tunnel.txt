[[File:DF tunnel.png|thumb|300px|An underground tunnel in the caverns with stairs leading down to a mountain halls. Ahead the way splits off to other dwarven sites under the mountains.]]

A '''tunnel''' is an underground [[dwarf|dwarven]] construction that connects generated [[fortress]]es and [[mountain halls]] together.

On maps tunnels are represented by black dashed lines or grey double lines in ASCII mode. The name of the tunnel may be seen when mousing over it on the embark map. There are both a [[Settings#Embark|setting]] and an [[Advanced_world_generation#Allow_Init_Options_to_Show_Tunnels|advanced world generation]] option to prevent the display of them on maps.

Tunnels are paved with [[rock]] [[block]] [[floor]]s with [[ramp]]s at elevation changes. They are located in the first [[cavern]] layer, and the sides are frequently open to the caverns.

Fortresses can be [[embark]]ed over tunnels. The tunnels are open at the edges of the embark, allowing easily accessible [[fun]], but they can be blocked off by constructing [[wall]]s and/or raising [[bridge]]s.

Tunnels are the most convenient way for [[adventure mode|adventurer]]s to travel underground. Fast travel is allowed along them, unlike other underground areas. They may provide a path between dwarven mountain halls and the surface via fortresses. 

While travelling through the tunnel, you may stumble upon [[divine equipment|certain]] [[demon|surprises]] from exposed [[unusual volcanic wall|geodes]]. This can be [[exploit]]ed by offloading the area and revisiting it again, which will respawn the treasure. {{bug|13175}}

Tunnels are built during the [[world generation]], like [[road]]s. In [[legends]], viewing the history of dwarven civilizations will mention tunnels they've constructed. Tunnel names will include words like ''cave'', ''deep'', ''passage'', ''corridor'', and ''hall''. Unlike roads, there are not separately constructed or named bridges.
