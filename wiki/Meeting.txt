[[Noble]] dwarves need to schedule occasional meetings with representatives from the homelands and foreign diplomats. Meetings generally begin when the seasonal caravan arrives; merchants and traders usually have a [[diplomat]] accompanying them. Diplomats will meet with the expedition leader, mayor, baron, count, duke, or king, whichever is of highest rank. The foreigner will follow the relevant dwarf around the fortress until the meeting is finished; if your nobles have a lot of labors turned on, the meeting might take several months to conclude. 

If the dwarf has an [[office]], the meeting will take place there; a high-quality office will give the dwarf who scheduled the meeting a happy thought, while a poor office will upset the dwarf. If the dwarf does not have an office, the meeting will take place in a [[meeting hall]], which is to say, a dining room that has the "Meeting Hall" option turned on. Meeting in public sometimes embarrasses the dwarf, who receives an unhappy thought from having to conduct a meeting in such circumstances. Also, if your leader is taken by a [[strange mood]] during the meeting, the diplomat will leave unhappy. 

Unhappy civilians sometimes schedule their own meetings with the leader in order to yell at him or her. The leader will use a social skill, either [[Consoler]] or [[Pacifier]], to calm the unhappy dwarf. The results of this depend on the leader's skill level. 

<!-- Unconfirmed - I tested, and they seem to do their work

This process is buggy -- if the leader is interrupted during the meeting, the civilian will sometimes get stuck in the "Conduct Meeting" labor. Drafting and undrafting the civilian might help snap them out of it.
