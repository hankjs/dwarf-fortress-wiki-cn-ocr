'''Horses''' are common [[domestic animal|domestic pack animals]] who can often be seen in [[caravan]]s pulling [[wagon]]s and carrying goods. In addition to producing a large amount of [[meat]], [[fat]] and [[bone]]s when [[butcher]]ed, horses can also be [[milker|milked]] and serve as a viable base for a [[cheese]] industry. [[dwarf|Dwarves]] cannot ride horses, but [[human]]s and [[elf|elves]] can. Horses require a sizable [[pasture]] to survive.

Horses can be bought before embarking, but are quite expensive. Horses are sometimes brought along by [[Immigration|immigrants]], as [[pet]]s or strays. Horses also occur very often as wild animals in herds. They are non-aggressive and will avoid dwarves, but an inexperienced [[hunter]] who engages them in melee will soon find out that they are much bigger than dwarves, and over twice as fast. As they appear quite frequently and in numbers, they are ideal targets for hunting and military practice, being also a good source of butchering products.

Some dwarves [[Preferences|like]] horses for their ''strength''.

{{D for Dwarf}}
Horses are '''everywhere'''. That "dwarven" fortress over the distance? It's one dwarf and about 500 horses. The whole world is horses. I'm horses. Hell, you're probably horses too. Neigh.
