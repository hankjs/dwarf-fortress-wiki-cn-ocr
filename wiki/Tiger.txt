'''Tigers''' are strong carnivorous [[Creature|animals]] that roam [[tropical]] areas. They are one of the [[List of creatures by adult size|largest]] "normal" carnivores. Tigers may also appear as [[mount]]s during a [[siege]].

Captured wild tigers may be [[animal trainer|trained]] and kept as [[pet]]s, turned into hunting or war beasts, or bred as livestock for a [[meat industry]]. While they do not produce as much meat as some common livestock, tiger [[butcher]]ing returns are worth three times as much as those of common domestic animals. Due to their limited population size, capturing a breeding pair may prove difficult. Sometimes [[elf|elven]] [[caravan]]s have fully tame tigers to trade. 

Tigers make decent war animals, and they breed relatively rapidly. As [[grazer|non-grazers]], tigers don't require a [[pasture]], and so need no special attention after taming.

Some dwarves [[Preferences|like]] tigers for their ''stripes, of course''.
