'''Rider''' is a [[skill]] used by intelligent creatures to travel on [[mount]]s. A higher skill level allows the rider greater control over a mount, though this is only applicable when the mount attempts to act on its own, such as when it becomes [[status effect|terrified or enraged]]. While invaders can arrive on mounts, [[fortress mode|fortress]] members cannot use mounts (yet); [[adventure]]rs can, both with mounts they start with from character creation, and with [[stray]] [[tame]] mountable creatures they might encounter (those with {{token|MOUNT|creature}}).
