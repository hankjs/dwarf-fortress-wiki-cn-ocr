{{D for Dwarf}}

== a.k.a. Science On Fire ==
A specific form of [[wikipedia:Bartle Test#Explorers|spading]] in which one or more dwarven test subjects are observed in laboratory habitat. Dwarves may also conduct such test; indeed the same dwarf performing ‼Science‼ may also ''be'' the ‼Science‼ Dwarven adventurers may also perform ‼Science‼, but if it's not a dwarf, it just isn't ‼Science‼

Not to be confused with science. ‼Science‼, in comparison to science, generally involves more magma, more [[‼]][[Dwarf|DWARVES]][[‼]] and more [[Fun]].
