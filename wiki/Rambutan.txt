'''Rambutan''' is one of the many genera of [[tree]]s found above ground. Like the vast majority of above ground trees, rambutan [[wood]] is brown and produces brown products.

Rambutan trees bear [[wikipedia:Rambutan#Fruit|fruit]] that can be harvested by setting up a gathering [[zone]]. They can be eaten raw, cooked, or brewed into [[alcohol|rambutan wine]].  Rambutan seeds can be cooked in a [[kitchen]], a rarity for tree fruit seeds.

Some [[Dwarf|dwarves]] [[Preferences|like]] rambutan trees for their ''fruit''.
