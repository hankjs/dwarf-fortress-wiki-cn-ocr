'''Bark scorpion men''' are humanoid versions of the common [[bark scorpion]], and a [[Creature|species]] of [[animal people]], found in [[savage]] [[desert]]s and [[tropical]] areas. They are a bit over half the size of [[dwarf|dwarves]] and spawn in groups of 1-3 individuals. With a total of 6 arms (each with a hand) and 2 pincers, they can equip multiple items at once and also retain the poisonous sting of their animal counterparts, which causes pain in the victim when injected. The creatures themselves are additionally [[No Pain|immune to pain]], [[No Stun|stunning]], fear and paralysis, never need to sleep and possess extravision. All bark scorpion men are born with Legendary [[skill]] in [[Climber|climbing]]. 

Like other savage animal people, bark scorpion men may occasionally join [[civilization]]s, becoming full-fledged citizens who may appear in your fortress as [[visitor]]s or be playable in [[adventurer mode]]. If playing as a bark scorpion man, your stinger can be used to sting foes, which forces them into a prone state and applies a good amount of pain that will stun most enemies. The sting can force even undead into a prone state, but it will not stun them or even cost them a turn. Also, note that they cannot jump.

Some dwarves [[Preferences|like]] bark scorpion men for their ''pincers'' and their ''stinging tail''.

Bark Scorpion Men are known to use their stinging tails as harpoons or hooks of a sort, and some have been observed to cry "Get over here!" when pulling in their prey. Some dubious tales report pyrokinetic powers and teleportation being among a Scorpion Man's abilities, but the lack of these attributes in any other creatures leaves scholars in denial.
