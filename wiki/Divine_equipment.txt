[[File:divine_equipment_preview2.png|right]]'''Divine equipment''' is a catch-all term for special, procedurally-generated [[weapon]]s, [[armor]], and [[clothing]] that can be found in [[vault]]s as well as deep underground. Divine equipment is used by [[angel]]s, who ruthlessly protect the vault's priceless treasures. Divine equipment is usually made from [[divine metal]]s and [[divine fabric]]s.

In fortress mode, divine equipment can be found on the lowest z levels, a few levels above the magma sea. A message "You have discovered an [[unusual volcanic wall]] studded with gems" will appear, pinpointing its location once the magma sea has been discovered. These gem clusters contain two kinds of divine equipment, "Treasure of the gods", which are [[artifact]]s created with divine materials, and the divine equipment of angels that reside in these gem clusters. Their main difference is that angel equipment can be melted and repurposed for specific items, such as a [[monarch]]'s throne.

Graphically, sprites of weapons made with divine materials will appear as having a silver and cyan design.

== Traits ==
Each [[vault]] entity generates a set of equipment: weapons, shields, clothing and armor. Each item is based on a default item; adding an adjective ("bulging", "bulky", "segmented", etc.) and potentially a new name ("[[Short sword|blade]]", "[[Large dagger|nail]]"). Dwarves in [[strange mood]]s may produce one of these procedurally-generated items as they would any other foreign item of that [[Item token|type]]. Divine equipment subtypes are generally equivalent in stats to standard items, with their advantages coming from either [[artifact]] [[Item quality|quality]] or [[Divine fabric|exceptional]] [[Divine metal|materials]].

Because divine equipment is procedurally generated, it does not have a consistent ID and cannot normally be assigned [[graphics]].{{bug|13074}}
