'''Weapon racks''' ({{menu icon|b|y|r}}) are a type of [[furniture]] which can be used to decorate a [[barracks]], satisfy a [[noble]]'s housing requirements, or raise the [[value]] of a [[zone|room]].

When used in a barracks designated for individual equipment storage, dwarves will prefer to store their weapons on the racks instead of [[stockpile]]s. Doing so in concert with [[armor stand]]s allows you to create centralized armories for your military.
