'''Sapphire''' is a valuable blue [[gem]] found in small clusters within [[bauxite]] clusters. A given cluster may also contain a single [[star sapphire]], a gem 1.5&times; as valuable. It is not magma-safe, having the same melting point ({{ct|11500}}) and other properties as its more valuable relative.

Like all precious and rare gems, they may also make up part of the walls of [[unusual volcanic wall]]s.

==In real life==
"Sapphire" is any type of corundum (Aluminum Oxide: Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>) which is not red (which would be classified as a [[ruby]]); Unlike in-game, sapphires do '''not''' occur within [[bauxite]] in real life. Although sapphires in real life can be a variety of colours, in ''Dwarf Fortress'', they are always blue.
