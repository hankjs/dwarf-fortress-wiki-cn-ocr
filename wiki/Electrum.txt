'''Electrum''' is an [[alloy]] of equal parts [[gold]] and [[silver]]. Electrum [[bar]]s can be made at a [[smelter]] by a dwarf with the [[furnace operating]] labor activated. Electrum is useful for high-value [[crafts]], [[furniture]], and [[decoration]]s.

One [[gold]] bar and one [[silver]] bar will produce two electrum bars. One gold nugget and one silver-bearing [[ore]] will produce eight electrum bars.

Smelting bars together consumes a value 30 material and a value 10 material to produce two units of value 20, thus producing no net gain (or loss); you're taking a high-value item and a medium-value item and averaging their values. The value relative to density is improved greatly, however, and makes hauling jobs much more efficient. Smelting the ores directly saves you five units of [[fuel]] (if you don't have access to [[magma]]). Moreover, low-value [[galena]] or [[tetrahedrite]] can be substituted for [[native silver]] or [[horn silver]], producing more value overall than would be generated from smelting the ores separately. Thus, if you have access to galena or tetrahedrite, producing electrum bars creates value.
