'''Nether-caps''' are a type of mushroom-like subterranean [[tree]]. Once fully grown, they can be designated for [[wood cutting]] and produce nether-cap [[log]]s. They often grow on muddied rock in the 3rd [[Caverns|underground cavern]] layer and, once discovered, will begin to grow in any suitable environment within your fortress as well.

Nether-caps and their products are dark indigo, and they have the unique property of being naturally cold, having a fixed [[temperature]] of {{ct|10000}} (the [[Water#Freezing point|freezing point of water]]). Most objects made from this wood are not massive enough to change the ambient temperature around them to this point, however, so nether-cap cannot cause [[water]] to turn into [[ice]]. This fixed temperature gives nether-cap wood a strange quasi-[[magma-safe]] quality. You can use nether-cap as a substitution for metal [[magma-safe]] components (for example, in a [[magma]] [[pump stack]]), but a nether-cap minecart will not resist magma, and nether-cap items [[dump]]ed into magma will be destroyed. However, a magma-safe metal minecart filled with lava can be safely carried in a nether-cap wheelbarrow. Interestingly, nether-cap logs can still be burned into ash or charcoal at a [[wood furnace]], and nether-cap items laying on the ground can be ignited by fire-breathing/throwing creatures. 

Some [[dwarves]] [[Preferences|like]] nether-caps for their ''coldness to the touch''.
