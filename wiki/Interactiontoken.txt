! Token
! Context
! Arguments
! Description
|-| {{text anchor|INTERACTION}}| Global| ID| Used to start defining a new interaction. The term "interaction ID" refers to the text specified within this token; this is used to make reference to the interaction in various other places.
|-| {{text anchor|EXPERIMENT_ONLY}}| Global| | Disallows use of the interaction in play, but if the interaction animates or resurrects corpses, or has an I_SOURCE:EXPERIMENT tag, it can be used in worldgen. Animation and resurrection interactions do not need I_SOURCE:EXPERIMENT to work in worldgen.
|-| {{text anchor|I_SOURCE}}| Global| type| Defines what things are capable of triggering this interaction - multiple sources may be specified. Valid values:
* '''CREATURE_ACTION''' - Specifies that the interaction may be used in conjunction with [[Creature_token#CAN_DO_INTERACTION|[CAN_DO_INTERACTION]]] and [[Syndrome#CE_CAN_DO_INTERACTION|[CE_CAN_DO_INTERACTION]]], but it isn't actually necessary for this. It might exist simply to allow for the inclusion of IS_ tokens (detailed below) to be applied when the interaction is used in this context.
* '''ATTACK''' - Allows the interaction to be used in conjunction with [[Creature_token#SPECIALATTACK_INTERACTION|[SPECIALATTACK_INTERACTION]]] and [[Syndrome#CE_SPECIAL_ATTACK_INTERACTION|[CE_SPECIAL_ATTACK_INTERACTION]]].
* '''INGESTION''' - Allows the interaction to be used in conjunction with [[Syndrome#CE_BODY_MAT_INTERACTION|[CE_BODY_MAT_INTERACTION]]].
* '''DEITY''' - Allows the interaction to be inflicted upon mortals by the gods, for reasons dictated by [[Interaction_token#IS_USAGE_HINT|[IS_USAGE_HINT]]].
* '''SECRET''' - Allows the interaction to act as a secret which can be learnt and passed on to others, as specified via [[Interaction_token#IS_SECRET|[IS_SECRET]]]. Appropriate [[Interaction_token#I_EFFECT|interaction effects]] with a [[Interaction_token#IE_TARGET|creature target]] will be applied to individuals who learn the secret. It is possible to set restrictions on who may learn the secret by using creature target tokens as described below. Also see [[Interaction_token#IS_SECRET_GOAL|[IS_SECRET_GOAL]]] and [[Interaction_token#IS_SPHERE|[IS_SPHERE]]].
* '''REGION''' - Allows the interaction to take place spontaneously in regions specified using [[Interaction_token#IS_REGION|[IS_REGION]]]. Also see [[Interaction_token#IS_FREQUENCY|[IS_FREQUENCY]]] and [[Interaction_token#IE_INTERMITTENT|[IE_INTERMITTENT]]].
* '''DISTURBANCE''' - Allows the interaction to take place spontaneously in disturbed [[tomb|tombs]]; generated interactions with this token are used to create [[mummy|mummies]].
* '''UNDERGROUND_SPECIAL''' - Allows the interaction to take place spontaneously in [[Demonic fortress|curious underground structures]] (which no longer generate); generated interactions with this token used to be used to produce [[undead|zombies]] when creating the structure's inhabitants.
* '''EXPERIMENT''' - This can be used by NIGHT_CREATURE_EXPERIMENTERs while "performing horrible experiments" in worldgen. Only seems relevant for interactions that target living creatures. Note that all NIGHT_CREATURE_EXPERIMENTERs have access to generated experiments, and due to the large number of generated experiments available custom experiment interactions will tend to show up very rarely.
* '''MYTHICAL''' - Presumably used to upgrade creatures guarding a [[mysterious dungeon]].
* '''ITEM_POWER''' - Granted by a ◄[[magic]] item►. Currently can only be found on [[Primordial remnant#Equipment|remnant weapons]], which chooses a random interaction with this source.
|-| {{text anchor|IS_HIST_STRING_1}}| Within I_SOURCE| text| Describes what the interaction did to a historical figure; this is displayed in legends mode following the name of the historical figure who performed the interaction and preceding the name of the targeted historical figure (or, in the case of [[Interaction_token#I_SOURCE|[I_SOURCE:INGESTION]]], the historical figure from whom the consumed material was extracted).

[IS_HIST_STRING_1: cursed]
|-| {{text anchor|IS_HIST_STRING_2}}| Within I_SOURCE| text| Describes what the interaction did to a historical figure; this is displayed in legends mode after the name of the historical figure who was targeted by the interaction. In the case of [[Interaction_token#I_SOURCE|[I_SOURCE:INGESTION]]], it is displayed after the name of the historical figure from whom the consumed material was extracted.

[IS_HIST_STRING_2: to assume the form of a lizard-like monster every full moon]
|-| {{text anchor|IS_TRIGGER_STRING}}| Within I_SOURCE| text| Displayed as an announcement when the interaction is carried out during play. The text follows the name of the target unit, and is preceded by [[Interaction_token#IS_TRIGGER_STRING_SECOND|IS_TRIGGER_STRING_SECOND]] or [[Interaction_token#IS_TRIGGER_STRING_THIRD|IS_TRIGGER_STRING_THIRD]]. May be limited to [[Interaction_token#I_SOURCE|[I_SOURCE:DEITY]]] and [[Interaction_token#I_SOURCE|[I_SOURCE:EXPERIMENT]]] interactions at present; this still needs to be tested.

[IS_TRIGGER_STRING: been infected with a contagious ghoulish condition]
|-| {{text anchor|IS_TRIGGER_STRING_SECOND}}| Within I_SOURCE| text| Presented before the [[Interaction_token#IS_TRIGGER_STRING|IS_TRIGGER_STRING]] when describing the event in the second person.

[IS_TRIGGER_STRING_SECOND: have]
|-| {{text anchor|IS_TRIGGER_STRING_THIRD}}| Within I_SOURCE| text| Presented before the [[Interaction_token#IS_TRIGGER_STRING|IS_TRIGGER_STRING]] when describing the event in the third person.

[IS_TRIGGER_STRING_THIRD: has]
|-| {{text anchor|IS_NAME}}| Within I_SOURCE| string| Generally used with [[Interaction_token#I_SOURCE|[I_SOURCE:SECRET]]] interactions to describe what the secret is about (though it may be used to name any I_SOURCE). This name is engraved onto the appropriate secret-containing slabs from worldgen, and is used in legends mode when describing the secret being learnt by historical figures.

[IS_NAME:the secrets of life and death]
|-| {{text anchor|IS_SPHERE}}| Within I_SOURCE:SECRET| [[Sphere#Available_spheres|sphere]]| Indicates the [[sphere]] to which this secret pertains. Only one sphere can be defined for each [I_SOURCE:SECRET] token, so several [I_SOURCE:SECRET] tokens are required to make a secret belong to multiple spheres.
|-| {{text anchor|IS_SECRET_GOAL}}| Within I_SOURCE:SECRET| Secret Goal token| Indicates why somebody would want to learn the secret. Valid values:
* '''STAY_ALIVE'''
* '''MAINTAIN_ENTITY_STATUS'''
* '''START_A_FAMILY'''
* '''RULE_THE_WORLD'''
* '''CREATE_A_GREAT_WORK_OF_ART'''
* '''CRAFT_A_MASTERWORK'''
* '''BRING_PEACE_TO_THE_WORLD'''
* '''BECOME_A_LEGENDARY_WARRIOR'''
* '''MASTER_A_SKILL'''
* '''FALL_IN_LOVE'''
* '''SEE_THE_GREAT_NATURAL_SITES'''
* '''IMMORTALITY'''
* '''MAKE_A_GREAT_DISCOVERY'''
* '''ATTAIN_RANK_IN_SOCIETY'''
* '''BATHE_WORLD_IN_CHAOS'''
However, currently only IMMORTALITY will result in a secret being pursued during worldgen.
|-| {{text anchor|IS_SECRET}}| Within I_SOURCE:SECRET| Secret Flag| Indicates how the secret can be learned. Valid values:
* '''SUPERNATURAL_LEARNING_POSSIBLE''' - gods may gift the secret to their worshippers. Secrets with [[Interaction_token#IS_SPHERE|[IS_SPHERE]]] specified may only be granted by gods who have at least one matching sphere.
* '''MUNDANE_RESEARCH_POSSIBLE''' - the secret can be researched by mundane means. This doesn't do anything at present. [http://www.bay12forums.com/smf/index.php?topic=169696.msg8243222#msg8243222].
* '''MUNDANE_TEACHING_POSSIBLE''' - the secret can be taught to apprentices
* '''MUNDANE_RECORDING_POSSIBLE:TITLE_SET:NAME_SET''' - the secret can be written in books whose title and name are taken from the specified text sets. If this tag is present, a slab will be created upon learning the secret by supernatural means.
|-| {{text anchor|IS_USAGE_HINT}}| Within I_SOURCE:DEITY| Usage Hint token| Indicates why a deity would choose to perform this interaction. See [[Interaction_token#USAGE_HINT|CDI:USAGE_HINT]] below for valid values - in this context, '''MINOR_BLESSING''', '''MEDIUM_BLESSING''', '''MINOR_CURSE''', '''MEDIUM_CURSE''', and '''MAJOR_CURSE''' are the only values that make sense.
|-| {{text anchor|IS_REGION}}| Within I_SOURCE:REGION| Region type| Indicates what types of regions are capable of performing this interaction. This token may be specified several times per I_SOURCE to permit multiple terrain/alignment types. Valid values:

* '''ANY''' permits the interaction to occur in all regions, regardless of terrain or alignment

[[Biome|Terrain]]:

* '''DESERT'''
* '''FOREST'''
* '''GLACIER'''
* '''GRASSLAND'''
* '''HILLS'''
* '''LAKE'''
* '''MOUNTAINS'''
* '''OCEAN'''
* '''SWAMP'''
* '''TUNDRA'''
* '''ANY_TERRAIN''' permits the interaction to occur in all regions which meet alignment specifications

[[Surroundings#Combinations & characteristics of surroundings|Alignment]]:

* '''NORMAL_ALLOWED'''
* '''EVIL_ALLOWED'''
* '''GOOD_ALLOWED'''
* '''SAVAGE_ALLOWED'''
* '''EVIL_ONLY'''
* '''GOOD_ONLY'''
* '''SAVAGE_ONLY'''
|-| {{text anchor|IS_FREQUENCY}}| Within I_SOURCE| Probability| When used with [[Interaction_token#I_SOURCE|[I_SOURCE:REGION]]], determines how likely it is for the region(s) specified via [[Interaction_token#IS_REGION|[IS_REGION]]] to possess this interaction.

Note: it appears that regions aren't allowed to possess more than a single regional interaction at present.
|-| {{text anchor|IS_POWER_LEVEL}}| Within I_SOURCE:MYTHICAL| 1-3| Corresponds to the three tiers of [[mysterious dungeon]].
|-| {{text anchor|IS_DESCRIPTION}}| Within I_SOURCE:ITEM_POWER| string| Adds the given string to the affected item's description.
|-| {{text anchor|IS_CDI}}| Within I_SOURCE:ITEM_POWER| [[Interaction_token#Usage|CDI token]]| Details the interaction that the item grants. Comparable to {{token|CAN_DO_INTERACTION}}.
|-| {{text anchor|I_TARGET}}| Global| ID, type| Defines the targets available for subsequent use with [[Interaction_token#I_EFFECT|[I_EFFECT]]] tokens. Multiple targets may be specified; the precise target(s) used with each interaction effect are indicated via their ID (see [[Interaction_token#IE_TARGET|[IE_TARGET]]]). Valid values:
* '''CORPSE''' - The target is a [[Item_token#CORPSE|CORPSE]] or [[Item_token#CORPSEPIECE|CORPSEPIECE]] item.
* '''CREATURE''' - The target is a [[Creature|unit]].
* '''MATERIAL''' - This is a valid target for use in [[Interaction_token#I_EFFECT|[I_EFFECT:MATERIAL_EMISSION]]] interaction effects, and is used to set the material or flow type of the emission. This information, in turn, is either obtained from an [[Interaction_token#IT_MATERIAL|[IT_MATERIAL]]] token or by using [[Interaction_token#IT_LOCATION|[IT_LOCATION:CONTEXT_MATERIAL]]]. Using the latter implies that the precise emission info will be provided when defining [[Interaction_token#Breath_attacks|how an interaction user can use the interaction in question via CDI tokens]], enabling one to create 'template' material emission interactions such as the MATERIAL_EMISSION and MATERIAL_EMISSION_WITH_HIDE interactions included in the vanilla raws.
* '''LOCATION''' - The target is a [[tile|local map tile]]. If used with [[Interaction_token#IT_LOCATION|[IT_LOCATION:CONTEXT_CREATURE_OR_LOCATION]]], creatures at the target tile are also valid targets.
|-| {{text anchor|IT_LOCATION}}| Within I_TARGET| Location| This is often included after [[Interaction_token#I_TARGET|[I_TARGET]]] token to add more detail about the target. Valid values:
* '''CONTEXT_CREATURE''' - Used with CREATURE to target the whole unit.
* '''CONTEXT_BP''' - Used with CREATURE to target the body part specified in [[Interaction_token#BP_REQUIRED|[CDI:BP_REQUIRED]]].
* '''CONTEXT_LOCATION''' - Used with LOCATION to target only a tile.
* '''CONTEXT_CREATURE_OR_LOCATION''' - Used with LOCATION to allow for targetting of both creatures and tiles.
* '''CONTEXT_ITEM''' - Used with CORPSE.
* '''CONTEXT_REGION''' - Can only be used by [[Interaction_token#I_SOURCE|[I_SOURCE:REGION]]] interactions.
* '''CONTEXT_MATERIAL''' - Used with MATERIAL if you want an [[Interaction_token#I_EFFECT|[I_EFFECT:MATERIAL_EMISSION]]] to obtain the emission material/flow type from [[Interaction_token#MATERIAL|[CDI:MATERIAL]]] or [[Interaction_token#FLOW|[CDI:FLOW]]].
* '''RANDOM_NEARBY_LOCATION''' - Used with LOCATION. Targets a location from somewhere random within a number of squares from another LOCATION target specified by its target ID. For example, [I_TARGET:B:LOCATION] with [IT_LOCATION:RANDOM_NEARBY_LOCATION:A:5] will randomly select a tile lying somewhere within a radius of 5 tiles from [I_TARGET:A:LOCATION]. A walkable path between the two locations must exist.
|-| {{text anchor|IT_MANUAL_INPUT}}| Within I_TARGET| text| Tells the adventure mode player what they should be selecting. If not specified, the player will only be able to target themselves.
|-| {{text anchor|IT_AFFECTED_CREATURE}}| Within I_TARGET:CORPSE or I_TARGET:CREATURE| CREATURE:CASTE| Specifies specific creatures the interaction can target.
|-| {{text anchor|IT_AFFECTED_CLASS}}| Within I_TARGET:CORPSE or I_TARGET:CREATURE| Creature class| Specifies creature classes the interaction can target.
|-| {{text anchor|IT_IMMUNE_CREATURE}}| Within I_TARGET:CORPSE or I_TARGET:CREATURE| CREATURE:CASTE| Specifies specific creatures the interaction cannot target.
|-| {{text anchor|IT_IMMUNE_CLASS}}| Within I_TARGET:CORPSE or I_TARGET:CREATURE| Creature class| Specifies creature classes the interaction cannot target.
|-| {{text anchor|IT_REQUIRES}}| Within I_TARGET:CORPSE or I_TARGET:CREATURE| Creature token or property| Indicates that the target must have the specified property. Valid values:
* '''FIT_FOR_ANIMATION''' - Any corpse or body part that can become a zombie (heads, hands, etc.)
* '''FIT_FOR_RESURRECTION''' - The target corpse's UPPERBODY must be attached.
* '''HAS_BLOOD'''
* '''MORTAL'''
* '''NO_AGING'''
* '''STERILE'''
* Creature token: '''BLOODSUCKER, CAN_LEARN, CAN_SPEAK, CRAZED, EXTRAVISION, MISCHIEVOUS''' (or '''MISCHIEVIOUS'''), '''NO_CONNECTIONS_FOR_MOVEMENT, NO_DIZZINESS, NO_DRINK, NO_EAT, NO_FEVERS, NO_PHYS_ATT_GAIN, NO_PHYS_ATT_RUST, NO_SLEEP, NO_THOUGHT_CENTER_FOR_MOVEMENT, NOBREATHE, NOEMOTION, NOEXERT, NOFEAR, NONAUSEA, NOPAIN, NOSTUN, NOT_LIVING, NOTHOUGHT, OPPOSED_TO_LIFE, PARALYZEIMMUNE, SUPERNATURAL, TRANCES, UTTERANCES'''
|-| {{text anchor|IT_FORBIDDEN}}| Within I_TARGET:CORPSE or I_TARGET:CREATURE| Creature token or property| Indicates that the target must not have the specified property. Valid values are the same as for IT_REQUIRES.
|-| {{text anchor|IT_CANNOT_TARGET_IF_ALREADY_AFFECTED}}| Within I_TARGET:CORPSE or I_TARGET:CREATURE| | Prevents the interaction from targeting a creature that's already under the effect of the same interaction.
|-| {{text anchor|IT_CANNOT_HAVE_SYNDROME_CLASS}}| Within I_TARGET:CORPSE or I_TARGET:CREATURE| [[Syndrome]] class| Prevents the interaction from targeting a creature under the effects of a syndrome having the specified SYN_CLASS value.
|-| {{text anchor|IT_MATERIAL}}| Within I_TARGET:MATERIAL| type| Specifies the type of material the interaction targets; currently only used for [[Interaction_token#I_EFFECT|MATERIAL_EMISSION]] interaction effects. See [[Interaction_token#Breath_Attacks_Types|Breath Attack Types]]. Valid values:
* '''FLOW''':Breath attack token - The emission will consist of the specified special flow type.
* '''MATERIAL''':[[Material token]]:Breath attack token - The emission will consist of the specified material dispersed in the specified manner.
* '''CONTEXT_MATERIAL''' - Indicates the emission details should be obtained from [[Interaction_token#MATERIAL|[CDI:MATERIAL]]] or [[Interaction_token#FLOW|[CDI:FLOW]]].
|-| {{text anchor|I_EFFECT}}| Global| type| Specifies what the interaction does to the targets. Multiple [I_EFFECT]s may be specified in a single interaction, and the same type may be used more than once. Valid values:

* '''ADD_SYNDROME''' - Adds one or more syndromes to a valid creature target.  You must specify the syndrome details just below this interaction effect using the <code>[[Syndrome#SYNDROME|[SYNDROME]]]</code> tag followed by the relevant syndrome tokens. See [[syndrome#The anatomy of a syndrome|here]] for more information.

* '''ANIMATE''' - Raises the target corpse/bodypart as an [[undead]] unit. The zombie will always be hostile to life and will retain no information about its original personality/loyalties. Syndromes can also be specified within this tag. If a regional interaction contains this effect, affected regions will have undead wildlife.

* '''RESURRECT''' - Takes a target corpse and returns the creature to life.  This can be used on parts that are not FIT_FOR_RESURRECTION, but only the main part (with an UPPERBODY attached) will remain loyal to its original faction.  Syndromes can also be specified within this tag.

* '''CLEAN''' - Removes [[Contaminant|contaminants]] from a valid creature target. See {{token|IE_GRIME_LEVEL|in}}  and {{token|IE_SYNDROME_TAG|in}}.

* '''CONTACT''' - Causes the creatures to touch.

* '''MATERIAL_EMISSION''' - Causes a particular material to be emitted. Used by [[evil weather]] and the MATERIAL_EMISSION interaction.

* '''HIDE''' - Allows the creature to [[Ambusher|hide]] even if another creature can see it.

* '''CREATE_ITEM''' - Creates an item as described by {{token|IE_ITEM|in}} and {{token|IE_ITEM_QUALITY|in}}.

* '''CHANGE_ITEM_QUALITY''' - Alters an item's quality level as indicated by either {{token|IE_CHANGE_QUALITY|in}} or {{token|IE_SET_QUALITY|in}}. When targeting a unit, all items equipped by that unit will be affected.

* '''SUMMON_UNIT''' - Creates a new unit at the target. The type of unit can either be specified using the {{token|CREATURE|in}} token, or made to be randomly selected as indicated by a variety of flag-based tokens: {{token|IE_CREATURE_FLAG|in}}, {{token|IE_FORBIDDEN_CREATURE_FLAG|in}}, {{token|IE_CREATURE_CASTE_FLAG|in}}, {{token|IE_FORBIDDEN_CREATURE_CASTE_FLAG|in}}, {{token|IE_HAVE_FAST_EFFORTLESS_GAIT_SPEED|in}} and/or {{token|IE_ALL_SLOW_EFFORTLESS_GAIT_SPEED|in}}. See also {{token|IE_TIME_RANGE|in}} and {{token|IE_MAKE_PET_IF_POSSIBLE|in}}.

* '''PROPEL_UNIT''' - Applies a force specified using {{token|IE_PROPEL_FORCE|in}} to a unit to knock it back.

* '''CHANGE_WEATHER''' - Changes the weather as specified by {{token|IE_ADD_WEATHER|in}} and/or {{token|IE_REMOVE_WEATHER|in}}.

* '''RAISE_GHOST''' - Present in version 0.47.01 and accepted as a valid I_EFFECT token, but does not have an effect currently.
|-| {{text anchor|IE_ARENA_NAME}}| Within I_EFFECT| text| Allows the interaction effect to be applied directly to newly spawned creatures in [[object testing arena|arena mode]]. The specified name is used to represent it within the creature creation [[Object_testing_arena#Effects|effects list]].
|-| {{text anchor|IE_TARGET}}| Within I_EFFECT| ID| Specifies which [[Interaction_token#I_TARGET|I_TARGET]] a particular interaction effect will be applied to. For example, in an interaction with the token [I_TARGET:B:CREATURE], 'B' is the ID used to indicate this target option. [I_EFFECT:ADD_SYNDROME] followed by [IE_TARGET:B] would therefore apply the syndrome to this target. Certain types of interaction effects require multiple IE_TARGET tokens in a specific order to function properly. A few effects do not require a target at all.
|-| {{text anchor|IE_INTERMITTENT}}| Within I_EFFECT| Frequency| Only appears to work with [I_SOURCE:REGION] interactions. Indicates that the effect happens intermittently and specifies roughly how often. Regional interactions aren't able to use effects which lack this token. Valid values:
* '''WEEKLY'''

Note: DAILY, MONTHLY and YEARLY also exist in the string dump but don't appear to work at present.
|-| {{text anchor|IE_IMMEDIATE}}| Within I_EFFECT|| Indicates that the effect happens immediately.
|-| {{text anchor|IE_LOCATION}}| Within I_EFFECT| Location Hint| Prevents the interaction effect from manifesting unless the target is in a location which meets the specified criteria. 
Valid values:
* '''IN_WATER'''
* '''IN_MAGMA'''
* '''NO_WATER'''
* '''NO_MAGMA'''
* '''NO_THICK_FOG'''
* '''OUTSIDE'''
A [[Water#Depth|depth]] of 1/7 is sufficient for IN_WATER and IN_MAGMA.

Note: NO_THICK_FOG and OUTSIDE are accepted as valid location hints when specified with IE_LOCATION, but don't appear to work. It's possible that they're currently only implemented for use with <code>[[Interaction_token#LOCATION_HINT|[CDI:LOCATION_HINT]]]</code>.
|-| {{text anchor|IE_ADD_WEATHER}}| Within I_EFFECT:CHANGE_WEATHER| type| Indicates what type of weather is added. Valid values:
* '''FOG_MIST'''
* '''FOG_NORMAL'''
* '''FOG_THICK'''
* '''FRONT_WARM'''
* '''FRONT_COLD'''
* '''FRONT_OCCLUDED'''
* '''STRATUS_ALTO'''
* '''STRATUS_PROPER'''
* '''STRATUS_NIMBUS'''
* '''CUMULUS_MED'''
* '''CUMULUS_MULTI'''
* '''CUMULUS_NIMBUS'''
* '''CIRRUS'''
|-| {{text anchor|IE_REMOVE_WEATHER}}| Within I_EFFECT:CHANGE_WEATHER| type| Indicates what type of weather is removed. See [[Interaction_token#IE_ADD_WEATHER|above]] for a list of valid weather types.
|-| {{text anchor|IE_GRIME_LEVEL}}| Within I_EFFECT:CLEAN| amount?| [IE_GRIME_LEVEL:2] appears in the default cleaning interaction, and may indicate amount of grime cleaned.
|-| {{text anchor|IE_SYNDROME_TAG}}| Within I_EFFECT:CLEAN| syndrome trigger flag| When a creature cleans off a [[contaminant]] which is associated with a [[syndrome]], the syndrome will be contracted if it has a matching [[Syndrome#The_anatomy_of_a_syndrome|trigger flag]]. This is what enables [[cat]]s to become slightly inebriated when licking off [[alcohol]]. '''SYN_INGESTED''' appears to be the only syndrome trigger flag that works in this context.
|-| {{text anchor|IE_PROPEL_FORCE}}| Within I_EFFECT:PROPEL_UNIT| amount| Indicates the amount of force that the target will be propelled with.
|-| {{text anchor|IE_ITEM}}| Within I_EFFECT:CREATE_ITEM| <probability>:<quantity>:[[item token]]:[[material token]]| Defines what item will be created.
|-| {{text anchor|IE_ITEM_QUALITY}}| Within I_EFFECT:CREATE_ITEM| <[[Item_quality|quality]]> OR <minimum [[Item_quality|quality]]>:<maximum [[Item_quality|quality]]>| Defines what [[Item quality|quality]] the created item shall have. Can either be specified in the form of a single, fixed quality (it seems that ARTIFACT can only be used in this manner), or a minimum and maximum level (in which case the quality is selected randomly). Valid values (numerals only except for ARTIFACT):
* '''0''' = ordinary
* '''1''' = well-crafted
* '''2''' = finely crafted
* '''3''' = superior quality
* '''4''' = exceptional
* '''5''' = masterwork
* '''ARTIFACT'''
|-| {{text anchor|IE_SET_QUALITY}}| Within I_EFFECT:CHANGE_ITEM_QUALITY| [[Interaction_token#IE_ITEM_QUALITY|quality level]]| Defines a fixed [[Item_quality|quality]] level which the affected item(s) will be set to (decreasing or increasing in quality as necessary). See [[Interaction_token#IE_ITEM_QUALITY|above]] for a list of valid quality levels (but note that ARTIFACT cannot be used in this effect).
|-| {{text anchor|IE_CHANGE_QUALITY}}| Within I_EFFECT:CHANGE_ITEM_QUALITY| amount| Determines how much the [[Item_quality|quality]] of the item(s) will be changed. For instance, improving a well-crafted -item- ([[Interaction_token#IE_ITEM_QUALITY|quality level]] 1) by 2 will turn it into a superior-quality *item* (quality level 3). A negative value can be used to decrease quality. Quality cannot be increased beyond level 5 (masterwork) or decreased below level 0 (ordinary).
|-| {{text anchor|CREATURE}}| Within I_EFFECT:SUMMON_UNIT| <creature token>:<caste token>| Indicates which specific creature will be created when using this interaction. ANY can be used in place of a specific caste token. Only one [CREATURE] may currently be specified per interaction effect.
|-| {{text anchor|IE_CREATURE_FLAG}}| Within I_EFFECT:SUMMON_UNIT| <[[Interaction_token#Creature_and_Caste_Flags|creature flag]]>| When this token is added to a random creature summoning effect, it narrows down the selection to creatures which have the specified [[Interaction_token#Creature_and_Caste_Flags|creature flag]]. This token may be used multiple times per interaction effect; creatures which lack any of the indicated flags will never be summoned.
|-| {{text anchor|IE_FORBIDDEN_CREATURE_FLAG}}| Within I_EFFECT:SUMMON_UNIT| <[[Interaction_token#Creature_and_Caste_Flags|creature flag]]>| When this token is added to a random creature summoning effect, any creature with the specified [[Interaction_token#Creature_and_Caste_Flags|creature flag]] will be excluded from the selection. This token may be used multiple times per interaction effect; creatures which possess any of the indicated flags will never be summoned.
|-| {{text anchor|IE_CREATURE_CASTE_FLAG}}| Within I_EFFECT:SUMMON_UNIT| <[[Interaction_token#Creature_and_Caste_Flags|caste flag]]>| When this token is added to a random creature summoning effect, it narrows down the selection to creatures which have the specified [[Interaction_token#Creature_and_Caste_Flags|caste flag]]. This token may be used multiple times per interaction effect; creatures which lack any of the indicated flags will never be summoned.
|-| {{text anchor|IE_FORBIDDEN_CREATURE_CASTE_FLAG}}| Within I_EFFECT:SUMMON_UNIT| <[[Interaction_token#Creature_and_Caste_Flags|caste flag]]>| When this token is added to a random creature summoning effect, it excludes any creature with the specified [[Interaction_token#Creature_and_Caste_Flags|caste flag]]. This token may be used multiple times per interaction effect; creatures which possess any of the indicated flags will never be summoned.
|-| {{text anchor|IE_HAVE_FAST_EFFORTLESS_GAIT_SPEED}}| Within I_EFFECT:SUMMON_UNIT| <minimum [[Gait#Speed|gait speed]]>| When this token is added to a random creature summoning effect, it narrows down the selection to creatures which have at least one [[gait]] with an [[Creature_token#GAIT|<energy expenditure>]] of 0 and a [[Creature_token#GAIT|<max speed>]] less than or equal to the specified <minimum gait speed> ("less than" because lower is faster in the scale used for [[Gait#Speed|gait speed]]). [http://www.bay12forums.com/smf/index.php?topic=169696.msg8243222#msg8243222]
|-| {{text anchor|IE_ALL_SLOW_EFFORTLESS_GAIT_SPEED}}| Within I_EFFECT:SUMMON_UNIT| <maximum [[Gait#Speed|gait speed]]>| When this token is added to a random creature summoning effect, it excludes any creatures which have at least one [[gait]] with an [[Creature_token#GAIT|<energy expenditure>]] of 0 and a [[Creature_token#GAIT|<max speed>]] value less than or equal to the specified <maximum gait speed> (note that larger values are slower in the scale used for [[Gait#Speed|gait speed]]). [http://www.bay12forums.com/smf/index.php?topic=169696.msg8243222#msg8243222]
|-| {{text anchor|IE_TIME_RANGE}}| Within I_EFFECT:SUMMON_UNIT| <minimum [[Time|ticks]]>:<maximum [[Time|ticks]]>| The summoned unit vanishes in a puff of smoke once a certain amount of time has elapsed. The time limit is a randomly selected number of ticks within the specified minimum-maximum time range. The unit will persist indefinitely if this token is omitted.
|-| {{text anchor|IE_MAKE_PET_IF_POSSIBLE}}| Within I_EFFECT:SUMMON_UNIT|| Makes the summoned unit behave as a pet of the unit who performed the summoning interaction.
|-| {{text anchor|GENERATED}}| Global| | Indicates that this is a generated interaction. Cannot be specified in user-defined raws.

|}

==Usage==
To enable a particular type of creature to use an interaction directly, the [[creature token]] <code>[[Creature_token#CAN_DO_INTERACTION|[CAN_DO_INTERACTION:<interaction name>]]]</code> should be added to its creature raws (replacing '<interaction name>' with the ID of the desired interaction; for an interaction called <code>[INTERACTION:CLEANING]</code> in the raws, the ID would be "CLEANING"), followed by a series of [CDI:...] tokens as detailed below.

Interactions can also be granted to individual creatures via [[syndrome]]s using the syndrome effect token <code>[[Syndrome#CE_CAN_DO_INTERACTION|[CE_CAN_DO_INTERACTION]]]</code> followed by <code>[[Interaction_token#INTERACTION|[CDI:INTERACTION:<interaction name>]]]</code> and additional CDI tokens as required.

The following is a list of valid CDI tokens. Precede them with "CDI:" in the style of <code>[CDI:ADV_NAME:Clean]</code>, for example.
{| {{prettytable}}|- bgcolor="#C0C0C0"
! Token
! Arguments
! Description
|-| {{text anchor|INTERACTION}}| ID| Specifies which interaction can be performed. This is only needed following [[Syndrome#Special_Effects|CE_CAN_DO_INTERACTION]]; there's no need to include this after [[Creature_token#CAN_DO_INTERACTION|CAN_DO_INTERACTION]] as the latter allows you to specify the interaction directly (as explained [[Interaction_token#Usage|above]]).
|-| {{text anchor|ADV_NAME}}| text| Specifies the name of the interaction as it will appear on the [[Adventurer_mode|adventure mode]] 'powers/abilities' menu.
|-| {{text anchor|TOKEN}}| ID| Specifies a reference for the interaction graphics icon as it will appear on the [[Adventurer_mode|adventure mode]] 'powers/abilities' menu{{verify}}.
|-| {{text anchor|TARGET}}| target ID, target types| Specifies how the creature chooses what to target. Target ID refers to an I_TARGET defined in the interaction itself. Multiple target types can be specified. If no target is specified, creature will target any available target within range, even through walls.  Valid target types:
* '''LINE_OF_SIGHT''' - the source needs to be able to see the target
* '''TOUCHABLE''' - the source needs to be able to touch the target
* '''DISTURBER_ONLY''' - the target must be whoever disturbed the source (this is currently only relevant to [[mummy|mummies]], allowing them to curse solely the unit who disturbed their [[tomb|resting place]])
* '''SELF_ALLOWED''' - the target can be the source
* '''SELF_ONLY''' - the target '''must''' be the source
|-| {{text anchor|TARGET_RANGE}}| target ID, range| Determines the maximum distance from the interaction user (in [[tile]]s) at which something can be considered a valid target. For [[Interaction_token#SOLID_GLOB|SOLID_GLOB]], [[Interaction_token#SHARP_ROCK|SHARP_ROCK]], [[Interaction_token#LIQUID_GLOB|LIQUID_GLOB]] and [[Interaction_token#FIREBALL|FIREBALL]] breath attacks, also determines how far the projectiles can fly before falling to the ground.
|-| {{text anchor|MAX_TARGET_NUMBER}}| ID, number| Specifies the maximum number of things that can be selected for a particular I_TARGET.
|-| {{text anchor|LOCATION_HINT}}| Location Hint| Prevents CPU-controlled creatures from using the interaction unless they are in a location which meets the specified criteria. See [[Interaction_token#IE_LOCATION|above]] for a list of valid location hint values.
|-| {{text anchor|USAGE_HINT}}| Usage hint token| Indicates when and how CPU-controlled creatures will use the interaction. If no hint is specified in fortress mode, the interaction will be performed at every opportunity in combat. Multiple usage hints may be specified. Valid values:
* '''GREETING''' - Creatures will target 'friendly' creatures, usually at random.
* '''ATTACK''' - Targets enemy creatures in combat.  If the interaction specifies SELF_ONLY, CPU-controlled creatures will never use it.
* '''DEFEND''' - Used in combat. Creature will target itself.
* '''FLEEING''' - Used when fleeing an enemy.  Creature will target itself.
* '''CLEAN_SELF''' - Creature targets itself when its body is covered with [[contaminant]]s.
* '''CLEAN_FRIEND''' - As above, but targets other friendly units instead.
* '''NEGATIVE_SOCIAL_RESPONSE''' - Used when a creature is expressing contempt (for example, to a murderer). This is used in the default spitting interaction, for example.
* '''TORMENT''' - This is also used in the default spitting interaction, and is presumably used in a similar context.
* '''MINOR_BLESSING''' - Used in divination dice blessings. Targets the roller.
* '''MEDIUM_BLESSING''' - Used in divination dice blessings. Targets the roller.
* '''MINOR_CURSE''' - Used in divination dice curses. Targets the roller.
* '''MEDIUM_CURSE''' - Used in divination dice curses. Targets the roller.
* '''MAJOR_CURSE''' - Used in disturbance and deity curses.  Targets the tomb disturber/temple defiler.
|-| {{text anchor|WAIT_PERIOD}}| number| The creature must wait the specified number of [[time|ticks]] before being able to use the interaction again. The delay defaults to 20 ticks if this is omitted. Setting it to 0 removes the delay altogether.
Note: A WAIT_PERIOD of 10 is 10 ticks long in [[fortress mode]], but only 1 tick long in [[adventurer mode]].
|-| {{text anchor|FREE_ACTION}}|| Indicates that performing the interaction doesn't take any time.
|-| {{text anchor|BP_REQUIRED}}| Body part criteria| Indicates that a particular body part must be present in order to perform the interaction. Criteria are '''BY_CATEGORY:'''[[Body_token#CATEGORY|category]], '''BY_TYPE:'''type (GRASP, for example),  or '''BY_TOKEN:'''[[Body_token#BP|token]] (uses the body part ID). See [[Body_token|body token]].
|-| {{text anchor|VERBAL}}| | Only creatures that [[Creature_token#CAN_SPEAK|can speak]] will be able to use the interaction.  Might also be needed for VERBAL_SPEECH.
|-| {{text anchor|VERBAL_SPEECH}}| text set| Specifies what the creature says when they perform the interaction. Text sets are defined in text_* raws.
|-| {{text anchor|CAN_BE_MUTUAL}}| | Presumably allows two creatures with the same interaction to use it on each other simultaneously, for example, cats cleaning each other.
|-| {{text anchor|VERB}}| self:other:mutual| When a creature uses the interaction, a combat report message will be displayed in the form:

[interaction user(s)] [VERB text] [target creature (if applicable)]

The 'self' text is presented when describing the interaction in the second person (that is, when the interaction is carried out by the player character in [[adventure mode]]), the 'other' text is presented when describing it in the third person, and the 'mutual' text is presented when the interaction is carried out in a [[Interaction_token#CAN_BE_MUTUAL|mutual]] fashion.

[CDI:VERB:lick:licks:lick each other]

[CDI:VERB:gesture:gestures:NA]
|-| {{text anchor|VERB_REVERSE}}| ?| ?
|-| {{text anchor|TARGET_VERB}}| self:other| When a creature uses the interaction, a message will display, describing the target as doing this.
[CDI:TARGET_VERB:shudder and begin to move:shudders and begins to move]
|-| {{text anchor|FLOW}}| [[#Breath Attack Types|Breath attack token]]| Can be used with interactions that have [[Interaction_token#I_EFFECT|[I_EFFECT:MATERIAL_EMISSION]]] and [[Interaction_token#IT_LOCATION|[IT_LOCATION:CONTEXT_MATERIAL]]] (or [[Interaction_token#IT_MATERIAL|[IT_MATERIAL:CONTEXT_MATERIAL]]]) to make the interaction emit a special flow type. Valid values:
* '''[[Interaction_token#FIREBALL|FIREBALL]]'''
* '''[[Interaction_token#FIREJET|FIREJET]]'''
* '''[[Interaction_token#DRAGONFIRE|DRAGONFIRE]]'''.
|-| {{text anchor|MATERIAL}}| [[Material token]]:[[Interaction_token#Breath_Attack_Types|Breath attack token]]| Can be used with interactions that have [[Interaction_token#I_EFFECT|[I_EFFECT:MATERIAL_EMISSION]]] and [[Interaction_token#IT_LOCATION|[IT_LOCATION:CONTEXT_MATERIAL]]] (or [[Interaction_token#IT_MATERIAL|[IT_MATERIAL:CONTEXT_MATERIAL]]]) to make the interaction emit the specified material in the manner described by the [[Interaction_token#Breath_Attack_Types|breath attack token]] used.
|}

==Breath attacks==
Breath attacks are controlled by the MATERIAL_EMISSION interaction, like so:

  [CAN_DO_INTERACTION:MATERIAL_EMISSION]
  		[CDI:ADV_NAME:Breath custom material]
  		[CDI:USAGE_HINT:ATTACK]
  		[CDI:BP_REQUIRED:BY_CATEGORY:MOUTH]
  		[CDI:MATERIAL:LOCAL_CREATURE_MAT:CUSTOMMATERIAL:TRAILING_VAPOR_FLOW]
  		[CDI:TARGET:C:LINE_OF_SIGHT]
  		[CDI:TARGET_RANGE:C:15]
  		[CDI:MAX_TARGET_NUMBER:C:1]
  		[CDI:WAIT_PERIOD:50]

The most important part is this line:

  [CDI:MATERIAL:LOCAL_CREATURE_MAT:CUSTOMMATERIAL:TRAILING_VAPOR_FLOW]

The CDI refers to CAN_DO_INTERACTION; the MATERIAL states that this line shows what the material is. LOCAL_CREATURE_MAT:CUSTOMMATERIAL is your material, and TRAILING_VAPOR_FLOW refers to the breath attack type. Other types are seen below. Also important is this line:

  [CDI:TARGET:C:LINE_OF_SIGHT]

LINE_OF_SIGHT refers to where the target C may be; others include SELF_ALLOWED (presumably like LINE_OF_SIGHT, but with the creature allowed to target itself), SELF_ONLY (preferable for undirected attacks) and TOUCHABLE (for up-close attacks, as trailing flows tend to be).

===Breath Attack Types===

    '''[CDI:MATERIAL:<[[material token]]>:<material emission type>]'''

Is used to emit a specific material in a specific manner. A list of valid emission types can be found below.

Examples:

    [CDI:MATERIAL:INORGANIC:GABBRO:[[Interaction_token#SHARP_ROCK|SHARP_ROCK]]]
shoots a sharp [[gabbro]] rock
    [CDI:MATERIAL:PLANT_MAT:GRASS_CAVE_WHEAT:MILL:[[Interaction_token#UNDIRECTED_DUST|UNDIRECTED_DUST]]]
releases a cloud of [[Cave wheat|dwarven wheat flour]]
    [CDI:MATERIAL:CREATURE_MAT:DWARF:TEARS:[[Interaction_token#SPATTER_LIQUID|SPATTER_LIQUID]]]
creates a pool of [[dwarf|dwarven]] tears


    '''[CDI:FLOW:<flow emission type>]'''

Is used to emit one of the special hardcoded flow types ([[Interaction_token#FIREBALL|FIREBALL]], [[Interaction_token#FIREJET|FIREJET]]  or [[Interaction_token#DRAGONFIRE|DRAGONFIRE]]).

Example:

    [CDI:FLOW:[[Interaction_token#DRAGONFIRE|DRAGONFIRE]]]


{| {{prettytable}}|- bgcolor="#ddd"
! Token
! Usage Type
! Description|-| {{text anchor|TRAILING_DUST_FLOW}}| MATERIAL| Shoots a trail of solid dust at the target. Appears to use [[cave-in]] dust physics, as the dust cloud will fling around anything it comes in contact with (including the creature who emitted it), making it capable of smashing creatures into the ground and flinging them over walls. Creatures caught in the dust cloud will be [[contaminant|covered]] with dust; this will trigger any associated [[Syndrome#SYN_CONTACT|contact syndromes]].|-| {{text anchor|TRAILING_VAPOR_FLOW}}| MATERIAL| Shoots a trail of liquid mist at the target. Creatures caught in the vapor will be [[contaminant|covered]] with the condensed liquid; this will trigger any associated [[Syndrome#SYN_CONTACT|contact syndromes]].|-| {{text anchor|TRAILING_GAS_FLOW}}| MATERIAL| Shoots a trail of gaseous substance at the target. This can be inhaled, triggering any associated [[Syndrome#SYN_INHALED|inhalation syndromes]].|-| {{text anchor|TRAILING_ITEM_FLOW}}:[[item token]]| MATERIAL| Shoots a "cloud" of items at the target, leaving piles of this item on the floor.  Note that this does ''not'' create the actual items or use falling item mechanics (meaning no flying daggers or Touhou-style barrages, unfortunately).  Instead, this token acts as [[Interaction_token#TRAILING_GAS_FLOW|TRAILING_GAS_FLOW]], except that the material will use its ''normal'' temperature - for example, a breath attack of steel anvils will envelop the target in a "burst of steel".|-| {{text anchor|UNDIRECTED_DUST}}| MATERIAL| The creature releases a cloud of solid dust which spreads and dissipates. Similar to [[Interaction_token#TRAILING_DUST_FLOW|TRAILING_DUST_FLOW]], but undirected, thus affecting a larger area but losing the distance - range is roughly the same as that of a cave-in. Creature will attack as normal. <s>DO NOT USE THIS TAG UNLESS YOU WANT TO KILL THE CREATURE AND EVERYTHING NEAR IT AND SEND PEOPLE FLYING.</s> You know you want to.|-| {{text anchor|UNDIRECTED_VAPOR}}| MATERIAL| The creature releases a cloud of liquid mist which spreads and dissipates. Similar to [[Interaction_token#TRAILING_VAPOR_FLOW|TRAILING_VAPOR_FLOW]], but undirected, thus affecting a larger area but losing the distance.|-| {{text anchor|UNDIRECTED_GAS}}| MATERIAL| The creature releases a cloud of gaseous material which spreads and dissipates. Similar to [[Interaction_token#TRAILING_GAS_FLOW|TRAILING_GAS_FLOW]], but undirected, thus affecting a larger area but losing the distance.|-| {{text anchor|UNDIRECTED_ITEM_CLOUD}}:[[item token]]| MATERIAL| The creature releases a "cloud" of items at the target, leaving piles of this item on the floor.  The same comments apply as [[Interaction_token#TRAILING_ITEM_FLOW|TRAILING_ITEM_FLOW]].|-| {{text anchor|WEATHER_CREEPING_DUST}}| MATERIAL| Creates a cloud of creeping dust. Not usable by creatures.|-| {{text anchor|WEATHER_CREEPING_VAPOR}}| MATERIAL| Creates a cloud of creeping vapor. Not usable by creatures.|-| {{text anchor|WEATHER_CREEPING_GAS}}| MATERIAL| Creates a cloud of gas that appears at the edge of the map and slowly creeps across the map. Not usable by creatures.|-| {{text anchor|WEATHER_FALLING_MATERIAL}}| MATERIAL| Causes it to start raining a particular material. If the material is solid at the outdoor temperatures, it will snow the material instead. Can transfer [[Syndrome#SYN_CONTACT|contact syndromes]]. Regardless of the nature of the material, being caught in it will give dwarves the negative [[thought]] of being 'caught in freakish weather lately'. Not usable by creatures.|-| {{text anchor|SOLID_GLOB}}| MATERIAL| Shoots a [[Item_token#GLOB|solid glob]] of spinning substance at the target, leaving a symbol similar to broken arrows, if it misses. Essentially a projectile weapon. If the [[Interaction_token#WAIT_PERIOD|cooldown rate]] is short enough, some creatures with this breath attack will not move, preferring instead to hold position and shoot globs at their enemies, even when they are right next to them.|-| {{text anchor|SHARP_ROCK}}| MATERIAL| Just like [[Interaction_token#SOLID_GLOB|SOLID_GLOB]], but more harmful, as it shoots a sharpened [[Item_token#ROCK|solid chunk]] of material instead.|-| {{text anchor|LIQUID_GLOB}}| MATERIAL| Shoots a [[Item_token#LIQUID_MISC|liquid glob]] of substance at the target.  [[Syndrome#SYN_CONTACT|Contact syndromes]] will take effect if the glob hits the target's exposed skin.|-| {{text anchor|SPATTER_POWDER}}| MATERIAL| Creates a [[contaminant|pile of powder]] at the specified location.|-| {{text anchor|SPATTER_LIQUID}}| MATERIAL| Creates a [[contaminant|pool of liquid]] at the specified location.|-| {{text anchor|WEB_SPRAY}}| MATERIAL| Emits a burst of [[web]]s that entangle target creatures.|-| {{text anchor|DRAGONFIRE}}| FLOW| Emits a wide cone of [[dragon]] [[fire]] that burns target creatures at a scorching {{ct|50000}}.|-| {{text anchor|FIREJET}}| FLOW| Emits a narrow cone of [[fire]] that burns target creatures at {{ct|11000}}.|-| {{text anchor|FIREBALL}}| FLOW| Emits a fireball that burns the target creature.|}

Keep in mind that you can give a creature multiple breath attacks, which appears to make the creature choose between them at random.  Creatures cannot use the WEATHER effects, these being reserved for regional interactions.

One major difference between GAS, VAPOR, and DUST is that if the material cannot exist in the specified state at the current temperature, it will automatically be created at a temperature allowing it to exist.  So if you create a vapor spray that uses rock or metal as a material, that spray will be created at the material's melting point, setting everything it touches on fire.  You can also create a freezing spray by using a custom material that has extremely low melting and/or boiling points.

If you give a creature a material breath attack, be aware that it will be caught in the attack more frequently than its targets.  Make sure to make your creatures immune to their own breath weapons!

==Creature and Caste Flags==

Certain interaction and syndrome effects (currently limited to [[Interaction_token#I_EFFECT|[IE_SUMMON_UNIT]]] and [[Syndrome#CE_BODY_TRANSFORMATION|[CE_BODY_TRANSFORMATION]]]) permit modders to specify the required/forbidden creature and caste flags of the desired creature(s). These are a collection of internal flags which are derived from [[Creature_token|creature tokens]] but are not necessarily identical to them. The following lists contain creature and caste flag names as provided by Toady One in a FotF reply [http://www.bay12forums.com/smf//index.php?topic=169696.msg8099138#msg8099138] (valid as of 0.47.04).
