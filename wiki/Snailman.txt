'''Snail men''' are [[animal people]] variants of the common [[snail]], who can inhabit most [[savage]] [[biome]]s. They spawn in groups of 1-3 individuals and are generally content to keep to themselves, but may pick fights if provoked. In terms of size, they are a little over half the weight of the average [[dwarf]]. Although standard snails have no legs, snail men have legs, which is shown in their sprites.

Like other savage animal people, snail men can join [[civilization]]s, become [[historical figure]]s, appear as [[visitor]]s and be playable in [[adventurer mode]].

Some dwarves [[Preferences|like]] snail men for their ''shells''.
