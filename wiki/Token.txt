In ''Dwarf Fortress'', a '''token''' is a piece of text that defines the properties of an object.  An "object" could be a material, a type of tissue, an organ, a piece of armor, a creature, a biome, a civilisation, or anything else in the game.  A "property" could be how large something is, what it is made from, its melting temperature, its name, its biome preference (for civilisations) or anything else that makes it unique.  All information associated with the properties of an object in the game is defined using tokens. Tokens are used in the [[raws]], which can be easily [[modding|modified]], allowing users to create (and distribute) new content.
