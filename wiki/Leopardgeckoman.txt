'''Leopard gecko men''' are humanoid versions of the common [[leopard gecko]] and a [[Creature|species]] of unremarkable [[animal people]], found in [[savage]] [[desert]]s. They are a bit over half the size of [[dwarf|dwarves]] and spawn in groups of 1-5 individuals, who should pose no threat to [[Dwarf|dwarves]] unless provoked. All leopard gecko men are born with Legendary [[skill]] in [[Climber|climbing]].

Like other savage animal people, leopard gecko men may occasionally join [[civilization]]s, becoming full-fledged citizens who may appear in your fortress as [[visitor]]s or be playable in [[adventurer mode]].

Some dwarves [[Preferences|like]] leopard gecko men for their ''coloration'' and their ''amazing sticky feet''.

{{D for Dwarf}}
Contrary to popular belief, leopard gecko men will not sell your dwarves wagon insurance.
