'''Sards''' are unremarkable low-value [[gem]]s found in [[sedimentary layer]]s.

==In real life==
Similar to [[carnelian]], sard is a low-value, dark reddish-brown variety of the mineral chalcedony. The terms sard and carnelian are sometimes used interchangeably, but sard tends to refer to harder and darker varieties of this stone that are less prized.
