Sometimes, [[dwarves]] will grow particularly '''attached''' to a [[weapon]] (or more precisely anything regularly used as a weapon by the same dwarf in combat, ie. a wrestler might also become attached to a bracelet used in combat/sparring) or piece of [[armor]], such that if they become attached enough, they will [[name]] it. The armor/weapon will then be listed as a named object and gain the [[artifact]] flag, although its value and effectiveness{{verify}} will remain the same. What causes dwarves to name their weapons is unknown - time alone will suffice (though it may take a ''very'' long time), but slaying an important [[historical figure]], such as a [[forgotten beast]], will often be enough. A weapon having a long kill list will also contribute to its naming. A weapon or piece of armor, even a [[shield]] or [[greaves]], may be named if it only had a single kill. (''Apparently, this particular artifact-ish status also provides a 2x to-hit chance.'')

After the weapon has been named, it will become impossible to [[melt]] (''much like an [[artifact]] clearly would be'') though other weapons '''can''' be used by the same dwarf.. If the dwarf dies, the weapon will be forbidden for use until all dwarves that slew something with that particular weapon (according to its kill list) at any given moment (before and after its naming) are properly buried in a [[coffin]]. If any of the slayers' bodies have been destroyed, the weapon cannot be used again.

Attachment is not entirely restricted to warriors' military items; [[Performer|bards]] can become attached to their [[instrument]]s and [[scholar]]s to their [[scroll]]s, to provide two examples.
