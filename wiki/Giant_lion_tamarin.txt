'''Giant lion tamarins''' are much larger [[Creature|cousins]] of the normal [[lion tamarin]] found in [[savage]] [[tropical]] moist broadleaf [[forest]]s. They are solitary and only spawn one at a time. Being 3 times larger than a [[dwarf]], giant lion tamarins are more than a match for a peasant in combat, but they are benign and will only fight if cornered. All giant lion tamarins possess Legendary [[skill]] in [[Climber|climbing]] and are born adults.

Giant lion tamarins possess the standard high pet value of giant creatures, making them valuable [[pet]]s if [[Animal trainer|trained]]. Additionally, they can be used for the [[meat industry]] through hunting or if the player manages to capture a breeding pair, though they are noticeably short-lived animals, only living up to 3 years at most - because they're born fully sized, they should be butchered immediately. They are considered exotic [[mount]]s, so you may encounter [[Elf|elves]] riding them into battle in the event of a [[siege]].

Some dwarves [[Preferences|like]] giant lion tamarins for their ''small size'' and their ''manes''.
