This is an (extended) transcript of the old "Consolidated Development Page" as it was before the redesign of the ''Dwarf Fortress'' webpage. It includes all long-and short-term arcs, core-items, Reqs, Bloats and Powergoals. The page itself may be found [http://www.bay12games.com/dwarves/dev_single.html here].

Note that, due to the page's age, many of the specific goals here may no longer be directly applicable; however, they provide a general overview of the original thought-process behind Dwarf Fortress' development, and the broader arcs are still frequently referred to in reference to current development.

=Arcs=

An arc is a number of features that add to one theme-field. Many of an arc's features can, but don't need to, be done simultaneously - as such, the status of completeness can't be determined that easily. 

Short-term arcs are the arcs that are likely to be done in the near future. Long-term arcs, on the other hand, will be added much later or even after version 1.0 is done.

| BUSTLING TOWN ARC
| The towns should be more structured. The peasants need to do less aimless wandering and more standard activities. There need to be various items in town outside of what's in the stores. There need to be guards, and the keep/mead hall should be more interesting.

|-
| FIRE AND LIGHTING ARC 
|  The lighting in caves is artificial right now. It should be pitch black. This is also true of moonless cloudy nights. Once that's in, your adventurer will want fire. Fire can also come up in dwarf mode in various ways.
| [[#Core14|Core14]], [[#Core55|Core55]], [[#Req96|Req96]] and [[#PowerGoal 150|PowerGoal150]].
|-
|  BURROWS, TRANSPORTION AND AUTOMATION ARC
|  Make dwarves live and restrict their movements to sections ("burrows") of the cave to reduce the amount of hauling. This includes many of the haul/pile reqs. Other workshops could be automated, while the work order system could be made more robust to decrease the amount of interface fiddling required to produce glass and soap, for example.

|-
|  ADVANCED HELP ARC  
|  Yeah, dwarves has a steep learning curve. Tutorials and advisors could help with this, as well as decent in-game help.
|  [[#Core19|Core19]], [[#Core22|Core22]] and [[#Core58|Core58]].
|-
|  CARAVAN ARC  
|  As a prelude to armies, we'll have caravans actually move around the world map rather than just appear at your outpost. They'll move between each city on the map, though we'll try to stay away from supporting a real economy for the time being. You should be able to find items you traded in your fortress in adventure mode, and a caravan could come to your fortress with an adventure mode item.
|  [[#Core3|Core3]], [[#Core38|Core38]], [[#Core81|Core81]], [[#Req21|Req21]], [[#Req132|Req132]], [[#Req133|Req133]], [[#Req175|Req175]], [[#Req204|Req204]], [[#Req218|Req218]], [[#Req220|Req220]], [[#Req260|Req260]], [[#Req279|Req279]], [[#Req364|Req364]], [[#Req463|Req463]], [[#Req516|Req516]], [[#Req555|Req555]], [[#Bloat155|Bloat155]], [[#Bloat263|Bloat263]], [[#Bloat267|Bloat267]], [[#PowerGoal 24|PowerGoal24]], [[#PowerGoal 33|PowerGoal33]], [[#PowerGoal 56|PowerGoal56]] and [[#PowerGoal 148|PowerGoal148]].
|-
|  COUNTY ARC 
| You should be able to develop a larger settlement outside the confines of the immediate play area. 
| [[#Core28|Core28]], [[#Core29|Core29]] and [[#PowerGoal 53|PowerGoal53]].
|-
|    ARMY ARC 
| You should be able to control patrols and then armies in dwarf mode. The adventurer should be able to both go with and command armies. In dwarf mode, you should have the option to control your individual patrol members as you would in adventure mode. Entities should war with each other from bandit and monster raids to full fledged wars. Upset entities could patrol near their sites, leading to new wilderness encounters etc. 
| [[#Core26|Core26]], [[#Core27|Core27]], [[#Core35|Core35]], [[#Core45|Core45]], [[#Core46|Core46]], [[#Req18|Req18]], [[#Req29|Req29]], [[#Req61|Req61]], [[#Req71|Req71]], [[#Req81|Req81]], [[#Req125|Req125]], [[#Req126|Req126]], [[#Req221|Req221]], [[#Req273|Req273]], [[#Req301|Req301]], [[#Req371|Req371]], [[#Req398|Req398]], [[#Req414|Req414]], [[#Req417|Req417]], [[#Req427|Req427]], [[#Req444|Req444]], [[#Req449|Req449]], [[#Req475|Req475]], [[#Req478|Req478]], [[#Req496|Req496]], [[#Req503|Req503]], [[#Req545|Req545]], [[#Req571|Req571]], [[#Bloat44|Bloat44]], [[#Bloat117|Bloat117]], [[#Bloat130|Bloat130]], [[#Bloat131|Bloat131]], [[#Bloat175|Bloat175]], [[#Bloat289|Bloat289]], [[#PowerGoal 1|PowerGoal1]], [[#PowerGoal 2|PowerGoal2]], [[#PowerGoal 3|PowerGoal3]], [[#PowerGoal 4|PowerGoal4]], [[#PowerGoal 5|PowerGoal5]], [[#PowerGoal 6|PowerGoal6]], [[#PowerGoal 7|PowerGoal7]], [[#PowerGoal 8|PowerGoal8]], [[#PowerGoal 11|PowerGoal11]], [[#PowerGoal 17|PowerGoal17]], [[#PowerGoal 40|PowerGoal40]], [[#PowerGoal 59|PowerGoal59]], [[#PowerGoal 70|PowerGoal70]], [[#PowerGoal 71|PowerGoal71]], [[#PowerGoal 76|PowerGoal76]], [[#PowerGoal 92|PowerGoal92]], [[#PowerGoal 98|PowerGoal98]], [[#PowerGoal 119|PowerGoal119]], [[#PowerGoal 127|PowerGoal127]], [[#PowerGoal 130|PowerGoal130]], [[#PowerGoal 138|PowerGoal138]], [[#PowerGoal 140|PowerGoal140]], [[#PowerGoal 141|PowerGoal141]], [[#PowerGoal 142|PowerGoal142]], [[#PowerGoal 143|PowerGoal143]], [[#PowerGoal 144|PowerGoal144]] and [[#PowerGoal 147|PowerGoal147]].
|-
|  NEMESIS ARC 
| The civilization leaders should be fleshed out in many ways. 
| [[#Core11|Core11]], [[#Core15|Core15]], [[#Core40|Core40]], [[#Req161|Req161]], [[#Req277|Req277]], [[#Bloat48|Bloat48]], [[#Bloat68|Bloat68]], [[#Bloat176|Bloat176]], [[#PowerGoal 98|PowerGoal98]], [[#PowerGoal 101|PowerGoal101]], [[#PowerGoal 102|PowerGoal102]] and [[#PowerGoal 122|PowerGoal122]].
|-
|  RELATIONSHIPS ARC 
| You should be able to take a spouse, make a household, and create playable heirs as an adventurer. The dwarven relationships and personalities can also be expanded upon. 
| [[#Core59|Core59]], [[#Core60|Core60]], [[#Bloat51|Bloat51]], [[#Bloat93|Bloat93]], [[#Bloat95|Bloat95]], [[#Bloat105|Bloat105]], [[#Bloat123|Bloat123]], [[#Bloat374|Bloat374]], [[#Bloat375|Bloat375]], [[#Bloat380|Bloat380]], [[#PowerGoal 20|PowerGoal20]], [[#PowerGoal 21|PowerGoal21]], [[#PowerGoal 109|PowerGoal109]] and [[#PowerGoal 119|PowerGoal119]].
|-
|  DIPLOMACY ARC 
|  There should be a lot more diplomacy between your outpost and the outside world, especially as you get more nobles. Right now there's hardly anything. 
| [[#Core33|Core33]], [[#Core62|Core62]], [[#Core63|Core63]], [[#Req174|Req174]], [[#Req177|Req177]], [[#Req291|Req291]], [[#Req451|Req451]], [[#Req527|Req527]], [[#Req542|Req542]], [[#Req543|Req543]], [[#Bloat31|Bloat31]], [[#Bloat72|Bloat72]], [[#Bloat73|Bloat73]], [[#PowerGoal 10|PowerGoal10]], [[#PowerGoal 98|PowerGoal98]] and [[#PowerGoal 101|PowerGoal101]].
|-
|  GHOSTS ARC  
| When you take an adventurer back to a fortress, it could afford to be a lot more interesting. Since it keeps track of all the dwarves that ever lived or died in each outpost, it might as well utilize them. When the civs fight in world gen, it could also create ruins from earlier times, and you could go to these places (old castles, temples, etc.). 
| [[#Core67|Core67]], [[#Core68|Core68]], [[#Core69|Core69]], [[#Core70|Core70]], [[#Bloat21|Bloat21]], [[#PowerGoal 11|PowerGoal11]], [[#PowerGoal 92|PowerGoal92]] and [[#PowerGoal 107|PowerGoal107]].
|-
|  AFFILIATION ARC 
|  You should be able to rise to the top of an entity (civilization, town, etc.) in adventure mode. While the full set of responsibilities that would entail will have to wait, it should at least be possible to attain this status for the first version. You should be able to do things for individuals. This could earn you favors from sleeping in their home and food gifts all the way to a marriage offer. There can be smaller entities like bandits and cults which could offer more unsavory tasks for similar privileges (steal, kill, kidnap, etc.). Can earn right to sleep in the large hall in town if you've become affiliated with them, but vagrancy needs to be punished and the camping must be harsher before this is meaningful.

|-
|      SCENARIOS ARC 
| Character generation is due for a major change. The current plan is to have an interactive history generator that takes your character from birth to a playable age, incorporating them into the fabric of the world. Pressing "Play Now!" would answer the questions automatically, perhaps with a strong tendency to place you in dire/interesting situations. 
| [[#Core75|Core75]], [[#Core76|Core76]], [[#Req214|Req214]], [[#Req317|Req317]], [[#Bloat26|Bloat26]] and [[#Bloat143|Bloat143]].
|-
|  LIFE CYCLE ARC
|  Right now, there are no births and no aging in the towns and other populations. From the founding of a town, it should instead simulate and track these things during world creation. This makes the world much more interesting and also more resilient to changes inflicted by the player. At the same time, it creates instability unrelated to the actions of the player, so it has to be done carefully.

|-
|  ARTIFACT ARC  
| Special items made by the dwarves aren't very interesting right now, and there's not much for an adventurer to do with them. These objects should have magical powers and they should have a huge influence on the actions of entities that come into contact with them. Even if your adventurer can't make use of a particular artifact, you could arrange for buyers in the nobility, and use those opportunitites to get a home or good entity standing, for instance.

|-
|  CRIME AND PUNISHMENT ARC 
| There should be mild punishments for mild crimes, for instance. This could include making the drunks in the town more interesting and adding bar fights, as well as proper thievery, arrest, imprisonment, execution...

|-
|   ADVENTURER SKILLS ARC  
| It's nice to have all those jobs and professions sitting around in the dwarf mode. The adventurer should be able to do these things, especially those skills related to survival in the wilderness. Eventually you'll be able to place constructions, create a home and have your own site on the map. 
| [[#Core84|Core84]], [[#Core85|Core85]], [[#Core86|Core86]], [[#Req32|Req32]], [[#Req34|Req34]], [[#Req99|Req99]], [[#Req107|Req107]], [[#Req168|Req168]], [[#Req236|Req236]], [[#Req302|Req302]], [[#Req327|Req327]], [[#Req491|Req491]], [[#Bloat160|Bloat160]], [[#Bloat317|Bloat317]], [[#Bloat380|Bloat380]], [[#PowerGoal 9|PowerGoal9]], [[#PowerGoal 15|PowerGoal15]] and [[#PowerGoal 103|PowerGoal103]].
|-
|  ADVENTURER PARTIES AND ENTITY  
| As an adventurer with followers, you should be able to make your own entity definition. If you have enough people, you might be able to delegate orders and control them more strategically. You should also be able to control each member in a party of adventurers you make yourself. You could lead one and the others follow (as it is currently) or control them all, particularly during tense situations where you don't want to count on the AI.

| DUNGEON ARC  
| Improve kobold and goblin areas and civilizations with eyes on expanding entity definitions and future random generation. Includes adding entity definitions and tags for more primitive humanoids like lizardmen. Make mega-beasts fit in better with the world.

|  HUMANOID ARC 
|  Make non-player dwarf fortresses look more like player made fortresses and act like them to the extent that it's reasonable. Improve elves as in the Dungeon Arc, with multi-tile tree dwellings.

|-
|  LANGUAGE ARC  
|  The in-game languages need a better framework, as many simple name formulations are impossible in the current system, and it wouldn't hurt to add a basic grammar and phonetics at this time as well. In addition, paper, engraved writing, books, poems, songs, etc. could all be explored in the different game modes in various ways.
| [[#Core97|Core97]], [[#Core98|Core98]], [[#Core99|Core99]] and [[#Core100|Core100]].
|-
| RANDOMIZATION AND RAWS ARC
| More things need to make it out to the raws, and when they arrive, there should be some ability to randomize what you get in play. Current raw objects such as creatures, entities, plants, metals or even stone should also be randomizable. This doesn't just include randomizing an existing entry, but, more importantly, the creation of entirely new objects. This behavior should be controlled by the world parameters so that you can run anything from a stock universe to a complete replacement of all existing raw objects. In worlds with random objects, the random objects need to be introduced to the player in such a way that familiarity can be gained (involving descriptions, back stories, etc.) so that it isn't just a mess of static with garbage names.

! style="width:40%"|Requirements
|-
| HIGH LEVEL PLOTS AND DIPLOMACY
| Various intrigue and interesting not-necessarily-violent conflict between entities and individuals. Once you place the actors in place, they should act according to their wants and the wants of their associated entities based on the strength of those ties. Both adventurers and dwarf fortresses can become immersed in the push and pull which arises from the AI. This is already true to some extent (the current quests are all created from the surroundings and entity ties), but these effects can be made pervasive. Since armies and invasions will be done before we get here, there will already be some of this AI in place to work with. 
| [[#Core30|Core30]], [[#Core33|Core33]], [[#Req131|Req131]], [[#PowerGoal 18|PowerGoal18]], [[#PowerGoal 47|PowerGoal47]], [[#PowerGoal 57|PowerGoal57]], [[#PowerGoal 65|PowerGoal65]], [[#PowerGoal 95|PowerGoal95]] and [[#PowerGoal 124|PowerGoal124]].
|-   
| LATE GAME 
| As you kill the large creatures, the world becomes more... boring. The game can be prepared for this kind of change and move over into a sort of fairy-tale/Beowulf/Robert E Howard type of hybrid with human civs and occasional monsters so that things continue to be interesting. This already happens naturally in a way, but the dialogue and reactions of people to these changes should be there to fully adjust to the new setting.  
| [[#Bloat149|Bloat149]].
|-
| EARLY GAME 
| The Age of Myth in world generation should be playable.  
| [[#Bloat148|Bloat148]].
|-
| HUMAN TOWN 
| You should be able to control a human town, as you control a dwarf fortress, but with changes appropriate to the new setting.  
|[[#Req469|Req469]] and [[#Bloat146|Bloat146]].
|-
| GOBLIN/KOBOLD/CAVER 
| Controlling the bad guys is an obvious extension, and you've got the whole friendly happy world waiting for your raiding parties.
| 
|-
| ELF FOREST RETREAT 
| Yes, elves for the elf people -- but thinking more general, as we list all these racial civilizations, we should think in broad terms and use the civilization definitions to allow any type of civilization to be played. Elves will provide some necessary extra elements for this process. Mixing the cliff dwelling, wilderness dwelling, town building, ethics/sphere-aligned/religious tendencies into a robust interface for civilization building is a long-term goal.  
|[[#Bloat25|Bloat25]].
|-
| MONSTER 
| Playing the dragons and other large beasts seems like another good (and fairly easy) extension. You'd have to be careful, since there aren't very many large beasts in the world and you don't want to just possess them and have them all burn out in a blaze of glory. Or maybe you do... or it could just give you new ones. You could also just occasionally have fun going out on an excursion and retiring, then play an adventurer and take a quest from a town to go and dispatch your old self.  
|[[#PowerGoal 60|PowerGoal60]].
|-
| MERCHANT 
| With the Caravan Arc, we have traders moving around the world, but I said over there that I didn't want to mess around too much with having a real economy, or it would surely fall apart and all the towns would starve. Once I get up the nerve to tackle these problems, it would be a lot of fun to play a merchant or guild yourself. You could even retire and be visited by yourself in a subsequent dwarf game.  
|[[#PowerGoal 62|PowerGoal62]].
|-
| MAGIC 
| There are no specific decisions nailed down yet, although we've thought about it a lot. It's probably best to go for a very general system here, as in the first Armok attempt. Then the world generator and entities can decide what they want to use from what's available. Early efforts might be to make dwarven artifacts more interesting and to increase the power and variability of enemy leaders, rather than focusing on traditional spell-casting adventurers.  
| [[#Bloat134|Bloat134]], [[#PowerGoal 58|PowerGoal58]], [[#PowerGoal 68|PowerGoal68]], [[#PowerGoal 84|PowerGoal84]], [[#PowerGoal 92|PowerGoal92]], [[#PowerGoal 97|PowerGoal97]], [[#PowerGoal 108|PowerGoal108]], [[#PowerGoal 122|PowerGoal122]] and [[#PowerGoal 128|PowerGoal128]].
|-
| CONTROL A WIZARD ENTITY 
| Not just one of those guys that backs up the team and shoots fireballs, but run something more like a dwarven outpost and construct your own multilevel tower or other such dwelling. This could include adventure style elements where your wizard is engaged in various activities, as well as larger scale army battles and so on. Randomized creatures could also be introduced as you create your minions, and they should be able to breed and expand outward, perhaps becoming a playable race in either adventure or civilization modes.  
| [[#Bloat134|Bloat134]], [[#Bloat147|Bloat147]], [[#PowerGoal 58|PowerGoal58]] and [[#PowerGoal 60|PowerGoal60]].
|-
| DEITY 
| Have religions in the game correspond to forces or deities and let you play one and do whatever you like, possibly restricted by your defining characteristics and geography.  
|[[#Bloat344|Bloat344]], [[#Bloat376|Bloat376]], [[#Bloat377|Bloat377]], [[#Bloat382|Bloat382]], [[#PowerGoal 64|PowerGoal64]], [[#PowerGoal 75|PowerGoal75]], [[#PowerGoal 82|PowerGoal82]], [[#PowerGoal 86|PowerGoal86]], [[#PowerGoal 90|PowerGoal90]], [[#PowerGoal 105|PowerGoal105]], [[#PowerGoal 109|PowerGoal109]], [[#PowerGoal 113|PowerGoal113]], [[#PowerGoal 118|PowerGoal118]], [[#PowerGoal 122|PowerGoal122]], [[#PowerGoal 125|PowerGoal125]], [[#PowerGoal 135|PowerGoal135]], [[#PowerGoal 139|PowerGoal139]], [[#PowerGoal 141|PowerGoal141]] and [[#PowerGoal 146|PowerGoal146]].
|-
| WORLD GENERATION PARAMETERS 
| Allow some degree of control over the world and the more sweeping aspects of play. Possibilities include control over terrain, magic, religions, random vs. stock creatures, fantasy vs. a more 'historical' (ie human) feeling. Ideally, the variability would allow you to move between standard fantasy, fairy tales, mythic fantasy and gothic fantasy, for example. If there are concepts like planes or dimensions implemented, you'd have control over that as well. You could also set the mood -- there's no reason the game needs to be violent at all, for example, assuming the rest of the game can carry it at that point. The world could be generated completely underwater or with no water at all. You could be the first or last sentient creature. There are lots of ways this could go.  
| [[#Bloat150|Bloat150]], [[#Bloat217|Bloat217]] and [[#PowerGoal 125|PowerGoal125]].
|-
| TERRAIN/WEATHER/SWIMMING/FLYING/BOATS 
| Boats of some kind might go in early to make different regions more accessible, but you won't be able to be a pirate or an undersea civ for quite a while. Rivers freeze with daily temperatures instead of seasonal temperatures. Realize river and ocean squares when you visit them (forcing town layouts to adapt). Realize interesting canyons and so on in such areas. Track hurricanes and other major storm/disasters, in-game and during world gen. Thunderstorms with lightning strikes (with corresponding lighting effects) and hail. Levels of rainfall. Eating snow, making snowballs and picking up hail during and after hail storms. Tornados with wind flows that push items, projectiles and creatures. Proper eclipse modeling. Tides, deep oceans and pearl-diving, etc. More intricate interplay between cliff faces, inner rivers and outer rivers, using Z coord and waterfalls.
|
|-
| PLANES 
| Once it's all established, you can make regions arbitrarily strange, and you make a lot of them. The real chore here is allowing multiple world maps to be active in one way or another and to allow game elements to move between them. It would be a headache to program, but it would add a lot to the game.  
|[[#PowerGoal 81|PowerGoal81]].
|-
| EDITORS 
| Draw your own region maps, create your own towns, creatures, items, start situations, etc. For example, you could create Earth at various time periods (or an amalgamation of various time periods).
|
|-
| AND MORE, AND WORSE 
| I'm still too embarrassed to share every idea we had... The Keep and Event Horizon came up. You don't want to know.

| CARAVANS
| (Future)
| Use resource tracking and the adventurer travel infrastructure to set up groups of traders that go between sites. Make sure to respect the current flow of the dwarf game, though caravans will no longer be 'generated' when needed. Related to entity knowledge transfer if we are there by this time. The trading done by caravans would interface with the resource tracking system and thus be immediately available to adventurers. This includes items traded away by your dwarf fortress, although it's possible they could be abstracted a bit if they are too numerous.

| FIRE
| Completed
| Have items catch on fire. Fire spreads. Trees outside can catch fire. Creatures catch on fire when appropriate. Items become damaged. Very hot metal objects can melt, and they can melt over characters carrying them, using the same "contaminant" system that currently handles poison injections.
| 
|-
| <div id="Core15">Core15</div>
| PRESENTATION OF ENEMY LEADERS AND OTHER IMPORTANT FIGURES
| (Future)
| Enemy leaders play an important part in creating a story around otherwise by-the-numbers conflicts that can occur, so the leaders can afford to be presented in such a way that you as the player can learn something about their background, motivations and appearance without digging around in the legends screen. There can be a variety of mechanisms for this. Diplomats and others that visit your fortress could afford the same treatment, as well as the people you talk to and about in adventure mode conversations, etc.

| TITLE MOVIES

| <div id="Core21">Core21</div>
| SOUND
| (Future)
| Make all music/sounds optional, in groups. More songs (possibly seasonal), incidental music (like spotting the first kobold in a cave, etc.), various combat type sounds and ambient sounds, pleasing interface clicks.
| 
|-
| <div id="Core22">Core22</div>
| ADVISORS
| (Future)
| Either some kind of abstract advisors, or the actual dwarves that are living there. They can look over the state of the fortress and come up with some suggestions to help you survive and advance up the noble chain.
| 
|-
| <div id="Core23">Core23</div>
| THE MANUAL
| Completed
| Do all of the sections of a basic manual to be viewed in-game.
| 
|-
| <div id="Core24">Core24</div>
| ADVENTURER PARTIES
| (Future)
| Create up to, say, 6 characters at once. These are controlled as with the dwarven raiding parties. If the scenarios are in, it can generate historical connections that explain why they are together. Could give your group a name, like the dwarf squads, and non-players could be admitted, as in the standard adventure mode 'join' option.
| [[#Core61|Core61]]
|-
| <div id="Core25">Core25</div>
| PLOT CLEANUP
| Completed
| The dwarf mode used to have some fixed plot events, like an attack by an undead army and so on. These were excised, but there's a lot of associated cleanup needed. Once this is established, the game will be ready for armies.
| 
|-
| <div id="Core26">Core26</div>
| OVERLAND ARMIES ATTACKS
| (Future)
| The invasions by various creatures should no longer generate soldiers, but should use overland armies instead. There should be some AI limits in place to stop early dwarven outposts from being overwhelmed (at least as a default).
| [[#Core25|Core25]], [[#Core45|Core45]]
|-
| <div id="Core27">Core27</div>
| ARMIES OF DWARVES
| (Future)
| You should be able to send patrols (and, as you get more dwarves, armies) out over the world map. They could attack smaller nearby threats, such as a kobold cave, or let you know about incoming invasions.
| [[#Core26|Core26]]
|-
| <div id="Core28">Core28</div>
| CONTROL OF TERRITORY AND EXTERNAL LOCATIONS
| (Future)
| As your fortress expands into a barony, county and duchy, these words should attain some meaning with regards to the surrounding lands. Additional outposts/villages/work camps might be founded under your control, but out of the playable view, providing local trade and a further population pool for warfare and other endeavors. The scope is undecided, but this might include typical mountainside outposts, dwarf/human/mixed villages nearby in other biomes, or deeper sites that you found in tunnels that you carve via the next core item.
| [[#Core29|Core29]], [[#Bloat172|Bloat172]]
|-
| <div id="Core29">Core29</div>
| EXTERNAL CONSTRUCTIONS
| (Future)
| World map roads, bridges, walls and tunnels shouldn't just be products of world generation. You should be able to dispatch dwarves and materials to accomplish these tasks (though the amount of material used in a typical world generation road would virtually prohibit doing this as it currently stands, so something has to change).
| [[#Core28|Core28]]
|-
| <div id="Core30">Core30</div>
| KINGDOM
| (Future)
| If you manage to get the monarch of the dwarves to arrive, you should obtain at least indirect control over the entire corresponding dwarven civilization. This includes the movement of all dwarven armies on the map and the ability to make the most important diplomatic decisions.
| [[#Core28|Core28]]
|-
| <div id="Core31">Core31</div>
| MAPS FOR SITES
| Completed
| Caves and goblin fortress maps.
| 
|-
| <div id="Core32">Core32</div>
| STARTING QUESTS
| Completed
| Set up asking about surroundings, basic quests and town defense.
| 
|-
| <div id="Core33">Core33</div>
| SERVING YOUR MONARCH
| (Future)
| Once you have an outside village (or even before), you could receive orders from the dwarven leader to serve up some of your population as troops. If the soldier is one of your familiar fortress units, you could control them in any future army fights later in that game, or you might control an entire squad if more of your soldiers were drafted.
| 
|-
| <div id="Core34">Core34</div>
| ABANDONMENT
| Completed
| Preserved dwarves when you abandon a game in an 'army' for later use.
| 
|-
| <div id="Core35">Core35</div>
| DWARF RAIDS
| (Future)
| If you send one of your patrols to attack a site, and it is small enough, you should be able to control the units individually, as in adventure mode. If your group is large, then you could either control one squad as a party, and have the others on AI, or you could let the whole thing run real-time as in dwarf mode.
| [[#Core27|Core27]]
|-
| <div id="Core36">Core36</div>
| BURROWS
| (Future)
| You should be able to associate buildings and dwarves to areas called burrows. A dwarf would only work on jobs at its burrow, and could not haul between burrows unless specifically designated to do so. Miners, outside workers, engravers and so on would be exempt while doing those jobs. Burrows could have general goals for the amount of objects, such as bins, that they need to have, and you could order transfers between burrows with the manager. Manager work orders could specify burrows. Once your fortress is large, having such a system to reduce the amount of hauling is very important. Coupled with some of the other ideas, large fortresses should become easier to manage.
| 
|-
| <div id="Core37">Core37</div>
| RETIREMENT
| Completed
| Add the ability to retire (or rest) your adventurer in any town.
| 
|-
| <div id="Core38">Core38</div>
| SITE RESOURCES
| (Future)
| The objects at a site need to be tracked in an abstract form so that the world can use them without loading up the site files. The different profession holders working at a town in world-gen and then during play should be able to produce and use resources based on these stockpiles and local map propertioes. Any changes could be applied to existing site files retroactively when they are loaded. Stores should restock their inventories. The objects need to be separated based on the entity that owns them, since several entities can potentially operate at one site.
| 
|-
| <div id="Core39">Core39</div>
| END GAME 3
| Completed
| Additional handling of dwarf mode end game.
| 
|-
| <div id="Core40">Core40</div>
| MONSTERS
| (Future)
| Dragon attacks need to be more righteous. Their flying needs to be more of a benefit. Snatching and dropping people should be possible. Would also be good to get the wizards and undead armies from the old fixed-plot stuff back into the mix. There was a time when the dead dwarves and pets would suddenly rise in your fortress, due to a plot event. That might have to wait for magic.
| 
|-
| <div id="Core41">Core41</div>
| TOWN, HOME AND SCHEDULES
| Completed
| People in towns should have families and they should live in locations together. People should have a rough idea of where they should be over the course of the day. The peasants should need to eat and sleep, but for now they'll be well provided for. Many of the armed people in the town should be guards that won't join you.
| 
|-
| <div id="Core42">Core42</div>
| TOWN, ITEMS
| (Future)
| Basic items all around the town, including differentiations between the homes of various people. Keys. Clothes, outfits, uniforms and symbols. Workshops/etc. in towns related to professions, trade and resources.
| 
|-
| <div id="Core43">Core43</div>
| TOWN, IMPORTANT LOCATIONS
| (Future)
| Make the important people stay in relevant locations. Make the keep in the capital more interesting. Interesting adornments. Add a bit more culture to the mead hall where the mayor and drunks stay.
| [[#Core42|Core42]]
|-
| <div id="Core44">Core44</div>
| OVERLAND TOWN MIGRANTS
| Completed
| If towns become depopulated (by an adventurer perhaps!), migrants can appear on map edges or seashores from seas adjacent to map edges. These groups can enter towns and join with existing towns (possibly at a low allegiance level). You can meet these groups in adventure mode.
| 
|-
| <div id="Core45">Core45</div>
| CIVILIZATIONS AT WAR
| (Future)
| Civilizations (for example, goblins or expansionist humans) should be able to declare war on each other and raise armies. They can send messengers to outlying towns or gather soldiers as they march from town to town toward their destinations.
| [[#Core44|Core44]]
|-
| <div id="Core46">Core46</div>
| ARMY BATTLES
| (Future)
| Hostile armies that meet each other should be able to fight and take losses. Armies should be able to attack towns, take captive historical figures, and switch towns to new allegiances over time. Does not include protracted sieges, tactics or strategy -- just the basics. An adventurer at the site of an army battle can observe it.
| [[#Core45|Core45]]
|-
| <div id="Core47">Core47</div>
| CLEANING HISTORY
| Completed
| Unimportant dead historical figures should be abstracted away to save space.
| 
|-
| <div id="Core48">Core48</div>
| SEAMLESS MAP
| Completed
| The adventurer should be able to move between areas of the map from the local view without having to leave from an edge. Current sites should respect this.
| 
|-
| <div id="Core49">Core49</div>
| FULL Z AXIS
| Completed
| The Z-axis should be supported in dwarf mode and elevations should be respected in adventure mode.
| 
|-
| <div id="Core50">Core50</div>
| TILESET SUPPORT
| (Future)
| Allow graphical tiles to be used for all game objects.
| 
|-
| <div id="Core51">Core51</div>
| SIZEABLE GAME WINDOW
| (Future)
| Allow the resizing of the game windows, and possibly the support of variable width fonts to allow more text to be displayed.
| 
|-
| <div id="Core52">Core52</div>
| INTERFACE OVERHAUL
| (Future)
| A coherent interface, additional options and mouse support.
| 
|-
| <div id="Core53">Core53</div>
| MORE RAW FILES
| (Future)
| Everything should be moved out of the code and into the raw folders, insofar as the processor will allow it. There needs to be a generalized framework for things like plant and animal related materials and products. Not all of the building types will make it out, but workshop and furnace types are certainly good candidates.
| 
|-
| <div id="Core54">Core54</div>
| TRANSLATION SUPPORT
| (Future)
| Announcements and other interface text needs to come out of the game and be placed in an editable format to support any potential translators, though current font implementations restrict this process at the moment if non-ASCII characters are to be involved.
| 
|-
| <div id="Core55">Core55</div>
| LIGHTING
| (Future)
| This is essentially the old lighting dev item, upgraded, since it's important that proper lighting, vision, torches, etc. are recognized. The most necessary parts are making vision depending on the lighting of the location in question rather than where you are standing and adding some means of producing light (torches, candles, etc).

| IMPROVED FORTRESS TRANSPORTATION
| (Future)
| Though there's always going to be room for improvement here, some basics are needed the first version. Work animals, carts or wheelbarrows, perhaps some more mechanical options, and the ability to organize stockpiles, workshops and other elements of the fortress so that transport of items can be done with less pain.
| 
|-
| <div id="Core57">Core57</div>
| IMPROVED FORTRESS AUTOMATION AND WORKSHOP HANDLING
| (Future)
| As with transportation, the goal itself is pretty open-ended, but certain basics goals need to be reached for v1. Ability to use specific materials more easily, job priorities, better automatic job creation via manager triggers etc., and whatever else is deemed essential.
| 
|-
| <div id="Core58">Core58</div>
| DOCUMENTATION
| (Future)
| The in-game documentation is dire -- not quite like the Dire Wolf of the Pleistocene, but more like a "dire economic forecast". Any of manual improvements, context-based help with the mouse, or an in-game encyclopedia might make the game more accessible, along with tutorials and more graphical options.
| 
|-
| <div id="Core59">Core59</div>
| LOVE AND ROMANCE
| (Future)
| Though some of the dialog is likely to be an entertaining trainwreck, especially if coupled with a random poem generator (yes, that's a threat), love of all sorts is very important for driving stories and situations and needs to come in all over the place -- world generation, the world during play, dwarf mode and adventure mode.
| 
|-
| <div id="Core60">Core60</div>
| HEIRS
| (Future)
| Having playable heirs in adventure mode would be fun. Dwarves should also do a bit more for their children than sometimes running to pick them up when they are crawling toward the magma vent as infants, and the notion of the family in general could afford to have more impact on the game.
| 
|-
| <div id="Core61">Core61</div>
| ADVENTURER ENTITIES
| (Future)
| Your adventuring group deserves entity status, as it's quite possibly one of the most important groups in all of history. This will activate all of the entity vs. entity and individual vs. entity mechanics in the game and allow you to establish your place in the world as army/entity changes allow you to delegate orders to subordinates and so on. It would be possible for the group to persist between games and adventurers, perhaps even harassing a new fortress when bandits are put in.
| [[#Core24|Core24]]
|-
| <div id="Core62">Core62</div>
| FURTHER DIPLOMACY
| (Future)
| Diplomacy in dwarf mode could afford a lot of changes. Aside from trade agreements that are more interesting, fun to uphold and related to the state of the world, all sorts of relationships could be established with both neighboring civilizations and the parent civilization. Though we'll leave quite a bit of work for later versions, the system should be satisfying for version 1 as it merges with the caravan arc, wars, tribute and succession conflicts described in other v1 dev items.
| 
|-
| <div id="Core63">Core63</div>
| SUCCESSION, ASSOCIATED CONFLICTS AND SCHISMS
| (Future)
| First of all, succession for positions needs to occur in play, so that dead liaisons are replaced, as well as dead monarchs. Then the process needs to be made messier all around. Wars over succession, schisms over religious disagreements, etc., starting from world gen and coming into regular play. In dwarf mode, you might be involved on one side or the other, directly or indirectly, relying on more involved diplomacy and army code than we currently have, and adventure mode can also gain a lot from such conflicts.
| 
|-
| <div id="Core64">Core64</div>
| INDIVIDUAL AFFILIATIONS
| (Future)
| People in towns should be more distinct, and almost all of them should have goals that the player can help them out with. These might be based on likes and dislikes, relationships with other people in town or farther away, etc., and though they'll start in world gen it's imperative that new goals, etc. be formed as well, especially as the Life Cycles Arc comes in. Individual goals are vital to break up the AI brain-death caused by homogeneous entity affiliations and to create tension within entities that can serve to spontaneously create complicated situations. These provide useful material for adventure mode (possibly the bulk of it), and any changes beyond what already exists in dwarf mode can be adopted for your dwarves as well.
| 
|-
| <div id="Core65">Core65</div>
| ADVENTURER SITE AFFILIATIONS
| (Future)
| When you perform a task for an entity, you currently can an affiliation with it, but that's all. This needs to be expanded greatly. Not only should you be given various positions of responsibility, but you should also become accepted by the group in question and given some way of obtaining living space, equipment, pay, etc. as appropriate. It would also be good for tasks to be appropriate for the goals of the entity, and where possible, to soften the notion of a task -- if you do something that benefits a group, even if the group didn't explicitly ask for it, this should raise your standing with them in general (to the extent that the action/benefit is detectable from a technical standpoint), and a person at an appropriate position within a group should in some circumstances be able to act under their own power with entity subordinates. The primary target entities/positions here for version 1 are soldiers (either proper ones or loosely defined mead hall groups), caravan guards, bandits and religious groups.

| HIDDEN FUN STUFF
| (Future)
| No game is complete without it!
| 
|-
| <div id="Core67">Core67</div>
| RUINS
| (Future)
| There used to be ruins with skeletons and zombies with architecture not found elsewhere in the world. This can be recovered in various ways, the most prominent of which is just having civilizations with different architectures bury their dead and those they die out can have proper ruins. Lost and buried ruins, as in those found at dig sites, are possible with some work. Whether or not the dead rise or there are just traps or nothing at all can also depend on all sorts of things, mainly the civilization in question and what happened to ruin it in the first place.
| [[#Core68|Core68]]
|-
| <div id="Core68">Core68</div>
| GRAVEYARDS AND TOMBS
| (Future)
| Right now the dead are so dead they don't exist outside of the fantastic memories of the people that have heard of them. There should be various methods of disposal, some adventure-full ones being graveyards and tombs, including large and elaborate tombs with all sorts of treasure and traps appropriate for the civilization that created them.
| [[#Core67|Core67]]
|-
| <div id="Core69">Core69</div>
| OLD BATTLEFIELDS
| (Future)
| Battlefields are currently referenced by their general coordinates on the world map during legends, but they don't actually exist as places. Though not all battles would leave traces, especially after a long time has passed, others would, and since this is a fantasy game, it's important to take this in various directions. The first target would be world gen battlefields, but battlefields that occur once armies are fighting need to be handled as well, whether you are present as an adventurer or dwarven army or not.
| 
|-
| <div id="Core70">Core70</div>
| FORTRESS RUINS, PRODUCTION TRACKING AND HISTORY TRIGGERS
| (Future)
| Right now, an abandoned fortress is basically a scattered mass of crap. If any item is moved, there should at least be a plausible reason for it to happen. Additionally, since tracking too many items in fortress mode can lead to problems, one early idea was to add additional items after abandonment that would flesh out the fortress, such as production logs and diaries. These would have to be squared with reclaim, however. Depending on how that works out, the items themselves might occur during standard play instead or not at all. In any case, various facts about production and prominent (and other) artisans need to be tracked and available after sufficient poking around (or earlier should the parameters call for it, as with historical events).
| 
|-
| <div id="Core71">Core71</div>
| BANDITS AND CULTS
| (Future)
| It's important to have groups acting on their own or generally causing trouble without necessarily belonging to an entirely different civilization. Bandits and cults are good choices to start. Bandits could harass or make demands of an early fortress, cults could spring up in a later one, and the adventurer could end up a member or an adversary.
| 
|-
| <div id="Core72">Core72</div>
| ROBUST ATTRIBUTE SYSTEM
| (Future)
| Attributes are a sad, sad placeholder right now. There should be more attributes, say those from Armok 1, and their development, to the extent that they change, should depend on use rather than random assignment. They should degrade slowly over time if left completely unused.
| 
|-
| <div id="Core73">Core73</div>
| COMBAT OVERHAUL
| (Future)
| This one is a bit vague, mostly because the Combat Arc consists of so many small changes rather than a few sweeping additions. Aside from obvious changes to projectiles and the wrestling interface, skills could afford to overlap, attributes need to be associated to skills properly, skills could become rusty and ultimately degrade as in Armok 1, new general combat related skills can be added, styles/techniques for weapon/weaponless fighting roughly along the path Armok 1 had started, etc. As a dev item, this'll be done when combat more or less makes sense.
| 
|-
| <div id="Core74">Core74</div>
| WOUND HANDLING
| (Future)
| Wounds are dull right now and lead to at least one major problem (extreme and long-lasting phantom limb pain). Proper descriptions, scarring, infections and so on are in order here.
| 
|-
| <div id="Core75">Core75</div>
| ADVENTURER GENERATION AND SCENARIOS
| (Future)
| The adventurer is quite a nebulous object at this point. There are a variety of angles that can be taken here, from weaving the adventurer fully into their starting location's history, actually playing an existing creature in the world, creating starting scenarios that at least make sense of the adventurer's existence and/or mysterious arrival, etc.
| 
|-
| <div id="Core76">Core76</div>
| EMBARK SCENARIOS
| (Future)
| Embarking in dwarf mode is one of the more sterile, gameish parts of the... game, and it can afford to be spruced up. Though a full take-your-wagons-from-here-to-there style embark is probably beyond the scope of version 1, at least giving the backstory for the journey and adding various game effects and alterations to starting conditions based on it would help with immersion.
| 
|-
| <div id="Core77">Core77</div>
| AGE AND POPULATION TRACKING FOR ENTITIES
| (Future)
| Once world gen terminates, age-related deaths only occur locally and people never have children again. This needs to be corrected, especially as armies and migrants start being pulled from actual populations rather than being generated on the spot.
| 
|-
| <div id="Core78">Core78</div>
| WILDERNESS POPULATION TRACKING
| (Future)
| Wilderness population is quite limited, and worse in a few ways than it was back before the Z coordinate. This should be fixed in world gen and in regular play in all modes for all categories of wilderness or subterranean creature.
| 
|-
| <div id="Core79">Core79</div>
| COLLECTORS AND FINDING BUYERS
| (Future)
| As an extension of the dwarf mode system of likes and dislikes, you should be able to find people that are collecting objects, starting with simple objects like coins and bugs. It should also be an adventure unto itself to find a buyer for many valuable objects, if you want to get more than a local merchant would be able to provide, and news of your acquisition should keep your life interesting.
| 
|-
| <div id="Core80">Core80</div>
| ARTIFACT MAGIC
| (Future)
| An early angle on magic that should find its way into the game. Although ultimately influenced by world parameters, stock DF will likely focus on rare, unique, somewhat mysterious effects without tables, to the extent that that's possible. Some cliches are probably unavoidable, he he he. The artifact process is likely to be changed somewhat to align with this, and artifacts should be created in world-generation and elsewhere during play, though a good player artifact should still have high importance.
| 
|-
| <div id="Core81">Core81</div>
| TRIBUTE
| (Future)
| The tribute relationships established during world generation should be fleshed out there and then brought into regular play with tribute being transported across the map. These could also occur as part of dwarf mode diplomacy and dwarf mode world map play.
| 
|-
| <div id="Core82">Core82</div>
| THIEF AND SUPPORTING CAST
| (Future)
| Aside from the issues dealt with in the next dev item, a thief in adventure mode can only sell their items all the way over at the next civilization and is immediately considered a criminal throughout the original civilization, causing subsequent thefts there to be more the acts of a crazed bandit than a thief. There are lots of ways in which this should be fixed. Crimes should not immediately be tied to the adventurer, and in large enough cities, there should be enough of an underbelly to be a successful criminal without even leaving town, at least for a while. None of the existing cities are really large enough for this right now, though the most populous cities of large empires should be after the relevant dev items are complete. Whether general criminal behavior will be extended to dwarf mode, beyond what's there now, is an open question.
| 
|-
| <div id="Core83">Core83</div>
| ARREST AND PUNISHMENT
| (Future)
| The guards shouldn't just kill you. You have rights, sort of. It's important that there are jails and dungeons and executions, anyway. The guards will need to arrest you to put you into the system, and once you've been arrested there are various delicate steps that need to be performed properly for everything to work out. Whatever happens in adventure mode should be tied back in to dwarf mode. If this includes beard-shaving, well, you'd better just obey the law.
| 
|-
| <div id="Core84">Core84</div>
| HUNTING AND GATHERING
| (Future)
| You need to be able to obtain food from the wilderness and perform other tasks related to processing a hunted creature's body, trading with a town perhaps but able to survive in the wilds. More abstract hunting on the travel view needs to be roughly equivalent to hunting only on the local view. You should be able to find signs of animals to help you out, and you should be able to gather any plants you find.
| 
|-
| <div id="Core85">Core85</div>
| CHOP, DIG, BUILD!
| (Future)
| As an adventurer, chop down trees, dig channels, mine into a cliff face, build whatever structure you have the patience for. Your efforts should be saved as a proper site or at least some similar notion (whatever inns and so on along roads end up using), and the contents should remain relatively undisturbed with proper precautions.
| 
|-
| <div id="Core86">Core86</div>
| ADVANCED ADVENTURER SKILLS
| (Future)
| Virtually every job available in dwarf mode should be available to you as an adventurer, though it might rely on town infrastructure, especially at first.
| 
|-
| <div id="Core87">Core87</div>
| PROPER DWARVES
| (Future)
| Dwarves are, of course, proper when they are played in dwarf mode, but their sites in adventure mode are completely lacking and their society isn't really realized anywhere outside of dwarf mode play. They need to be brought up to standards throughout the world and in adventure mode. Also note, for this and the following three core items, there will be some emphasis not on just building up the stock universe, but extending modding/random possibilities for all civilizations by providing these as fleshed-out and somewhat diverse examples.
| 
|-
| <div id="Core88">Core88</div>
| PROPER ELVES
| (Future)
| As with the dwarves, the current elves, especially their sites, suffer from a lack of almost everything. Multi-tile trees, how the druids and the regional forces interact, their relationship with animals and the animal peoples, their dining habits in-game rather than just in world generation...
| 
|-
| <div id="Core89">Core89</div>
| PROPER GOBLINS
| (Future)
| At the very least, the role of baby-snatching needs to be further sorted, and their demonic leaders should have proper world-spanning aspirations. Many of the elements of their might-makes-right ethical framework need to be fleshed out and used in actual play.
| 
|-
| <div id="Core90">Core90</div>
| PROPER KOBOLDS
| (Future)
| Of course, this means different things to different people. To us, a proper kobold is neither a chihuahua man nor a mini-draconian, but instead sort of a small mammaloreptilian humanoid with pointy ears and yellow eyes with a penchant for trickery and mischief, context-based sublanguage, poisonous critter collection, traps and kleptomaniacal hoarding.
| 
|-
| <div id="Core91">Core91</div>
| PROPER UNDERGROUND/MAP FEATURES
| (Future)
| Underground is currently where the stone and boring stuff and occasionally something else is. There needs to be more something else and less boring and stone, though stone might be bored. This project includes areas outside the mountains, as well as some interesting natural features in the mostly featureless above ground areas.
| 
|-
| <div id="Core92">Core92</div>
| APPEARANCE VARIABLES/DESCRIPTIONS

| This is especially relevant for individualizing civilized critters you meet, but important elsewhere as well, and will be the springboard for randomly-generated beasties and other stuffs.
| 
|-
| <div id="Core93">Core93</div>
| RANDOMIZED MEGABEASTS AND POWERS
| (Future)
| (Semi)megabeasts and powers can be randomly generated, in accordance with existing local belief structures or regional sphere alignments when that goes in. The degree of randomization should depend on world parameters so that stock creatures can still be used.
| [[#Core92|Core92]]
|-
| <div id="Core94">Core94</div>
| RANDOMIZED REGIONS AND THEIR FLORA/FAUNA
| (Future)
| The current good/evil regions should be scrapped and replaced by a system that aligns a region to varying degrees with a set of spheres. In this way you could end up with a desert where the stones sing or a forest where the trees bleed, with all sorts of randomly generated creatures and plants that are appropriate to the sphere settings. It's important that randomly generated objects be introduced to the player carefully during play rather than just being thrown one after another to allow for immersion, though there's also something to be said for cold dumping the player in a world with completely random settings, provided they can access enough information by looking/listening and having conversations, etc.
| [[#Core92|Core92]]
|-
| <div id="Core95">Core95</div>
| RANDOMIZED ENTITIES AND CIVILIZED CREATURES
| (Future)
| As a further project of random generation, an entire entity definition complete with creature definitions, items, etc. could be generated and introduced into the world. As with other random settings, the degree to which this process is used would depend on world generation parameters, and the generation procedures would be accessible through raw objects.
| [[#Core93|Core93]], [[#Core94|Core94]]
|-
| <div id="Core96">Core96</div>
| GENERALIZED CURSES AND OTHER ALTERATIONS
| (Future)
| "Zombie" and "Skeleton" modified creatures aren't really satisfying right now, since zombies, ghosts, and so on gain some of their interest from the details surrounding the transformation and the particulars of the creature so transformed. Generalized curses and sphere-based alterations could vary from world to world and involve all sorts of changes to creatures (and other objects).

Can try to make sunlight shine inside caves a bit by casting light lines on map-gen. Can track light with RGB filters so that things through red gem windows look red, etc. Things seen through glass statues could be distorted from their proper positions. Once fire is in, can do torches and other such light sources. Dwarves could place fires or gem lamps in dark places. Any magical take on alchemy could make extensive use of gems in this fashion, and the different colors of light can please certain nobles etc. Related to Core55.

| Inventory like gloves, rings etc. do not respect severs. For now, gloves can fall off when both hands are gone. Whether or not to add left/right gloves later is an open question. It would be realistic, but it would also bog-down dwarf mode. However, being able to mix and match gloves etc. would lead to many interesting situations and possible enhancements.

Ghosts can show you their bodies. Ghosts can pretend to do their old jobs. Ghost appearance can depend on how they died. Could force the adventurer to interact with ghosts to access now-secret parts of the fortress (could also use writings and legends for this). It can keep outposts that it normally throws away for fun little ghost stories. If the dwarves hate the elves, the ghosts could guide the adventurer to a poisoned goblet or insultingly engraved object to bring back to the elves, and they could lie to the player about it.

| The boundary between the glacier and ocean biomes probably shouldn't be a regular beach in virtually all cases.
| 
|-
| <div id="Bloat366">Bloat366</div>
| SMOOTHER ELEVATION CHANGES
| (Future)
| The game relies on cliffs too much to handle midmap elevation changes, especially in river valleys.
| 
|-
| <div id="Bloat367">Bloat367</div>
| WATER ON BUILDINGS DISPLAY
| (Future)
| Water running over buildings currently blots them out. You should probably be able to see what's there -- grates and bars at the very least.
| 
|-
| <div id="Bloat368">Bloat368</div>
| GENDER-BASED PICTURES
| (Future)
| You should be able to further specify which graphical tiles are used if you like.
| 
|-
| <div id="Bloat369">Bloat369</div>
| LEGENDARY SWIM SPEED
| (Future)
| It could afford to make finer gradations for swim skill passed legendary.
| 
|-
| <div id="Bloat370">Bloat370</div>
| ITEMS AND GRATES/BARS
| (Future)
| Small items should have a chance of falling through floor grates. Floor bars should be even worse. Projectiles should also interact with grates and bars (similar to fortifications).
| 
|-
| <div id="Bloat371">Bloat371</div>
| SUBORDINATE SITE POPULATIONS
| (Future)
| A site that becomes subordinated under a dwarf site should still be able to maintain its inhabitants after the dwarf game.
| 
|-
| <div id="Bloat372">Bloat372</div>
| MORE WITH TRAPS
| (Future)
| Traps, being far too powerful, should probably have to be set up. For instance, you should be required to actually create a stonefall trap using a few different locations to get it to work. Pulling things apart like this will also allow more versatility.
| 
|-
| <div id="Bloat373">Bloat373</div>
| IMPROVED DRUNKS
| (Future)
| Adventure mode drunks shouldn't be a separate unit type. They are currently determined by the immoderation personality facet, but much more can be done here. In general, there's an implication that world gen personalities should be stored for more units, but that is expensive memory-wise.
| 
|-
| <div id="Bloat374">Bloat374</div>
| CONVERSATION SKILLS IN ADVENTURE MODE
| (Future)
| With the proper skills, you should be able to judge the mood of people you are talking to in finer and finer degrees. You should also be able to exercise the various conversation skills that can be used in dwarf mode.
| 
|-
| <div id="Bloat375">Bloat375</div>
| PRIVACY AND ADVENTURE MODE CONVERSATIONS

|-
| <div id="Bloat376">Bloat376</div>
| TALKING TO GODS
| (Future)
| Instead of being forced to join a temple first, a player should be able to attempt to speak to any known deity.
| 
|-
| <div id="Bloat377">Bloat377</div>
| TEMPLE-SPECIFIC TASKS
| (Future)
| High priests at the temple should have various things for you to do. Though it's best to have all task assignments occur within a general framework according to the goals of the task-giver, just being the leader of the temple and a strident believer in a deity will no doubt give rise to interesting and specific quests. Building a new temple and spreading the faith? Recovering holy relics? Dealing with rivals? Objectives could be vague to remove some of the quest straitjacket effect that can develop, as long as it has means to track your progress and you have various means to accomplish the task at hand. It would be cool to be accepted as a temple higher-up once you manager to spread the faith into an outlying village.
| 
|-
| <div id="Bloat378">Bloat378</div>
| MORE BUILDING CONVERSATION
| (Future)
| Right now, you only hear architecture comments when there's a direct relationship between the building and a deity, and those relationships are fairly rare. It could talk about the architect, the central figure around which the building was designed, any of the elements used in the architecture, the material used and its relationship any underlying concepts, etc.
| 
|-
| <div id="Bloat379">Bloat379</div>
| LEGEND SUBSET SELECTION
| (Future)
| The legends screen is virtually useless once enough objects and events have been discovered. You should be able to select subsets in various ways, whether by creature type or building type or time period or event type or even using a map to go by geographic area.
| 
|-
| <div id="Bloat380">Bloat380</div>
| MOODS AND IMPRESSIONS
| (Future)
| In both modes, relationships need to be stored with some more information. People should have short and long-term impressions of the people that they meet, at least as many as it can safely store (and always with the player). They can also have short and long-term moods that are altered by their interactions with others.
| 
|-
| <div id="Bloat381">Bloat381</div>
| GENERALIZE ARCHITECTURE SYSTEM
| (Future)
| The system used for temples linking abstract concepts to architectural elements should be put in to place for other structures, especially castles and towers.
| 
|-
| <div id="Bloat382">Bloat382</div>
| MORE SPHERE LINKS FOR TEMPLES
| (Future)
| Right now, only certain deity spheres get architecture links in their corresponding temples. There's more that can be done there, and the concept can be expanded from architecture to many other elements of the faith/temple, so that certain type of items/creatures/festivals/rituals/etc. occur in the temple.
| 
|-
| <div id="Bloat383">Bloat383</div>
| GOBLIN DUNGEONS
| (Future)
| The goblins lost the tunnel network under their towers with the building revision, and they want it back in improved form with various untoward goings on.
