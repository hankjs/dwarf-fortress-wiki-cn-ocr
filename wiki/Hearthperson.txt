A '''hearthperson''' is a [[soldier]] that has pledged allegiance to a [[Quest#Commander|local ruler]]. In [[Adventure mode]], you can be a hearthperson, or invite people to be your hearthpersons. Various entity types have their own terms for this position or equivalents to it: '''hearthperson''' for [[human]] civilizations, '''fortress guard''' for [[dwarven]] civilizations, '''soldier''' for the governments of occupied sites<!-- Not for dwarven civs as they have a fixed occupied site ruler position with no underlings. -->, and '''lieutenant''' for [[boss|criminal organisations]]<!-- These are hardcoded, appearing in the string dump, but not in the raws. -->.

== Becoming a hearthperson ==
In adventure mode, you may either start the game as a newly-minted hearthperson, or become one by simply talking to a local [[noble]] and asking to become one. If you have sufficient [[fame]], they will accept the request. Which noble you need to talk to varies for the different civilizations; lord/lady for humans, [[captain of the guard]] for dwarves, etc. Most smaller sites, like hillocks, will not have such leaders.

Being a hearthperson has a number of effects, the most notable one being that you may request any number of [[quest]]s from your leader, allowing you to easily build up [[reputation]] in that leader's [[site]]. In addition to the normal reputation you'd gain as a [[bandit]] or beast slayer, you will also build up the reputation of a loyal soldier to your superior. Being a hearthperson also means your loyalty lies with that of your leader, i.e. any [[insurrections]] against them are also against ''you'', since you are effectively one of the leader's guards.

== Acquiring hearthpersons ==
You may have hearthpersons yourself by becoming a leader by [[claim]]ing a [[site]] with no conflicting dispute{{verify|heard reports of being able to recruit even with disputes}}. Killing everyone linked to a civilized site before claiming it might work, but isn't usually doable except for the smaller ones. Once you are awarded the title of "lord", "lady", or similar{{verify|isn't lord/lady only the term for humans?}}, you may then start hiring guards by inviting them to become hearthpersons. Note that your hearthpersons are not your companions unless they already were.
