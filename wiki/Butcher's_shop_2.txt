The '''butcher's shop''' is used to [[Butcher#Slaughtering|slaughter]] [[Tame animals|tame animals]], or to [[butcher]] the corpses or skeletons of slain wild animals.  A tame animal can be designated for slaughter in the {{k|u}} [[Unit_list|Creatures]] menu under the Pets/Livestock tab.

Slaughtering is instantaneous once the animal has been led to the butcher's shop.  [[Pet]]s cannot be slaughtered.

Wild animal corpses, body parts or skeletons can be [[Butcher#Butchering|butchered]] as long as they are sufficiently close to the butcher's shop, and sufficiently large to yield results.  Butchering is ''not'' instanteous.

== Industry ==
A butchered animal results into various items with different uses:

== Tasks ==

*'''Butcher an animal'''
Renders a dead animal into its component parts of [[meat]], [[fat]], [[skin]], [[bone]]s, and [[skull]]s. Usually used on animals that your [[hunter]] brings back, or tame animals you chose for slaughter. The animal must be in a stockpile (anywhere) or lying on the ground within 20 tiles of the edge of the butcher's shop ''in the same z-level'' (i.e. a 43×43×1 box centered on the workshop).

*'''Catch live land animal'''
Requires an [[animal trap]] and [[trapping]].
The trapper will take the trap and chase [[vermin]] until it catches one.
This task is also available in the [[vermin catcher's shop]].

*'''Extract from land animal'''
Requires a caged [[fire snake]], [[cave spider]], or [[phantom spider]] and [[Animal dissector|animal dissection]]. Contrary to the name of the task, the vermin must be alive (though it will be dead once the task is done).
Produces [[liquid fire]] and [[venom]], respectively.

== Common uses ==
*Produce meat for food.
*Produce skin for leather.
*Produce bones for bolts or bone crafts.

== Helpful strategies ==

=== Hauling and stockpile considerations ===

One thing to beware of is that butchered creatures will practically explode into piles of meat, bones, fat, organs and more; this can quickly clutter up a butchers shop or risk rotting the entire pile if not enough haulers and a suitable stockpile are available. Refuse also can not be stored in containers, so every item will use up one stockpile tile. For any jobs, such as cooking meat, rendering fat, and carving bones, the entire stack will become tasked and unavailable to other workshops.

The initial corpse or body part must be in a stockpile close enough to the butcher's shop to automatically trigger the '''Butcher a dead animal''' job.  Similarly, there is a maximum distance for the [[Main:Tanner's shop|Tanner's shop]] to notice a skin and automatically trigger a '''Tan a skin''' job.

=== Clutter reduction and rotting prevention ===

A good way to cut down on clutter and to prevent your butchered animals from rotting is to build a [[Quantum stockpile]] right next to your butcher shops and then place a stockpile at the bottom. This way, as meat is produced you can order it dumped into the stockpile so it is stored easily and will not rot.
To prevent rotten meat from producing [[miasma]], channel out a shaft above your butcher shops and build a wall around it on the surface. This way if meat rots it will not produce miasma.

== Notes ==
*The name of this workshop will change if your fortress's primary race provides a custom value for the {{token|PROFESSION_NAME|c|BUTCHER}} token.
*A butcher's shop is operated by any dwarf with the 'butchery' [[labor]].
*Corpses left to rot will become skeletons. Only those of wild animals (typically killed from hunting or traps) can be processed at the butcher's shop. Products will be bone, skull, hoof, horn and the like (no meat, fat, prepared organs or skin).
*Partial corpses as well as mutilated corpses do not provide the "full set"; the number of bones may be lower, organs may be missing.
*You can't butcher vermin fish, that is done at the [[Main:Fishery|Fishery]]. However, you can butcher underwater creatures; for instance, you can butcher 'Carp corpse', but you can't butcher 'Oyster'.
*Tame animals that die by any reason, be it [[starvation]], old [[age]], or violence, are unbutcherable. {{bug|1275}}
