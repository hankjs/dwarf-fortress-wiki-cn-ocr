[[File:ballista_arrow_preview.png|right]]'''Ballista arrows''' are, essentially, giant [[arrow]]s, created at a [[siege workshop]] and used as ammunition by a [[ballista]]. There are two types: 
* Simple wooden ballista arrows, which are "assembled" from one unit of [[wood]] at the siege workshop by a [[siege engineer]], 
* And much stronger metal ones, which first requires the creation of a ballista arrowhead at a [[metalsmith's forge]] from three units of [[metal]] bars by a [[weaponsmith]], and then final assembly with [[wood]] at the siege workshop by a [[siege engineer]]. 

For wooden arrows, the type of [[wood]] that is used impacts its strength, where heavier types of wood such as [[glumprong]] or [[blood thorn]] are better; for metal arrows, the type of wood used for the shaft is irrelevant because the game treats the entire arrow as being made of metal.  Both ballista arrowheads and the completed ballista arrows are stored in the Siege ammo section of Furniture/Siege Ammo stockpiles.

For such a big, cumbersome, inaccurate weapon, wooden ballista arrows are surprisingly ineffective, dealing only comparatively minor amounts of blunt damage. Metal ballista arrows, on the other hand, are extremely lethal, and can kill two fully-grown [[elephant]]s standing in a line if the arrow hits squarely; any [[goblin]]s you hit will be smeared all over the space on which they stood.

Creating arrowheads is tedious and resource-consuming, and both [[catapult]]s and [[ballista]]s train the [[siege operator]] skill, at the same rate, when used. Since [[catapult]]s use [[stone]]s you can literally pick up off of the ground, they're a much better practice platform for your operator, whereas a ballista armed with ''metal'' arrows is a much stronger actual weapons platform. As such, there's never much reason to produce wooden ballista arrows.
