'''Reindeer''' are very versatile [[domestic animal]]s, providing not only a respectable amount of [[meat]], but also [[horn]]s and hooves that can be used for crafting. They also produce [[milk]], which can be cooked directly or used to make [[cheese]]. While reindeer require a [[pasture]] to survive, they need less grass than most other large herbivores, making them a great choice for the food industry. They may be brought on [[embark]] or found in wild populations in [[taiga]]s and [[tundra]]s.

Some dwarves [[Preferences|like]] reindeer for their ''large herds''.

<!--Reference: "Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer" titular character of children's book-->
It has been rumored that some reindeer are generated with red noses. It has yet to be tested if this is somehow related to [[Goblin Christmas]]. It has also been rumoured that due to the relation of these rare specimens to fat [[humans]] and [[elves]], the red-nosed sub-species has been systematically killed off by the dwarves.
