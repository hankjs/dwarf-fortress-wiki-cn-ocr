[[File:Silk_preview.png|right]]'''Silk''' [[cloth]] is made from silk [[thread]]. Silk [[thread]] can be gathered from the [[web]]s of [[brown recluse spider]]s, [[brown recluse spider man|brown recluse spider men]], [[cave spider]]s, [[giant cave spider]]s, and [[phantom spider]]s (as well as any web-spinning [[forgotten beast]]s, [[titan]]s, or [[demon|Hidden Fun Stuff]]), which is then woven into cloth at a [[loom]]. Webs are automatically collected by any worker who has the [[weaver|weaving]] labor activated and access to a [[loom]], which automatically produces the work task "collect webs" and turns collected [[web]]s directly into silk thread. No [[stockpile]] is necessary for this collection.

Automatic collection of webs can be disabled from the [[Standing orders|orders menu]] (Accessed through the Labor Menu {{Menu icon|y}}) - this is useful if the accessible [[web]]s are located in a dangerous area or if you want to temporarily free up your [[weaver]]s for other tasks.

Silk was once prized as a superior choice for clothing since it was surprisingly protective for a non-[[metal]] material; this is no longer true. <!-- silk was nerfed in 31.06, along with (incidentally?) adamantine cloth --> It's still better than [[plant fiber]] as the latter is more than thrice as [[density|heavy]], and it is marginally stronger.  All kinds of silk have the same performance; the only advantage of Giant Cave Spider silk is its higher value multiplier.
