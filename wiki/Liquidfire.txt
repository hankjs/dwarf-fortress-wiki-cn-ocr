'''Liquid fire''' is an extract derived from [[fire snake]]s at a [[butcher's shop]] by a [[dwarf]] with the [[animal dissector]] [[labor]] enabled. It has no known use except as a [[trade]] good. 1 fire snake will yield 5 units of liquid, worth 100☼ each, for a total of 500☼ per [[vial]]. Extraction kills the fire snake.
