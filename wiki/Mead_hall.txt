[[File:Midgard vikingsenter (Viking Age centre) Borre Horten Norway GILDEHALLEN (reconstructed Viking inspired wooden banquet party hall 2013) Interiør (interior) festsal stolper bord benker malt treskurd vikingstil skjold.jpg|thumb|230px|Viking-age-styled mead hall.]]A '''mead hall''' is a [[structure]] built by [[human]]s, serving as the seat of the local government for a [[hamlet]]. Mead halls are located separately from houses and may even be located outside the borders. On the fast travel screen, their names will be displayed in light magenta ({{DFtext|example|5:1}}), and on the map will resemble a 3x3 block of housing with yellow roads, but unlike houses, the entire area can be traveled through. An especially young site may not yet have a mead hall constructed. When a hamlet transitions into a [[town]], the mead hall will be replaced with a [[keep]].

The stone building itself consists of one or more floors divided into rooms, with the entryway being the [[throne|throne room]] of the local lord or lady. As with keeps, various rooms will have assorted items and equipment laying around for any adventurer to take. The local ruler and his/her retainers reside in these buildings. Mead halls also tend to be much more expansive than the building within a keep, but they also lack any fortified walls with towers surrounding it.

When creating an adventurer, choosing to start as a [[hearthperson]] in a hamlet will start you off as a member of the local mead hall's soldiers.

Sadly, unlike the [[wikipedia:Mead hall|real-life inspiration for the structure]], there aren't any [[dining room]]s in which to drink [[mead]].
