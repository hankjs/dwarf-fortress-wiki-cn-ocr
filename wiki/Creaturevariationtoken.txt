Creature variations are templates for creatures. In conjunction with {{token|COPY_TAGS_FROM|c}} they may be used to create [[animal person|creatures which are derived]] [[giant animal|from another already-existing creature]], thus the name, though their use-case is broader than that, in vanilla also covering [[gait]]s and [[Creature_token#ATTACK|attacks]]. They may either be embedded inside creatures (when using {{token|APPLY_CURRENT_CREATURE_VARIATION|c}}) or be defined as CREATURE_VARIATION objects. The default variations are defined in c_variation_default.txt

Creature variations can be contrasted with the other types of templates for creatures: [[Tissue_definition_token|tissue templates]], [[Material_definition_token|material templates]], and [[body_detail_plan_token|body detail plans]]. Creature variations are the newest of the four ([https://www.bay12games.com/dwarves/dev_2009.html#2009-12-15 from 2009]) and also the most advanced.

Creature variations can add/convert almost all tokens, but {{token|APPLY_CREATURE_VARIATION|c}} is an exception, so you can’t nest creature variations.

|-
| {{text anchor|CV_NEW_TAG}}
|
*token (including token arguments)
| Adds the given token to the target creature. E.g. [CV_NEW_TAG:BIOME:ANY_FOREST] gives the creature [BIOME:ANY_FOREST].

|-
| {{text anchor|CV_ADD_TAG}}
|
*token (including token arguments)
| Alias for CV_NEW_TAG.

|-
| {{text anchor|CV_REMOVE_TAG}}
|
*leading token (name and) arguments
| Removes all tokens from the target creature which start with the given chain of token arguments. E.g. [CV_REMOVE_TAG:BODY:HUMANOID_SIMPLE] would remove [BODY:HUMANOID_SIMPLE:3_EYES], but [CV_REMOVE_TAG:BODY:3_EYES] would not. Neither would [CV_REMOVE_TAG:BODY:HUMANOID_SIMPLE] be able to remove [BODY:HUMANOID_SIMPLE_NECK:3_EYES], as it looks for whole arguments. [CV_REMOVE_TAG:BODY] would remove both examples above, as they start with "BODY".

|-
| {{text anchor|CV_CONVERT_TAG}}
|
| Starts a conversion block, containing one {{token|CVCT_MASTER|cv}}, one {{token|CVCT_TARGET|cv}}, and one {{token|CVCT_REPLACEMENT|cv}}. Note that multiple conversion blocks are applied in what might appear as "reverse" order (see [[creature_variation_token#Application|Application]]).

|-
| {{text anchor|CVCT_MASTER}}
|
*leading token (name and) arguments
| Specifies which tokens of the target creature may be converted, by looking at full arguments at the start of said token (like {{token|CV_REMOVE_TAG|cv}}). 

If no CVCT_MASTER is given, it is given no arguments, or the only argument it is given is blank (i.e. [CVCT_MASTER:]), all tokens of the target creature are selected.

|-
| {{text anchor|CVCT_TARGET}}
|
*string
| Locates the specified string within all tokens specified by CVCT_MASTER.

If no CVCT_TARGET is given, it is given no arguments, or the only argument it is given is blank (i.e. [CVCT_TARGET:]), the game will freeze when loading the creature.

|-
| {{text anchor|CVCT_REPLACEMENT}}
|
*string
| Replaces the string specified by CVCT_TARGET within the tokens specified by CVCT_MASTER. This means the targeted part of a token can be changed anywhere in the token, e.g.
 [CV_CONVERT_TAG]
 	[CVCT_MASTER:BODY]
 	[CVCT_TARGET:2EYES]
 	[CVCT_REPLACEMENT:2EYESTALKS]
would affect both [BODY:QUADRUPED_NECK:2EYES:NOSE:2LUNGS:...] and [BODY:INSECT:2EYES:HEART:GUTS:BRAIN:MOUTH:2WINGS], converting them into [BODY:QUADRUPED_NECK:2''EYESTALKS'':NOSE:2LUNGS:...] and [BODY:INSECT:2''EYESTALKS'':HEART:GUTS:BRAIN:MOUTH:2WINGS] respectively.
Colons can be included as part of both the target and the replacement string, e.g. given
 [CV_CONVERT_TAG]
 	[CVCT_MASTER:BODY]
 	[CVCT_TARGET:BASIC_1PARTBODY:BASIC_HEAD]
 	[CVCT_REPLACEMENT:HUMANOID:3FINGERS]
and [BODY:BASIC_1PARTBODY:BASIC_HEAD:HEART:GUTS:BRAIN:MOUTH:2EYESTALKS], you will get [BODY:HUMANOID:3FINGERS:HEART:GUTS:BRAIN:MOUTH:2EYESTALKS]. All occurrences of the target string are replaced, e.g. given
 [CV_CONVERT_TAG]
 	[CVCT_MASTER:DESCRIPTION]
 	[CVCT_TARGET:TRAIT]
 	[CVCT_REPLACEMENT:modderiffic]
and [DESCRIPTION:This is an example creature. It is TRAIT, very very TRAIT.], you will get [DESCRIPTION:This is an example creature. It is modderiffic, very very modderiffic.].

If no CVCT_REPLACEMENT is given, the target string is simply removed.

== Application ==

The two ways of applying creature variations are {{token|APPLY_CREATURE_VARIATION|c}} and {{token|APPLY_CURRENT_CREATURE_VARIATION}}. 
APPLY_CURRENT_CREATURE_VARIATION takes all creature variation tokens before it in the creature raws (and after previous APPLY_CURRENT_CREATURE_VARIATION tokens, if they exist) and applies them. When tokens are added through APPLY_CURRENT_CREATURE_VARIATION, they are added in the place of APPLY_CURRENT_CREATURE_VARIATION.

Creature variations have an unusual order of application. First, remove tokens are applied (bottom-up according to Toady in c_variation_default.txt, though this should never matter). Then, convert tokens are applied bottom-up (in "reverse" order). Finally, add tokens are applied from the top. This means that {{token|CV_REMOVE_TAG|cv}} won't remove any token added by the same creature variation. It is also why more general conversions can (must) be higher up when overlapping {{token|CVCT_MASTER|cv}}s are used. If they were not read bottom-up, e.g. 
 [CV_CONVERT_TAG]
 	[CVCT_MASTER:BODY]
 	[CVCT_TARGET:QUADRUPED]
 	[CVCT_REPLACEMENT:HUMANOID]
would convert [BODY:QUADRUPED_FRONT_GRASP:...] and [BODY:QUADRUPED_NECK:...] into [BODY:HUMANOID_FRONT_GRASP:...] and [BODY:HUMANOID_NECK:...] respectively, before
 [CV_CONVERT_TAG]
 	[CVCT_MASTER:BODY]
 	[CVCT_TARGET:QUADRUPED_FRONT_GRASP]
 	[CVCT_REPLACEMENT:HUMANOID]
 [CV_CONVERT_TAG]
 	[CVCT_MASTER:BODY]
 	[CVCT_TARGET:QUADRUPED_NECK]
 	[CVCT_REPLACEMENT:HUMANOID_NECK:3FINGERS]
could convert them into the expected [BODY:HUMANOID:...] and [BODY:HUMANOID_NECK:3_FINGERS:...], as should be.

== Arguments and conditional tokens ==

{{token|APPLY_CREATURE_VARIATION|cv}} may be given arguments (in addition to the required creature variation ID). These arguments will replace instances of "!ARG''n''", where ''n'' is the index of the argument given to APPLY_CREATURE_VARIATION; the first argument will replace any "!ARG1", the second any "!ARG2" and so on. You may use any number of arguments<sup>1</sup>.
If you have an "!ARG''n''" of a higher number than the argument given the replacements will act oddly, depending on if ''n'' has more digits than the number of arguments given. E.g. [APPLY_CREATURE_VARIATION:EXAMPLE_CV:one:two:three], which has three arguments given, will leave all "!ARG5" in EXAMPLE_CV intact as "!ARG5", but "!ARG10" will become "one0".

The pipe character "|" is turned into ":" when inserted, so single arguments in APPLY_CREATURE_VARIATION may be turned into multi-argument segments in the output. E.g. given 
 [CREATURE_VARIATION:DIMORPHIC_FEATHER_COLORS]
 	[CV_NEW_TAG:SELECT_CASTE:FEMALE]
 		[CV_NEW_TAG:SET_TL_GROUP:BY_CATEGORY:ALL:FEATHER]
 			[CV_NEW_TAG:TL_COLOR_MODIFIER:!ARG1]
 				[CV_NEW_TAG:TLCM_NOUN:feathers:PLURAL]
 	[CV_NEW_TAG:SELECT_CASTE:MALE]
 		[CV_NEW_TAG:SET_TL_GROUP:BY_CATEGORY:ALL:FEATHER]
 			[CV_NEW_TAG:TL_COLOR_MODIFIER:!ARG2]
 				[CV_NEW_TAG:TLCM_NOUN:feathers:PLURAL]
 	[CV_NEW_TAG:SELECT_CASTE:ALL]
and [APPLY_CREATURE_VARIATION:DIMORPHIC_FEATHER_COLORS:BROWN|1:BLUE|10|GREEN|1|BLACK|1] we get
 [SELECT_CASTE:FEMALE]
 	[SET_TL_GROUP:BY_CATEGORY:ALL:FEATHER]
 		[TL_COLOR_MODIFIER:BROWN:1]
 			[TLCM_NOUN:feathers:PLURAL]
 [SELECT_CASTE:MALE]
 	[SET_TL_GROUP:BY_CATEGORY:ALL:FEATHER]
 		[TL_COLOR_MODIFIER:BLUE:10:GREEN:1:BLACK:1]
 			[TLCM_NOUN:feathers:PLURAL]
 [SELECT_CASTE:ALL]
as the tokens added to the target creature.

The conditional tags ({{token|CV_NEW_CTAG|cv}}/{{token|CV_ADD_CTAG|cv}}, {{token|CV_REMOVE_CTAG|cv}} and {{token|CV_CONVERT_CTAG|cv}}) are copies of CV_NEW_TAG/CV_ADD_TAG, CV_REMOVE_TAG and CV_CONVERT_TAG, except they only work if a numbered argument of APPLY_CREATURE_VARIATION has an arbitrary value. E.g. [CV_ADD_CTAG:2:HUMANOID:CAN_SPEAK] will only add [CAN_SPEAK] if argument number two is "HUMANOID".

<sup>1</sup>Functionally. Up to 65537=2<sup>16</sup>+1 arguments have been tested, with no problems other than a long load time.

===Example===

The following is an example of a creature variation, demonstrating most of the tokens and arguments mentioned above; with an explanation of how you would use it to change the properties of a cow.

 [CREATURE_VARIATION:CREATURE_EDIT]
     [CV_CONVERT_CTAG:1:NAME]
         [CVCT_MASTER:NAME]
         [CVCT_TARGET:!ARG3:!ARG3s:!ARG4]
         [CVCT_REPLACEMENT:!ARG5:!ARG5s:!ARG6]
     [CV_CONVERT_CTAG:2:CNAME]
         [CVCT_MASTER:CASTE_NAME]
         [CVCT_TARGET:!ARG3:!ARG3s:!ARG4]
         [CVCT_REPLACEMENT:!ARG5:!ARG5s:!ARG6]
     [CV_NEW_CTAG:7:FC:SELECT_CASTE:FEMALE]
     [CV_NEW_CTAG:7:FC:COLOR:!ARG8]
     [CV_CONVERT_TAG]
         [CVCT_MASTER:STATE_NAME:LIQUID]
         [CVCT_TARGET:!ARG3's milk]
         [CVCT_REPLACEMENT:!ARG5's milk]
     [CV_CONVERT_TAG]
         [CVCT_MASTER:STATE_ADJ:LIQUID]
         [CVCT_TARGET:!ARG3's milk]
         [CVCT_REPLACEMENT:!ARG5's milk]
     [CV_NEW_CTAG:9:MRED:SELECT_CASTE:MALE]
     [CV_NEW_CTAG:9:MREL:CASTE_COLOR:4:0:0]
     [CV_NEW_CTAG:9:MYEL:SELECT_CASTE:MALE]
     [CV_NEW_CTAG:9:MYEL:CASTE_COLOR:6:0:1]

We add the following to a creature file.

     [SELECT_CREATURE:COW]
         [APPLY_CREATURE_VARIATION:CREATURE_EDIT:X:CNAME:cow:bovine:super-cow:cowtastic:FC:7|0|1:MYEL]

This will change the cow creature file so that the cows are now called "super-cows", which can be described as "cowtastic", are white colored and produce "super-cow's milk", and it will also change the color of the bulls to yellow.

Here is a step-by-step explanation of what is happening in order of the arguments:

* "X" doesn't match the first CTAG argument of "NAME", so we have decided not to change the overall name of the creature.
* "CNAME" does match the second CTAG so we are changing the name of a caste which matches arguments !ARG3 & !ARG4, as well as looking for specific liquids with state names that contain !ARG3 followed by the characters "'s milk".
* Using arguments 3 & 4 we look for a caste name that matches "cow:cows:bovine" and any liquid name or adjective that matches "cow's milk".
* The caste name and liquids do exist, so !ARG5 & !ARG6 now declare what we want to change these names to; in this case the caste name "super-cow:super-cows:cowtastic" and liquid name and adjective "super-cow's milk".
* Now we declare that we want CTAG argument 7 to match "FC" which means we will select the [FEMALE] caste and add a color to it which is decided by the next argument !ARG8.
* We need to choose three digits but they need to be separated by ":". Using this character here will move us onto the next argument, so we separate the digits with "|" instead choosing "7|0|1" (white), for a white cow (not necessarily represented by the graphics).
* The next argument has multiple CTAGs numbered "9", but with different arguments. Either option will use [SELECT_CASTE:MALE] but we can choose between the argument MRED or MYEL. We have chosen MYEL which adds the tag [CASTE_COLOR:6:0:1] (yellow) for us, giving the male caste (in this case a bull) yellow as a caste color.
