'''Rhinoceros men''' are [[animal people]] versions of the common [[rhinoceros]], who can be found in [[savage]] [[tropical]] flatlands. They spawn in groups of 5-10 individuals and should never be approached by common peasants, as they rank among the largest of all animal people (being about as heavy as a [[hippo]], or 25 times larger than a [[dwarf]]), and, as such, are easily able to tear an unsuspecting intruder apart.

Like other savage animal people, they can join [[civilization]]s, become [[historical figure]]s, appear as [[visitor]]s and be playable in [[adventurer mode]].

Some dwarves [[Preferences|like]] rhinoceros men for their ''horns''.
