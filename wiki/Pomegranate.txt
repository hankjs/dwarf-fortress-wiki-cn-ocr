'''Pomegranate''' is one of the many genera of [[tree]]s found above ground. Like the vast majority of above ground trees, pomegranate [[wood]] is brown and produces brown products.

Pomegranate trees bear pomegranate [[fruit]] that can be harvested by setting up a gathering [[zone]]. They can be eaten raw, cooked, or brewed into [[alcohol|pomegranate wine]].

Logs, leaves and fruits can be processed in a [[dyer's shop]] into different [[dye|dyes]] - logs for gray, leaves for yellow and fruits for green-yellow.

Some [[Dwarf|dwarves]] [[Preferences|like]] pomegranate trees for their ''fruit''.
