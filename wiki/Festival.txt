A '''festival''' is a [[world gen]]-only event that can be looked up in [[Legends]] mode. Their main purpose at this point is to provide something interesting and interconnecting for the various artists to do, such as [[poet]]s, [[dancer]]s, or [[instrument]]alists. The [[Release information/0.47.01|villains release]] also uses festivals to increase relationships between historical figures, so villains can build networks more effectively.

The festivals that rise to the level of importance required for legends mode tracking are established either as part of a fair in large markets with multiple trade partners, for religious purposes in temple cities, or to commemorate specific events, such as the slaying of a dragon or the ascension of a law-giver. The game looks at the [[values]] and [[ethics]] of the civilization and the overall purpose of the occasion to come up with the schedule of events -- performances, competitions (from art to various races to wrestling, etc.), processions and ceremonies, with various little details. Some examples include candle processions, poetry recitals, foot races or throwing competitions.

Festivals cannot be seen in play, though it is planned at some point to allow adventurers to participate in the activities. Because the latter is not possible yet, festivals do not happen after world gen ends <sup>[http://www.bay12forums.com/smf/index.php?topic=159164.msg7632503;topicseen#msg7632503 1] [http://www.bay12forums.com/smf/index.php?topic=140544.msg6528473;topicseen#msg6528473 2]</sup>. As it stands, festivals are currently a very minor mechanic that provides background flavor.
