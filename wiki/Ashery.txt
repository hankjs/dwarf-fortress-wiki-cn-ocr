The '''ashery''' is a [[workshop]] used to make [[lye]], [[potash]], and [[milk of lime]]. To build an ashery, you need a [[block]]*, a [[barrel]], a [[bucket]], and someone with the [[potash maker|potash making]] or [[Lye maker|lye making]] [[labor]] enabled.  

: (* Notably, this is distinct from most other workshops, in that you cannot use a rough [[stone]] or [[log]] to build an ashery, it ''must'' be a block of some sort. The block does not need to be [[fire-safe]].)

Lye is one of the main ingredients for [[soap]], which is used for [[cleaning]] [[wound]]s and the fortress, while milk of lime is used to make [[parchment]] [[sheet]]s out of raw animal [[skin]]s for the [[paper industry]]. [[Potash]] is used for fertilizing [[farm plot|farms]], allowing an increased output of [[plants]], as well as for the creation of [[pearlash]], necessary for [[clear glass]] and [[crystal glass]].
