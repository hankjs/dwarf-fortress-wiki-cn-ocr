'''Peppers''' are an [[aboveground]] [[crop|garden plant]]. They can be planted in all seasons and the pepper is edible raw or [[cooking|cooked]].

''Dwarf Fortress'' peppers are based on the American ''Capsicum'' fruits, not on the old world true peppers (genus ''Piper'').

Some [[Dwarf|dwarves]] [[preferences|like]] pepper plants for their ''fruit''.

Spiciness is not modeled in ''Dwarf Fortress'', perhaps as a kindness to the poor Urist who decides to eat a raw wild pepper for dinner.
