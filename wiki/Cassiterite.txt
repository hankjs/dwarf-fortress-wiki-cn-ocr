'''Cassiterite''' is the only [[ore]] of [[tin]].  This ore can also be smelted into the [[alloy]]s [[bronze]], [[trifle pewter]], and [[fine pewter]].

Cassiterite is also the main component of [[tin glaze]].

It is found in [[alluvial]] layers as small [[cluster]]s and in [[granite]] as [[vein]]s.

== Smelting ==
Cassiterite is a required ingredient to make several types of metal alloy bars from ore at a [[smelter]]:
	
* [[Tin]] bars
* [[Bronze]] bars - with [[native copper]], [[malachite]], or [[tetrahedrite]]
* [[Trifle pewter]] bars - with [[native copper]], [[malachite]] or [[tetrahedrite]] ''(takes 2 cassiterite)''
* [[Fine pewter]] bars - with [[native copper]], [[malachite]] or [[tetrahedrite]] ''(takes 3 cassiterite)''

The above can also be made from [[bar]]s of [[tin]] combined with bars of the appropriate metals.  Note that [[bismuth bronze]] and [[lay pewter]], both of which require tin, cannot be made directly from cassiterite, but must be made using tin bars.

See [[metal]] for a full discussion of formulae and options.
