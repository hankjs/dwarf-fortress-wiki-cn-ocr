'''Dragonfly men''' are [[animal people]] variants of the common [[dragonfly]] who can be found in [[savage]] [[lake]]s. They spawn in groups of 2-5 individuals and are generally content to keep to themselves, but may pick fights if provoked. In terms of size, they are a little over half the weight of the average [[dwarf]]. All dragonfly men are born with Legendary [[skill]] in [[Climber|climbing]].

Some dwarves [[Preferences|like]] dragonfly men for their ''faceted eyes''.
==Trivia==
*The dragonfly man uses the exact same sprite as the [[damselfly man]].
