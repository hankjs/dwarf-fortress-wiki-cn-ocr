'''Giant vultures''' are enlarged [[Creature|cousins]] of the common [[vulture]], found in [[savage]] [[desert]]s and some [[tropical]] plains. While their smaller counterparts usually do little more than cause job cancellation spam and fly off with a [[plump helmet]] sometimes, giant vultures are considerably more dangerous; not only do they retain the habit of [[steals food|stealing food]], they are over four times the [[size]] of a [[dwarf]] and can be deadly to civilians who try to stop them during their thieving dives into your supplies (all while still causing lots of job cancellation spam). This makes them a real threat to a young savage embark, and if there are giant vultures in the region, the player should consider taking their food underground as soon as possible.

Like their small cousins, one can capture giant vultures with [[cage]] [[trap]]s and [[Animal trainer|train]] them into [[pet]]s, who possess the standard high value of a giant creature. They are not any better than normal vultures when it comes to laying [[egg]]s, though they are comparably much better for a [[meat industry]] as they create a much higher quantity of [[meat]], [[bone]]s and [[fat]]. Giant vultures are also exotic [[mount]]s, so you may see [[Elf|elves]] riding them into battle in the event of a [[siege]].

Some dwarves [[Preferences|like]] giant vultures for their ''patience''.
