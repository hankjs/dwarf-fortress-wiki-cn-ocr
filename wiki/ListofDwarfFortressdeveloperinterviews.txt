**Procedural content generation has garnered more attention in recent years, both in indie games and AAA titles. Unfortunately, there is no "one algorithm to rule them all". PCG techniques are necessarily as wide and varied as their potential implementations. Using examples from the speakers' own work, this lecture presents 6 practical ways to implement AI-driven procedural content generation in games.

Designers from Dwarf Fortress and Moon Hunters will share their tools and methods for implementing procedurally generated experiences, by live-editing their game systems during this session.
