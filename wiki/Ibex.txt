'''Ibexes''' are wild [[Creature|animals]] closely related to [[goat]]s who may be found inhabiting [[grassland]]s and [[desert]]s. They appear in groups of 1-4 individuals and meander around the area, minding their own business. They are benign and will normally flee from [[Dwarf|dwarves]], but may rarely defend themselves with bites and kicks. A baby ibex is called a ''kid''.

Ibexes can be captured in [[cage]] [[trap]]s and [[Animal trainer|trained]] into exotic [[pet]]s. In terms of [[size]] and value, ibexes are identical to goats and as such perform the same way in a [[meat industry]], though unlike their domesticated cousins, they don't produce [[milk]]. Like domestic goats, a trained ibex will require a [[pasture]] in order to not starve.

Some dwarves [[Preferences|like]] ibexes for their ''long horns''.
