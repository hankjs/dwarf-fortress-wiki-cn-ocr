:* ''This page is about the administrative position within a fortress. For the [[skill]], see [[Leader]].''

The '''expedition leader''' is an [[Noble|administrative]] position automatically filled on [[embark]]. It is the job of this official to speak with, and console or simply hear the complaints of unhappy dwarves, and to entertain foreign diplomats. Once the population reaches 50, a [[mayor]] will be [[elected]] and the expedition leader position will be removed.

An expedition leader or mayor is required to appoint other administrators; they are also able to appoint replacements for elected positions, including their own, or remove current appointments, leaving the position empty. Should your leader suffer an [[unfortunate accident]] or be removed, you will have to wait for a new leader to be elected to be able to appoint any administrators; this can happen within a day. However, if the civilization is dead, the election will never happen and you will be unable to appoint a new leader or other officials.

There is a certain set of [[skills]] that are relevant for an expedition leader. There are also certain [[Personality|personality traits]] that influence whether experience is gained in the skill whatsoever. Furthermore, there are [[Attributes#Soul_Attributes|soul attributes]] that affect the skills and other skills that affect these same attributes ([[cross-training]]); the ones relevant for an expedition leader are as follows:

The better match with the skills, traits and attributes in the table, the better an expedition leader the dwarf will be; try to avoid traits that halt experience gain for a relevant skill, otherwise time will be lost training a dwarf that will never get better at that skill.

== Bugs ==
* It has long been debated whether their being able to replace or remove elected positions including themselves is a bug.{{bug|2512}}
* If the fortress population drops to 1 child or insane dwarf, can't appoint or elect nobles when migrants arrive.{{bug|5299}}
* After passing the 50-dwarf-threshold, election for Mayor doesn't happen until any change is made to nobles screen.{{bug|8514}}
* An empty expedition leader position cannot be refilled in a dead civilization and thus appointed positions also cannot be filled.{{bug|11559}}
