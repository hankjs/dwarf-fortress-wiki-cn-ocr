'''Giant bobcats''' are the gigantic [[savage]] version of regular [[bobcat]]s. Regular bobcats are some of the smallest predators in the game, but at 256,320 cm<sup>3</sup> giant bobcats are not small creatures, lying between [[tiger]]s (the largest non-giant big cat) and [[muskox]]en in size. Interestingly, their creature definitions do not have a {{token|LARGE_PREDATOR}} tag, so giant bobcats will still flee from contact with your [[dwarves]], despite being more than four times as large. Like their normal counterparts, giant bobcats are extremely uncommon to encounter and no more than 3 of them will exist in the map before they're locally [[extinct]].

Giant bobcats can be captured, trained, and turned into war or hunting animals. They thus make excellent dwarven companions, given their large size, although in a savage biome you might be able to field a better option - [[giant tiger]]s, for instance, are almost eight times as large.

Some dwarves [[Preferences|like]] giant bobcats for their ''short tails''.
