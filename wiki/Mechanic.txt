'''Mechanic''' is the [[skill]] associated with the '''mechanics''' [[labor]]. Mechanics can work at a [[mechanic's workshop]] or a [[metalsmith's forge]] to manufacture [[mechanism]]s, and place any [[building]]s that require mechanisms such as [[lever]]s, [[Gear assembly|gear]]s and [[trap]]s. They are also responsible for linking up [[lever]]s or [[pressure plate]]s to objects such as [[bridge]]s, [[floodgate]]s and other [[trap design|contraptions]].

A dwarf will gain mechanics skill by manufacturing [[mechanism]]s in the [[mechanic's workshop]]. A dwarf with a high skill in mechanics will typically produce higher quality mechanisms, and can link up objects faster than a novice. High quality mechanisms may provide happy [[thought]]s to passing dwarves.  Skill is also gained by loading cage traps, and by completing linking tasks.

Mechanics can also make [[traction bench]]es, which are occasionally needed by doctors to treat compound fractures.

To manufacture metal mechanisms, navigate into the trap component sub-menu at any metalsmith's forge. This process will use the '''mechanics''' [[labor]].

The mechanic skill is also used by [[scholars]] when thinking about engineering-related [[topics]].
