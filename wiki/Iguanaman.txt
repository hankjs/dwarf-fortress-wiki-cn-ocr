'''Iguana men''' are humanoid versions of the common [[iguana]], a [[Creature|species]] of unremarkable [[animal people]] found in [[savage]] [[tropical]] [[forest]]s. They are a little over half the size of an adult [[dwarf]] and spawn in groups of 1-3 individuals, who are unlikely to pose any danger to your fortress.

Like other savage animal people, iguana men may occasionally join [[civilization]]s, becoming full-fledged citizens who may appear in your fortress as [[visitor]]s or be playable in [[adventurer mode]].

Despite not being able to be butchered, iguana man products are worth twice as much as others.

Some dwarves [[Preferences|like]] iguana men for their ''[[wikipedia:dewlap|dewlaps]]'' and their ''head bobs''.
