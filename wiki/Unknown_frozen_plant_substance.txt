'''Unknown frozen plant substance''' is a placeholder [[plant]] [[material]]. It can occasionally appear in-game as a result of [[bug]]s (''either that, or some [[duplicated raws|very unwise mod-adjacent meddling]]''). It is a light gray solid that is not affected by [[temperature]], similarly to other undefined materials.
