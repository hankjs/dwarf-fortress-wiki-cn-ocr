[[File:horn_sprite_large.png|right]]'''Horn''' is the generic name for both the hooves and horns of animals. In ''Dwarf Fortress'', hooves and horns are functionally identical once stripped from their previous owners. Both are obtained by [[Butcher's shop|butchering]] certain animals, although horns are often only present on the male members of a particular species.  In certain cases, horns may also be referred to as antlers, as is the case with [[elk]].  They can either be carved into horn [[crafts]], or used to [[decoration|decorate]] existing crafts at the [[craftsdwarf's workshop]]; doing so uses the [[bone carver]] labor.

Creatures with horns and hooves can be very formidable in combat, especially since most of them are several times larger than your average dwarf - they have the ability to cave in skulls or bruise internal organs. It is best to approach all hoof/horn-wielding creatures with caution.

== Adventure mode ==
Unlike ordinary [[bone]], horns or hooves cannot be used in adventurer bone carving, although they're still produced by butchering.
