'''Lye''' is a [[liquid]] used to make [[soap]], and can also be used to make [[potash]] (Although potash is more easily made directly from ash, which is also the precursor to lye). Lye is made by a [[lye maker]] at an [[ashery]], and requires 1 [[bar]] of [[ash]] and an empty [[bucket]]; ash is made from [[wood]] by a wood burner at a [[wood furnace]].

Lye is moved from buckets into a [[barrel]] if you have a [[Stockpile#Food|food stockpile]] with "lye" enabled and a spare barrel, and each barrel will hold up to 100 units. Lye can also be ordered in [[trade agreement]]s, and each barrel brought by a [[caravan]] will contain a stack of 10 units.

== Frozen lye ==
Lye freezes in cold weather – you'll have to wait until it thaws in order to make [[soap]]. Lye can be moved to a warmer [[underground]] location to thaw it. Alternatively, careful application of [[magma]] may be used. However, there is no entry for frozen lye in stockpile menus, so dwarves will not haul a frozen lye barrel to any type of stockpile.

Barrels containing frozen lye can be moved [[underground]] to thaw by dumping them to a [[garbage dump]], but if you use the [[Designations Menu]] to mark the barrels, the frozen lye stack will be marked for dumping separately, and when it is hauled inside, it will melt into a useless puddle on the floor. Instead, select the barrel and click dump [[File:Dump option icon.png|30px]] on it to mark just the barrel for dumping, and its contents will stay inside.

If your [[trade depot]] is outdoors in freezing weather, frozen lye (or [[milk#Dwarven_ice_cream|milk]]) barrels will appear as empty barrels in the [[Trading]] screen. They can be distinguished from empty barrels by having a price 20☼ higher than the price of the barrel, or by viewing their contents. If purchased, these will also have to be dumped to thaw the lye, or will have to wait for better weather.
