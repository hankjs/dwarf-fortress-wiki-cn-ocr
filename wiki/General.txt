The '''general''' is the highest-ranking member of the mostly-unrealized, civilization-wide dwarven army, responsible for determining military strategy as well as the appointment of [[lieutenant]]s and [[captain]]s. The general commands the lieutenants, who in turn command the captains. The general arrives alongside the [[monarch]]. 

In the current implementation, there does not seem to be anything special about the general. There are no squads under the general's control.

[[Human]] and [[goblin]] civilizations occasionally have generals as one of their variable positions, but they aren't guaranteed.

[[Elf|Elves]] additionally have the princess role, with the same functions and likewise appointing [[ranger captain]]s. Despite the name, the position is not inherited, instead appointed by the [[druid]]. However, the princess is defined as the successor to the [[monarch|queen]].
