'''Ocelots''' are very rare [[Creature|animals]] found in a number of [[tropical]] [[biome]]s, from [[forest]]s to [[Wetland|mangrove swamps]], where they appear one at a time. Weighing less than half the weight of a [[dwarf]], these carnivores are only a real threat to your smaller [[domestic animal]]s. On top of low frequency rate, no more than 3 ocelots will exist in a single biome before they're considered locally [[extinct]]. A newborn ocelot is called a ''cub'', and all members of the species are born with Legendary [[skill]] in [[Climber|climbing]].

Ocelots can be captured in [[cage]] [[trap]]s and [[Animal trainer|trained]] into exotic [[pet]]s, and they're also sometimes brought along with [[Elf|elven]] [[caravan]]s. They can receive additional war or hunting training as well, making them equivalent to war dogs in capabilities, though their {{token|MEANDERER}} tag will cause them to move around very slowly{{Bug|9588}}. Products made from ocelot parts, should you choose to [[butcher]] them, are [[item value|worth]] twice more than those made from parts of common animals. Ocelots take 3 years to reach adulthood, though they're fully grown by the age of 2.

Some dwarves [[Preferences|like]] ocelots for their ''coat patterns''.
