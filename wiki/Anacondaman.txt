'''Anaconda men''' are [[animal people]] variants of the common [[anaconda]] who can be found in [[savage]] [[tropical]] [[wetland]]s, spawning in groups of 1-5 individuals, and may injure [[dwarves]] who attempt to provoke them. In terms of size, they are a little larger than [[human]]s.

Like other savage animal people, anaconda men can join [[civilization]]s, become [[historical figure]]s, appear as [[visitor]]s and be playable in [[adventurer mode]].

Some dwarves [[Preferences|like]] anaconda men for their ''great size''.
