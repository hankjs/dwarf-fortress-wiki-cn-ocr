[[File:meat_sprite_large.png|right]]'''Meat''' is a collective term for all non-aquatic-[[vermin]] edible, animal [[butcher]]y products, and a [[food]] staple which can make up a significant part of a fortress's diet. Although the [[status]] bar and [[stocks]] window categorize all edible butchery products as meat, the game names them variously: true "{creature type} meat", which is muscle, and [[prepared organs]], both produced when the [[creature]] is [[butcher's shop|butchered]]. The amount of meat products produced depends on the individual creature's absolute size, which is a combination of the species' average size and any creature-specific modifiers (height, broadness, etc.).

Dwarves (''and humans, of course'') are omnivores; having meat to eat is not compulsory, but does increase variety (munching on the same gruel day after day will eventually cause negative [[thought]]s). If there is no meat in your stocks, carnivorous creatures (such as some species of [[animal people]]) will go hungry, and [[animal trainer]]s will be unable to perform the initial training on any wild carnivores. [[Starving]] carnivorous citizens will auto-assign the job "hunt for small animal". [[Prepared meal]]s containing meat apparently also qualify as meat, for the purpose of feeding carnivores.

Like most types of [[food]], meat will [[rot]] if not [[stockpile]]d appropriately, becoming unfit for consumption and emitting [[miasma]] over time if left [[underground]].
