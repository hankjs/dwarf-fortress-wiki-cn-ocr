'''Giant impalas''' are slightly larger than an average [[horse]], and roughly as threatening. They normally appear in [[savage]] tropical grasslands and savanna, though [[elf|elven]] [[caravan]]s and [[siege]]s may bring them to fortresses located in other [[biome]]s.  

Tame giant impalas have a moderately-high pet value (the same as most other giant creatures), and require grass to [[grazer|graze]]. Some dwarves [[preference|like]] giant impalas for their "mighty leaps".
