'''Muck root''' is an [[tile_attributes|aboveground]] [[crop]]. It can be [[food|eaten]] raw, [[cook|cooked]], or [[brewer|brewed]] into [[Alcohol|swamp whiskey]]. However, it is not as [[value|delicious]] as any of the [[underground]] crops. Muck root has [[seed]]s and can be [[farm]]ed, and it takes about 25 days to grow.

Some [[dwarves]] [[Preferences|like]] muck roots for their ''twisting shape''.
