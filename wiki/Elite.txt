Any military dwarf that is sufficiently [[skill]]ed with a [[weapon]] will become '''elite'''. Any dwarf that has attained Great or higher skill with a weapon will become elite with that weapon. Elite dwarves are a blessing; in addition to being great fighters, they will no longer complain about long patrol duty, instead relishing opportunities to train and fight. They will function like permanent soldiers as opposed to your militia, and so long as they are assigned to a [[squad]], will either follow orders, or go to individual training (only rarely will they perform their jobs).
