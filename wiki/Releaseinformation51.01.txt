:Alexandra here with a post-Adventure Mode beta launch update. We hope you’re enjoying all the mischief and mayhem that the beta has to offer. Some of the stories you’ve been sharing have been hilarious and thought-provoking to say the least. [https://www.reddit.com/r/dwarffortress/comments/1c6eya2/i_accidentally_killed_a_traveler/ This story] about stealing a shield gone wrong made me laugh a lot.
