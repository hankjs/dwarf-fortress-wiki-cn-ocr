'''Rattlesnake men''' are [[animal people]] versions of the common [[rattlesnake]], who can be found in any non-freezing [[savage]] region. They spawn in groups of 1-3 individuals and are generally content to keep to themselves, but like their animal versions, their bite possesses a strong [[syndrome]] which should be avoided. In terms of size, they are a little over half the weight of the average [[dwarf]].

Rattlesnake men will attempt to attack your livestock, but not your dwarves.

Like other savage animal people, they can join [[civilization]]s, become [[historical figure]]s, appear as [[visitor]]s and be playable in [[adventurer mode]].

Some dwarves [[Preferences|like]] rattlesnake men for their ''warning rattle''.
