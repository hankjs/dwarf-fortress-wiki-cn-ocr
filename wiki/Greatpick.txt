A '''great pick''' is an alternative to [[pick]]s sized for large creatures. [[Troll]], [[ogre]], and [[blind cave ogre]] [[miner]]s from dark [[goblin]] [[Dark pits|pits]] can arrive in [[siege]]s wielding this [[weapon]].

A great pick is eight times the [[Weapon#size|size]] of a standard pick - that is, it has the same internal [[Attack types|attack properties]], but hits with more force due to its size. A creature must be at least 225,000 cm³ to wield it, with [[List of creatures by adult size|some large species]] of [[animal people]] being the smallest creatures that can equip it in [[fortress mode]].

When [[Melt item|melted]] down, great picks produce roughly four bars of metal.
