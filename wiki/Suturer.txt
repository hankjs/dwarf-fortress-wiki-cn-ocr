[[File:elf_suture_preview.png|thumb|288px|right|An elf dancer with stitches on her right leg and foot, still not effecting her skillful dancing.]]'''Suturer''' is the skill associated with the suturing [[labor]]. Suturers are responsible for closing wounds using [[thread]] at a [[hospital]]. Additionally, in the latest version, dwarves who discuss or ponder the [[topic]] "Suturing" as scholars will gain points in this skill.

Suturer [[skill|skill level]] is related to the speed at which the labor is completed. The longer that the wound is open, the more likely bleeding out and infection become, although soap cleaning mitigates the latter and [[wound dresser|wound dressing]] mitigates the former. The quality, type or dye of the thread is not related to outcome - suturers will even use [[adamantine]] strands for this purpose. Severed limbs are beyond your suturers' abilities, even at Legendary+5.

Suturers put your fortress' injured back together, as part of the [[health care|health care industry]].  The suturer skill is also used by [[scholars]] when thinking about medical science-related [[topics]]:
