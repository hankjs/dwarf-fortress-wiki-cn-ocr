'''Giant pangolins''' are enlarged [[Creature|cousins]] of the common [[pangolin]], found in [[savage]] [[tropical]] plains and [[forest]]s. Despite being nearly four times the size of a [[dwarf]], they are just as benign as their original counterparts, doing little more than rooting around the grass and eating [[vermin|bugs]] along the way. The difference is, they are more capable of fighting back when cornered than a normal pangolin, though they should still not pose a threat to a [[hunter]].

Giant pangolins can be captured in [[cage]] [[trap]]s and [[Animal trainer|trained]] into [[pet]]s, possessing the standard high value of a giant creature. They produce an average amount of [[meat]], [[bone]]s and [[fat]] when [[butcher]]ed, making them a choice for a [[meat industry]] if a breeding pair is obtained. Like normal pangolins, they possess [[Skin|scales]] rather than skin, and are therefore unusable for creating [[leather]].

Some dwarves [[Preferences|like]] giant pangolins for their ''overlapping scales''.
