* MOTTLED: Takes any amount of CP_COLOR tokens.
* IRIS_EYE: Only shows the third CP_COLOR given; technically takes any amount. Causes a crash if no CP_COLOR is given{{bug|11806}}. If only one or two CP_COLORs is given, the tissue is described as being "transparent".
* PUPIL_EYE: Only shows the second CP_COLOR given; technically takes any amount. Causes a crash if no CP_COLOR is given{{bug|11806}}. If only one CP_COLORs is given, the tissue is described as being "transparent".
