'''Liquid''' (internally {{token|LIQUID_MISC|i}}) is a classification under the [[stocks]] menu, containing fluids (alcoholic [[drink]]s are separate) such as [[water]], [[milk]], [[lye]], [[dwarven syrup]], [[honey]] and [[royal jelly]].

Royal jelly which is still part of one of your [[hive]]s is also shown here, while honey will only be shown after it has been [[screw press|pressed]] from a [[honeycomb]].
It also lists [[ichor]], [[blood]] and [[venom]], which [[caravan]]s have been known to bring filled barrels of.

All liquids can be {{Adv menu icon|e}} [[Thirst|ingested]] in [[Adventure mode]], regardless of [[ethic]]s.

== Water ==

Though dwarves prefer [[alcohol]], drinking [[water]] from a [[river]] or a [[well]] will satisfy their basic needs. [[Soldier|Militia-dwarves]] equipped with any type of [[flask]] are able to [[Storage|store]] water on their person.

Water can be transported to and from [[Zone#Pit/Pond|pond zones]] in [[bucket]]s and through [[minecart]] routes.

An adventurer starts with a [[waterskin]] filled with 3 units of water by default, and can {{k|i}}nteract with it near a source of water to fill it up again.

== Extracts ==
''Main article: [[Extract]]''

[[Extract]]s are made from organic sources by many professions, including some specialized in the creation of extracts. [[Milk]] is stored in [[bucket]]s and [[stockpile|stockpiled]] [[barrel]]s, [[plant]] extracts use either [[vial]]s or [[barrel]]s depending on type, and liquid products from [[beekeeping]] and a [[screw press]] use [[jug]]s (or any tool with the <code>LIQUID_STORAGE</code> usage).

Some extracts are [[Syndrome|poisonous]], such as the [[venom]] of a spider or [[gnomeblight]], an [[Dark gnome|oddly]]-[[Mountain gnome|specific]] toxin extracted from [[kobold bulbs]]. Fortress citizens cannot apply poisons to [[weapon]]s on their own, as it requires contaminating the item with a [[contaminant|spatter]] of poison.

== Chemicals ==

A [[lye maker]] working at an [[ashery]] can refine [[lye]] and [[milk of lime]], intermediary products for [[soap]] and [[parchment]] respectively. While these materials are toxic in real life, spilling them on a creature lacks any [[Syndrome|adverse effects]].

[[Magma]] may also be listed as a liquid. This happens whenever the magma fluid melts a non [[magma-safe]] [[stone]], or when a [[minecart]] is set to pick up magma. As the raws for any stone list their liquid state as magma, when the magma fluid melts the rocks, they become listed as a magma [[glob]] on the [[stocks]] page.
