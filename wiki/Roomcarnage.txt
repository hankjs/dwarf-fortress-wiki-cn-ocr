'''Roomcarnage''' is a v0.34.11 fortress presented in the style of a serialized epic. Over the course of more than seventy updates since June 2014, it chronicles the rise of the dwarves of the Momentous Dye in a particularly interesting embark location: a [[terrifying]] [[glacier]] [[volcano]] that rains [[elf]] blood. The most notable feature of the fortress is the ongoing weaponization of the volcano itself, finally realized in the twenty-second installment. 

In addition to the constant reanimation of dead animals, dwarves, and parts thereof; foul fog zombie liaisons and caravans; and a mysterious vampire cult, the dwarves of Roomcarnage have dealt with the horrors of nakedness, encroaching FPS death, and — worst of all! — alcohol deprivation.
