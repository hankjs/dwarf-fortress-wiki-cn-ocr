The '''Dyer's shop''' is the [[workshop]] used to [[dye]] [[thread]], [[cloth]], and [[leather]]. It requires a [[barrel]] and a [[bucket]] to build, and must be built by a [[dwarf]] with the [[Dyer|Dyeing]] [[labor]] enabled. Dyeing increases the [[value]] of the dyed material, which can be useful for [[trading]]. The products that dyes can't be applied to, however, are finished goods, such as [[clothing]], [[bag]]s, or [[crafts]].

A number of [[plant]]s produce dye. Some must be [[Miller|milled]] at a [[millstone]] or [[quern]], while others can be processed into dye at this workshop using the [[thresher]] skill.

When dyeing a material, you can specify its color. You can use the dye's full color, blend it with another dye, or create an intermediate shade between it and the material's natural color.

The name of this workshop changes based on the {{token|PROFESSION_NAME|c|DYER}} of your fortress's primary race.
