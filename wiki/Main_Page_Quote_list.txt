The cyclops I was quested to kill had a thousand year history of badassery, and all of that without the leg it lost in the Year 3 (a dwarf bit it off... I should probably deal with that). — [[Toady One]]

The zombies in a necromancer's tower became suspicious after the necromancer failed to age — [[Toady One]]
I'd have to look back to see if it wants the physical or metaphysical id on the corpse. — [[Toady One]]
I also got started on [[Jump|jumping]]. My first jump was off by a factor of 100, so I flew against a cliff and blew apart. I'm still working on it. — [[Toady One]]
The king of my dwarves appointed a visiting merchant's yak as the general of the army while I was trading. — [[Toady One]]

An impressionable child, she inherited the goblin ethics of [[personality value|valuing]] power over others and her personal dream is to take over the world. I'm sure it'll be fine. — [[Toady One]]
I've got a fort that has an export industry centered entirely around little commemorative [[dacite]] figurines of the starting seven dwarves in different poses. Eventually we'll have to make the merchants more discerning — [[Toady One]]
"If a sieging army wants to talk, there's an initial petition to arrange a parley, which is not delivered physically — they hang back outside in relative safety, since you people have a [[Stupid dwarf trick|tendency]] to drop [[magma]] on things." — [[Toady One]]
My imprisoned expedition leader just walked home while still considered a prisoner due to some erroneous travel code exclusive to position holders. — [[Toady One]]
If your vision of dwarves is less about crafting in the mountains, and more about a lone dwarf descending from the hills to attack a village with a pack of a dozen hounds, your vision is now a reality. That's how I tested it, anyway. Five of the dogs were struck down, but the humans will now think twice about whatever it was they were thinking about, that's for sure. — [[Toady One]]
Uzol had orders, though, and he followed them to the letter. He broke into the temple and brought me back the relic... now I guess I have a save if I want to test being invaded by angry humans. — [[Toady One]]
"...go to reclaim artifacts that were either stolen by kobolds or something, or maybe weren't yours to begin with, and you can be bad dwarves. Start some shit." — [[Toady One]]
Some uncommon situations have become hard to debug with a test adventurer, so world debug mode can now manifest the cursor as an adventurer. Lots of "Hello.  My name is Manifestation.  Why are you traveling?" today.  They don't notice the cursor human is clothing-free yet. — [[Toady One]]
I used my debug power to manifest as the Manifestation, holding the quest crossbow, which I immediately handed over. When I asked the quester about it, he said "An unknown creature has given an unknown creature <correct artifact name>. I don't care one way or another." — [[Toady One]]
Animals no longer become distracted from being unable to drink if they've experienced trauma, or from being unable to worship gods they shouldn't have been worshiping in the first place... — [[Toady One]]
Dropping a boulder on somebody and then leaving my dwarves unattended outside with nothing to do for a year resulted in tantrums, depression and oblivious wandering, so it seems to be working (...) I wasn't aware of their relationship status when the boulder fell; that's just how it turned out, sadly. — [[Toady One]]
Goblins are [[Immortality|meant to die]] violent deaths. — [[Toady One]]<sup>[http://www.bay12forums.com/smf/index.php?topic=1104.msg14899#msg14899]</sup>
I have some good saves I can look at and so forth, so hopefully I can pick some decent numbers if they are a problem, and if the numbers are fine, focus just on the ridiculous "scary teeth" part of it.  Although I guess teeth are scary sometimes, but it takes like a whole horror movie to build up to why, and these are just random troll teeth. — [[Toady One]]
Insurrections were such a problem in sites that I had to turn them off for your fortress's holdings; we'll get back to that later. It wasn't even the insurrections, really; the dwarves were bailing on the occupation immediately because they were afraid of insurrections. — [[Toady One]]
After producing three notable poems, Zicab was murdered by a goblin armorer in the pits (who was later devoured by a giant lion, so that has a happy ending.) — [[Toady One]]
Artuk soon gave up on fighting, and became a poet like her father and grandmother, moving again to the goblin pits, where apparently all poetry in this world is written. — [[Toady One]]
For instance, a human trading company called the Present Hall was wildly successful trading various leathers and bones for crafting, and eventually had enough clout to open a branch warehouse inside a dwarf fortress for the first time. Can't resist that [[draltha]] leather. — [[Toady One]]
This turned out to be a strategic error, as two short years later, a forgotten beast obliterated the fortress, the warehouse, and killed everyone inside. So, what's the correct response? Close the destroyed branch? No, no, you stimulate the (non-existent) economy by hiring local. Forgotten beast, you're the new (ruined) warehouse administrator, congratulations! — [[Toady One]]
I've mainly been 'consolidating gains' this week (that is, finding horrible bugs and wondering how anything worked in the first place.) — [[Toady One]]
He was imprisoned in a dwarf fortress for 20 years. He might have escaped, but a hydra came and ate him and everybody else. — [[Toady One]]
I did have to fix a bug where the human and dwarven allies also ate the dead if the elves led the attack. — [[Toady One]]
I'm not actually sure why he didn't try to start a zombie horde of his own instead, but this is okay. — [[Toady One]]
Necromancers can pet their zombie animals too, and the living can try too if they are foolish. Hmm, I think a necromancer might also be able to pet their zombie humanoids, due to how it does the detection. — [[Toady One]]
I went to a shrine, rolled a tin icosahedral die and it was a bad roll and I was cursed to be a snowy owl for a week. So I flew up to a nearby rooftop and pondered tangents. — [[Toady One]]
I intentionally accepted a petition to establish a temple for the ten worshippers from the Cult of Cats, and then ignored it for an entire year. The game announced that the agreement had been abandoned, and one of my fisherdwarves that belonged to the religion cancelled their job in dismay. — [[Toady One]]
Now-corrected highlights include the game getting confused about who owned the tomb after a mummy came back from the dead, leading to the mummy's zombies sieging themselves, and two dwarven spies diligently maintaining their enemy cover identities even when they came to live in the player's fort, confusing the local soldiers and starting civil wars. — [[Toady One]]
Fixed crash involving stressed out wilderness creatures wanting to complain to priests. — [[Toady One]]
Ha ha, {{token|MAJOR_CURSE|interaction}} occurs 13 times in the code, and was the first usage hint added. MAJOR_BLESSING does not occur. Poor dwarves. — [[Toady One]]
There was a [[23a:Magic#Remnants|brief moment]] in DF history where armor had hair, swords whistled and elf arrows exploded wooden spikes inside of people. Someday we'll get back [[Magic|there]]. It's scheduled! — [[Toady One]]
[[Giant rat]]s are classic beings, of course. We also have [[large rat]]s since it felt like there needed to be extra size gradations for ratdom. — [[Toady One]]
The [[platypus]] has poisonous spurs, as in real life, which can cause painful swelling. Perhaps your fortress would benefit by allowing a [[Platypus man|platypus person]] adventurer to become a resident [[monster slayer]]? — [[Toady One]]
Generally, the large monsters should be able to do larger things. Just squishing entire bodies, or even groups of dwarves all at once. Squish. — [[Toady One]]
”He he he.  Yeah, it almost looks done...  alas...  those who are in your teens, hold on until your twenties...  those in your twenties, your thirties...  others, cling to life as you are able... It should be pretty fun though.” — [[Tarn Adams]], [http://www.bay12forums.com/smf/index.php?topic=2525.msg40940#msg40940 2004]
The were-capybara is only one of the myriad lunatic monsters that terrorize the living. — [[ThreeToe]]
If I had to pick a bird to apply to this situation, it wouldn’t be the phoenix, because nothing exploded. — [[ThreeToe]][http://www.bay12forums.com/smf/index.php?topic=179293]
Everything is beginning to coalesce, to congeal, to coagulate. All that's left is the detritus that is required to bring us to the starting line, waiting for the crack of the pistol. What does that mean? It means that I took a creative writing class in college. — [[ThreeToe]] [http://www.bay12games.com/dwarves/#2022-07-15]
