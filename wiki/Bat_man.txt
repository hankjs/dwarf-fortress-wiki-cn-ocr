'''Bat men''' are humanoid versions of the common [[bat]] and are one of the many [[Creature|races]] of underground tribal [[animal people]] found living in small groups on any [[cavern]] level. They may also be found on the surface living in [[savage]] biomes, though these bat men will not live in tribes and will behave like the usual mindless animal people.

Despite being labelled as hostile in the unit list, bat men initially found in the caverns will ignore your citizens unless provoked. They will usually be observed carrying wooden [[spear]]s, [[blowgun]]s and [[shield]]s, although they are sometimes seen using metal items instead. These can range from [[copper]] to [[steel]], and are presumably caused by a bug. Depending on which other subterranean creatures they have access to, their [[blowdart]]s will be covered in different [[syndrome|poisons]], which can vary from mildly annoying [[cave spider]] venom to highly [[fun|dangerous]] [[giant cave spider]] toxins. You can preemptively check for poisons by selecting a [[blowgunner]], looking in their items tab and viewing their blowdarts.

Bat men may launch [[ambush|group attacks]] on your fort. When this happens, all tribesmen on the map will become hostile, even if they were peaceful minutes prior to the invasion. They may arrive with [[pet]]s and [[mount]]s, some of which will be able to fly or easily catch up to your fleeing civilians. These invaders, unlike their above-ground counterparts, will not leave after some time has passed, even if your fort is completely sealed off from the caverns, nor will they prevent migrants, caravans or other invaders from arriving; including more waves of bat men. Because of this, several unchallenged assaults from them can quickly cause your game's FPS to drop to single-digit levels, thus making your fort completely unplayable.

Bat men can fly, meaning that they will be able to fly over your walls, or through gaps in your floors and ceilings, so plan your defenses accordingly. It can also make them marginally harder to hit than other creatures their size.

Some [[dwarves]] [[Preferences|like]] bat men for their ''haunting cries''.

== Anatomy ==

Despite what their sprites might imply, bat men do not have separate arms and wings. A bat man's arms ''are'' their wings that they use to fly. They have a thumb and three other fingers attached to the hand of each arm/wing. Unlike bats, bat men do not have tails.

{{D for Dwarf}}

''Some things to watch out for when dealing with bat men:''
*They show a preference for working individually, paired up with a different bird man of some type or with [[nightwing]]s.
*They are most likely to target the dwarf whose "comedian" attribute is at the highest level.
*They are exceptional detectives: given enough preparation time, they can defeat any foe.
*Their default identities are a secret.  If you turn this off, their chasm will flood your fortress with human [[noble]]s instead.
*They can breathe in space.
*They are '''vengeance'''.  They are '''the night'''. 
*Their parents are DEEAAAAAAAD!!!
*Bat men '''DO NOT''' eat nachos. They prefer hotdogs instead.
*Bat men believe in the absolute sacredness of sapient life, and as such will never kill their enemies.

Urist McGordon Jr.: Why's he running, Dad?

Urist McGordon: Because we have to chase him.

Urist McGordon Jr.: He didn't do anything wrong.

Urist McGordon: Because he's the hero our Fortress deserves, but not the one it needs right now. So we'll hunt him. Because he can take it. Because he's not our hero. He's a silent guardian, a watchful protector. A dark [[champion]].

Now you will know why you fear the night. 

In the legendary tournament Splatterface, it is customary for fans to emit shrieking sounds for the sponsored and popular bat woman gladiator Shrieking Sounds. 

Possibly due to a bug, batmen will sometimes become stuck in a constant loop of crashing into an obstacle until [[war hammer|put]] [[steel|out]] [[short sword|of]] [[death|their]] [[fun|misery]]. The screeching cries of a batman stuck in a cycle of forever stubbing their toe has been known to drive dwarves to madness, with some [[drunk|scholars]] saying that if they were able to weaponize this power, they would be able to fend off a siege of [[demon|clowns]] a hundred times over.
