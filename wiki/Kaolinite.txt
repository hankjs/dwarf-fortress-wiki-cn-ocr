'''Kaolinite''' is a [[magma-safe]] pink-red [[stone]], much like [[bauxite]], found as large clusters in [[sedimentary layer]]s.  Kaolinite has a [[material value]] of 1 like most stone, but can be made into medium value [[porcelain]] goods at a [[kiln]] or [[magma kiln]].

[[Potter]]s ordered to make [[clay]] or ceramic goods will use the closest source of clay, fire clay, or kaolinite by default.  If you want to force your potters to use clay instead of more limited kaolinite, you could do one of two things: [[forbid]] all kaolinite through the [[Stocks]] menu, or set up a [[stockpile]] that either accepts only clay or that already has clay, and link the stockpile to the kiln.

==In real life ==

In the [[wikipedia:Kaolinite|real world]], Kaolinite is one of the most common minerals.  Being a clay mineral, Kaolinite clay occurs in abundance in [[soil|soils]] that have formed from the chemical weathering of rocks in hot, moist climates—for example in [[Forest|tropical rainforest]] areas.  While it is largely used in the production of paper, cosmetics and [[Soap|soaps]], it can also be used in [[farming]] in the form of a spray, so as to deter insect damage. Before the 21st century, it was widely used as an anti-diarrhea medication due to its absorbent properties.
