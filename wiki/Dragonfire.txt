'''Dragonfire''' [[File:dragonfire_preview_anim.gif|20px|]] is a very powerful form of [[fire]] that is produced by [[dragon]]s. 

==Characteristics==
[[File:Dragon's Breath Spanning Z-Levels.png|thumb|The dragonfire seen here was aimed at a dwarf 1 z-level below, and can be seen affecting both that z-level and the z-level above.]]
Dragonfire forms a rough cone shape from the dragon's front, with a range of approximately 20 tiles and a spread of 10 tiles{{cite talk|v0.34 Talk:Fire#Dragonfire}} which can span through up to two [[z-level]]s, igniting anything flammable caught in the radius. It can be told apart from common fire by its vibrant blue/purple color, though any fires it causes from contact with flammable objects will be the regular red color of flame.

Dragonfire can reach temperatures up to {{ct|50000}}. At that temperature, almost all materials should be destroyed. However, research has shown that dragonfire is quite particular about which objects it affects. When in a tile with dragonfire, organic materials will ignite, even including [[nether-cap]] [[wood]] with its fixed temperature. Non-flammable common [[stone]], [[glass]], and [[ceramic]] items will melt and boil away. Dragonfire is ineffective against [[water]], producing no [[steam]] or evaporation. [[Building]]s (but not [[construction]]s) are affected by dragonfire on their tile, making non-dragonfire-safe [[door]]s immune as long as they remain closed. Objects and buildings (and creatures) made out of [[slade]] are also immune to dragonfire, since the raws do not define a specific heat for slade, not that you can realistically build anything out of it in the first place.

Objects ignited by dragonfire drop to and continue to burn at their standard combustion temperature. However, repeated blasts of dragonfire can sustain much higher combustion temperatures, sufficient even to eventually melt nearby [[adamantine]].

==Defense==
Dragonfire can be extremely dangerous due to its wide spread potentially causing expansive fires in patches of [[grass]] or [[cave moss]] that may consume and melt [[Dwarf|dwarves]] in moments. The rate at which a dragon can breathe dragonfire is also rather quick, allowing the beast to continuously spam the attack so long as it is in combat.

Despite its powerfully destructive nature, dragonfire can be blocked by a simple [[shield]] better than 99% of the time, though this will do nothing to stop the surrounding flames from consuming the creature almost instantly if they are standing on flammable ground. Because of this, the best way to fight dragonfire is to confront the dragon while in non-flammable terrain such as stone; at this point, you just have to contend with the dragon, who may be a fierce opponent in its own right.

Dragonfire is powerful enough to burn and kill [[creature]]s who are immune to conventional fire, like [[fire imp]]s or [[magma crab]]s. The only creatures immune to dragonfire are dragons themselves (to keep them from killing themselves with their own breath), [[cave dragon]]s, and certain [[Demon|deep monsters]].

==Dragonfire-safe materials==
There are very few materials which can withstand the immense heat of dragonfire. Here is the full list:

*Dragonfire's temperature of {{ct|50000}} is the highest set temperature in the game. In comparison, it is hotter than the surface of the Sun, which is around {{ct|20000}}.
*Dragonfire is the highest temperature option that can be picked in the [[object testing arena]].
