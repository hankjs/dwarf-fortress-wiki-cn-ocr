'''Green tree frogs''' are unremarkable [[amphibious]] [[vermin]] found in [[temperate]] freshwater [[biome|biomes]]. They can be captured by [[trapper]]s and turned into low-value [[pet|pets]]. All green tree frogs possess Legendary [[skill]] in [[Climber|climbing]].

Despite the description, they do not live in trees. They will not appear in maps during the winter.

Some [[dwarves]] [[Preferences|like]] green tree frogs for their ''distinct mating call''.

{{D for Dwarf}}
Military dwarves may be expected to eat green tree frogs, if found in a deep trial to survive. This is in addition to going through the rain.
