'''Difficulty''' is the level of challenge presented by the game in [[Fortress Mode]], largely customizable by the player. These [[settings]] will affect whether your fortress can be attacked by outside forces, how frequent said attacks are, how big invading armies are, [[noble]] neediness, etc. You can modify these settings before and at any time after embarking, the tab will only appear in the settings screen when a [[fortress]] is loaded. Since they are specific to each save, they are stored as part of the save and are not editable outside the game.

== Default settings ==
They are divided into two groups: enemies and economy; enemies can be disabled, both groups have normal and hard presets, and all of the individual settings can be adjusted in Custom settings. The values used in each preset can be seen by selecting the preset and then viewing them in Custom settings.

'''Enemies''' has 3 options:
* '''Off''' will disable [[Ambush|ambushes]], [[Siege|sieges]], [[Megabeast|uninvited]] [[Forgotten beast|guests]], [[Werebeast|werebeasts]], and agitated wildlife attacks, but not [[intrigue]], [[HFS]], or misbehaving dwarves, so it is still recommended to train a military.
* '''Normal''' is the standard ''Dwarf Fortress'' experience.
* '''Hard''' ensures a never-ending stream of [[Fun]], causing invaders to show up earlier, more often, and with more bodies to throw at the gates.
----
'''Economy''' has 2 options:
* '''Normal''' is the standard ''Dwarf Fortress'' economy.
* '''Hard''' requires you to produce more wealth in order to receive higher-ranking nobles, requires [[Temple|temples]] and [[Guildhall|guildhalls]] to be more valuable before satisfying petitions, and causes [[Noble|nobles]] to make more [[Mandate|mandates]] and [[Demand|demands]].

If you wish, you can also fine-tune individual settings - maybe you only want megabeasts to assault your fortress, and would prefer the elves to leave well enough alone. The following options are available for enemy settings:
