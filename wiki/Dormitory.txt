'''Dormitories''' are a type of multiple-bed [[bedroom]], similar to [[barracks]]. Dormitories will primarily host civilians, though squad assigned dwarves will sleep in them when no other bed is available. A dormitory is designated via the zones menu.

To create a dormitory, first, open the {{menu icon|z}} Zones menu from the taskbar. Select Dormitory from the menu that appears. Then use the mouse to select the area you wish to become the dormitory. Finally, click accept. You may then redraw it, pause it, rename it, remove it or assign it to a [[location]]. Some players report (unconfirmed) that residents are not using dormitory beds even with no other option.{{verify}}  

Dormitories contribute less to happiness compared to [[bedroom]]s, but it is a good practice to have a dormitory available for newly arrived [[migrants]].
