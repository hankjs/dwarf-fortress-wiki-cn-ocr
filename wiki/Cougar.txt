'''Cougars''' are somewhat rare solitary large cats that live in shrub- and woodlands. Though equal in [[size]] to the average [[dwarf]], they'll rarely attack your dwarves, preferring instead to wander around far from your fortress. Cougars can be captured and trained by an [[animal trainer]]. While cougar parts are worth twice as much as [[domestic animal]] parts, it would be very difficult to establish a breeding program unless the [[elf|elves]] happen to bring a breeding pair. Unfortunately, unlike a lot of big cats they cannot receive war/hunting training (although this is easily remedied with some [[modding]]).

Some dwarves [[preferences|like]] cougars for their ''cunning''.

{{D for Dwarf}}
Later in the game, cougars might appear more frequently, depending on how many young male dwarves your fort has.
