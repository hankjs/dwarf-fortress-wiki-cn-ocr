[[File:organs_preview.png|right]]'''Prepared organs''' are edible butchering products. They can be [[kitchen|cooked]] into [[prepared meal]]s or [[food|eaten]] as is. Obviously enough, they are listed on the [[stocks]] menu under [[meat]]. Much like with meat, the amount of and distribution of prepared organs you will receive from a butchered [[creature]] depends on the size of the creature, both in relative terms (size relative to its species) and absolute ones (size, period).

The organs produced depend on the type of animal as given in the raws. Mutilated corpses will yield fewer organs depending upon what parts of the corpse are missing; if those parts can be found, they can be butchered as well.

All prepared organs have a [[Item value|base value]] of two. They are:

{{D for Dwarf}}

Contrary to what was once believed, most organisms will actually produce two whole pairs of lungs when butchered. How four lungs fit in one tiny dwarf body is a mystery only Armok knows.
