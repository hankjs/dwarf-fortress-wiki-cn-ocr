:''For the great beasts sometimes conflated with "bosses" in other games, see the articles on [[Megabeast]]s, [[Semi-megabeast]]s, [[Forgotten beast]]s, and [[Titan]]s, though be warned that they all contain minor spoilers.''

'''Bosses''' are the leaders of groups of [[criminal]]s, specifically leading criminal organizations or gangs of bandits. They may also be called a ringleader, master, warlord, chieftain, etc.

Criminal bosses can often be located in a [[dungeon]], while bandit leaders can be found in [[camp]]s. When you encounter them, they will be flashing like other leaders in the game. They are effectively treated as [[Quest#Commander|lords]] of their respective place of residence, meaning talking to a boss (if they haven't been provoked yet) will allow you to join them as a [[Hearthperson|lieutenant]], lay claim to their territory, etc. Bosses are often part of the [[intrigue]] system in some capacity.

Criminal leaders and their subordinates can occasionally be [[Combat skill|weapon masters]], and are often the only ones that are generated during [[world generation]]. Certain criminal bosses in capital cities will also come equipped with a random assortment of masterwork-quality items.
