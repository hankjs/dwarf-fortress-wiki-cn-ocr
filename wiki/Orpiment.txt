'''Orpiment''' is an unremarkable yellow [[stone]] found as small clusters in [[igneous extrusive]] layers. It is neither [[fire-safe]] nor [[magma-safe]], but has a beautiful amber color.

== In Real Life ==
Orpiment is an arsenic sulfide (as is [[realgar]]), and is extremely toxic in real life. It poses no health hazards in ''Dwarf Fortress'', however – dwarves can consume food and drink stored in orpiment pots without harm.<br>
