'''Kiwis''' are small flightless [[Creature|birds]] who can be found in [[temperate]] [[forest]]s and [[shrubland]]s, where they spawn individually. Benign and only half the size of a [[cat]], they do nothing but root around the ground, eating [[vermin]] and fleeing from [[dwarves]] who try and [[Ambusher|hunt]] them. A male kiwi is called a ''kiwi cock'', while a female is called a ''kiwi hen''.

Kiwis can be captured in [[cage]] [[trap]]s and [[Animal trainer|trained]] into cheap exotic [[pet]]s. They produce a tiny amount of returns when [[butcher]]ed and only lay up to 2 [[egg]]s at a time, making them poor choices for livestock. However, they are fairly long lived for wild animals, making them potentially long-lasting companions for dwarves who adopt them.

Some dwarves [[Preferences|like]] kiwis for their ''long beaks''.

{{D for Dwarf}}
Some [[Dwarf|dwarves]] like to [[Decoration|engrave]] [[Bin|boxes]] with this bird and put stimulating toys inside for [[Children|young dwarves]] to occupy themselves with.
<!-- Reference: New Zealand -->
Contrary to popular belief, Kiwis do not only appear on small, remote, [[Island|Islands]].
