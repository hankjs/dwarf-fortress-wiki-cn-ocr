A '''short sword''' is an [[attack types|edged]] [[weapon]] larger than a knife, with a blade long enough to make slashing effective, but shorter than [[long sword|other swords]]. Short swords have the same basic attacks as other swords, but suffer slightly because of their reduced size. As with all edged weapons, metals with good edge properties are most effective.

==Properties==
Short swords use and train the [[swordsman]] skill (called "Swordsdwarf" in dwarf mode). They have stabbing and slashing attacks, along with a blunt pommel strike. Swords can be useful for dealing with all kinds of foes, although they're not as good at any of these attacks as more specialized weapons. 

==Fortress mode==
Dwarves can [[forge]] short swords out of any weapon-grade [[metal]], but those with [[material science|superior edge properties]] are more effective. "Rock short swords" are a special type of short sword that are constructed out of [[obsidian]] (with [[wood]]en handles) by a [[stonecrafter]] at a [[craftsdwarf's workshop]]. Rock short swords may be based on the Aztec [[wikipedia:Macuahuitl|Macuahuitl]], described as being a club with rows of sharp stone edges affixed to the sides. All dwarves can equip short swords, but [[Weapon#Size|a tiny fraction must use two hands]].

=== Forging and Melting ===
* Metal short swords cost '''one''' [[metal]] bar to [[forge]], or '''three''' [[adamantine]] wafers.
* When a non-adamantine metal short sword is [[melt|melted down]], it will return '''0.9''' metal bars, for an '''efficiency of 90%'''.
* When an adamantine short sword is melted down, it will produce '''0.9''' wafers, for an '''efficiency of 30%'''

==Adventurer mode==
As an adventurer, it is possible to play as a swordsman. If you're an elf or a dwarf, a short sword is a good all-round weapon. which can be used successfully on a wide variety of foes, but is most effective against lightly armoured creatures. Generally, it's best to ''slash'' when fighting relatively small unarmoured foes (goblins, kobolds, and humans for example), and to ''stab'' larger unarmoured foes, such as megabeasts. Short swords are a fine choice against heavily-armoured foes, too; stabbing is strictly better than pommel striking due to the low contact area, so it should be ignored.
