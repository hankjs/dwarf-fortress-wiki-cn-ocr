In the [[Noble|Nobles and administrators]] {{menu icon|n}}, by clicking on the crown+ icon next to a relevant position, available objects in your fortress can be made into a symbol of a [[noble|noble or administrative]] position. If multiple objects are assigned to a position or a [[Citizenship|citizen]] is assigned to more than one position with an assigned symbol, they will try and equip them all.

When a new object is assigned as a symbol, unless it is already an [[artifact]] or [[named objects|named object]], you will have the opportunity to choose a [[Names_and_symbols#Custom names|custom name]] for the object or accept the default name generated by the game. As this also makes them a [[named objects|named object]], items that have been designated as a symbol of office will count as artifacts for [[stockpile]] storage quality settings and they cease to gain wear levels or dull but it remains uncertain whether or not they gain the other bonuses that [[artifact]] [[Weapon|weapons]] and [[armor]] have.
