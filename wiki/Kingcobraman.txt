'''King cobra men''' are [[animal people]] variants of the common [[king cobra]] who inhabit [[tropical]] [[forest]]s. They spawn in groups of 1-5 individuals and are generally content to keep to themselves. In terms of size, they are a little over half the weight of the average [[dwarf]].

Like other savage animal people, king cobra men can join [[civilization]]s, become [[historical figure]]s, appear as [[visitor]]s and be playable in [[adventurer mode]].

Some dwarves [[Preferences|like]] king cobra men for their ''charming hood''.
