'''Basking sharks''' are massive [[Creature|sharks]] who inhabit [[temperate]] [[ocean]]s. They are among the [[List of creatures by adult size#end of list|largest creatures]] in the game and are the second largest of all fish, losing only to the [[whale shark]]. Huge as they are, they are benign and harmless to [[dwarves]], who are more likely to drown by being on water rather than being attacked by one of these. An infant basking shark is called a ''basking shark pup''.

Being non-vermin fish, [[Fisherdwarf|fisherdwarves]] can't fish basking sharks, but they can be caught in [[drowning chamber]]s and [[butcher]]ed for an immense amount of returns. As [[Cartilage|cartilaginous]] fish, butchered basking sharks won't provide you with [[bone]]s, though you'll still get a [[skull]] from them.

Some dwarves [[Preferences|like]] basking sharks for their ''giant open mouths''.
