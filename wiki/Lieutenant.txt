'''Lieutenant''' is a position in the mostly unrealized civilization-wide dwarven army. A lieutenant is appointed and commanded by the [[General]]. Lieutenants command [[Captain]]s. If they were present at the fortress, they could lead a squad of ten.
They are not appointed in civilization creation, because their Position_token NUMBER is not fixed, it is AS_NEEDED. This means that they are only then created when they are needed, and those circumstanses are very rare.
