'''Lizard men''' are humanoid versions of the common [[lizard]] and a [[Creature|species]] of unremarkable [[animal people]], found in many [[savage]] [[biome]]s. They are a little over half the size of [[dwarf|dwarves]] when adults and spawn in groups of 1-3 individuals. They should pose no threat unless provoked. All lizard men are born with Legendary [[skill]] in [[Climber|climbing]].

Like other savage animal people, lizard men may occasionally join [[civilization]]s, becoming full-fledged citizens who may appear in your fortress as [[visitor]]s or be playable in [[adventurer mode]].

Some dwarves [[Preferences|like]] lizard men for their ''beauty''.

Some lizard women admire [[Cave fish man|cave fish women]] for their sheer awesomeness, although they are unable to express it because of their natural timidness. They are also rumored to be connected to the origin of [[Forgotten beast|forgotten beasts]], which puts even further strain on their fragile psyche.

Human peasants have been occasionally witnessed accusing their local lords of being lizard men, but all such allegations have been proven to be false.

Some lizard women [[Tavern_keeper|tavern keepers]] are rumored to be master [[Cook|bakers]] and can even repair [[Wear|xxsteel spearxx]].
