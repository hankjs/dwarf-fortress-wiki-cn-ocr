'''Giant opossums''' are larger versions of the standard [[opossum]]. They can be somewhat dangerous to an unarmed dwarf, though they should pose little threat to even a fledgling [[military]]. 

Giant opossums can be [[animal trainer|tamed]] as [[pet]]s, or bred as livestock for a [[meat industry]], though their lifespan of 2-4 years significantly limits their usefulness. They provide a medium amount of meat, but other, larger "giant" animals provide better [[butcher]]ing returns. Therefore, giant opossums are little more than pests to most fortresses, but they can be useful as wild [[hunter|hunting]] targets.

Some dwarves [[preference|like]] giant opossums for their ''ability to play dead''.

{{D for Dwarf}}
Some dwarven scholars consider these creatures to be a probable origin of the elven worship of nature, postulating that, due to the peculiar appearance of these animals, they might have mistaken the opossums for moving walls powered by divine will.
