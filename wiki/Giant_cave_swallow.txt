'''Giant cave swallows''' are the much larger cousins of the common [[cave swallow]], who are a quite common sight at the first and second layer of the [[caverns]]. Nearly as big as [[troll]]s, these birds appear individually and will meander the underground aimlessly, and despite being carnivorous, they are benign and will rarely fight back if provoked by [[Dwarf|dwarves]], making them easy prey for your [[Crossbowman|marksdwarves]].

Giant cave swallows can be captured in [[cage]] [[trap]]s and [[Animal trainer|trained]] into valuable [[pet]]s. They can further be trained into hunting beasts (but not war ones) and assigned to your [[hunter]]s, where their great size will really shine. The birds can also be put on a [[nest box]] for them to lay a meager amount of [[egg]]s or simply [[butcher]]ed for a nice quantity of returns - products made from giant cave swallows are [[Item value|worth]] twice as much as those made from common animals. Giant cave swallows are exotic [[mount]]s and may be used by [[goblin]]s during [[siege]]s, allowing them to fly over any [[moat]] or similar obstacle put between them and your fortress.

Some dwarves [[Preferences|like]] giant cave swallows for their ''coloration''.
