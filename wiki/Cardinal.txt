'''Cardinals''' are a type of [[vermin]] found in any [[temperate]] area that has [[tree]]s. They may be captured in [[animal trap]]s and turned into [[pet]]s. All cardinals possess Legendary [[skill]] in [[Climber|climbing]].

Some dwarves [[Preferences|like]] cardinals  for their ''coloration''.

{{D for Dwarf}}
Cardinals are [[building destroyer]]s known for their angry temper and a deep hatred towards [[pig]]s, and will lay [[siege]]s to your fortress once the pig population is high enough.
