'''Monarch butterfly men''' are [[animal people]] variants of the common [[monarch butterfly]], who can inhabit most [[savage]] [[biome]]s. They spawn in groups of 2-5 individuals and are generally content to keep to themselves, but may pick fights if provoked. In terms of size, they are a little over half the weight of the average [[dwarf]]. All monarch butterfly men are born with Legendary [[skill]] in [[Climber|climbing]].

Like other savage animal people, monarch butterfly men can join [[civilization]]s, become [[historical figure]]s, appear as [[visitor]]s and be playable in [[adventurer mode]].

Some dwarves [[Preferences|like]] monarch butterfly men for their ''coloration''.

{{D for Dwarf}}
A monarch butterfly man and his army of butterfly men have been spotted obsessively antagonizing a (self-proclaimed) super-genius scholar dwarf and his two sons, however, he is always stopped by their blond muscular bodyguard. It is said the butterfly man and his minions fly around in a flying giant cocoon that has no obvious means of propulsion.
