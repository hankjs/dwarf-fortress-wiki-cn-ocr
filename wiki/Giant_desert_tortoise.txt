'''Giant desert tortoises''' are enlarged [[Creature|cousins]] of the common [[desert tortoise]], found in [[savage]] [[desert]] [[biome]]s. They are far larger than a [[dwarf]], about as heavy as a [[tiger]], but rarely pose any threat to a fortress; like normal tortoises, they are benign and will flee from attackers. They are one of the few sources of [[shell]]s in deserts, and the only one when there's no [[water]] available.

Giant desert tortoises can be captured in [[cage]] [[trap]]s and trained into pets, possessing the standard value of giant creatures. They produce far more returns when [[butcher]]ed than their normal counterparts, but aren't any better at [[egg]]-laying. Like normal tortoises, they are very long-lived and serve as good long-term pets for dwarves who adopt them.

Some dwarves [[Preferences|like]] giant desert tortoises for their ''shells'' and their ''longevity''.
