'''King of Beasts''' is a fan title originally awarded to elephants for their brutality and strength. While elephants are no longer the beasts they were, there are currently quite a few contenders for the title.

== Water ==

[[Giant sponge]]: These horrifying monsters can only be killed in fair combat by mashing their bodies to a pulp, a feat that generally requires lots of patience and a gigantic hammer. They are not very aggressive, but Armok help you if you are next to them in water.

[[Giant sperm whale]]: Gigantic beyond all comparison, this creature is large enough to absorb an unbelievable amount of punishment and smash its way through nearly any amount of armor or natural durability with its mass alone.

== Air ==

[[Giant kea]]: These brutal, green giant parrots have the distinction of looking harmless, but not only will they seek your fort for stealing stuff (such as your sole anvil, when you have not built your forge yet), but also tend to brutally murder any dwarf they meet in the dark corridors of your fort.

[[Giant mosquito]]: Before they were nerfed, they attacked in ''hundreds'', overwhelming dwarwes with sheer numbers and lagging the game if too much of them are on the map at the same time. Now are nowhere near as powerful.

== Land ==

[[Unicorn]]: Their main definition of '[[good]]' is living in a fairyland full of [[feather tree]]s while stabbing and kicking dwarves to death, which is bad news when they're bigger than a horse and have hooves.  [[Elves]] can bring a ton of them with their sieges.

[[Giant cave spider]]: This large arachnid will eat most stuff in the caverns, including most dwarves you throw at them.  It can shoot immobilising webs and injects a deadly toxin, making it incredibly dangerous.

[[Cave dragon]]: Cave dragons are as skilled in battle as your regular soldiers, if not more, and are ''far'' larger than them. The [[fun]] news? They come by the dozens with [[goblin]] [[sieges]]!

[[Giant dingo]]: A hell-spawned monster, the giant dingo not only is bigger, faster, and more aggressive than a bear, but it spawns in groups and is native to every savage biome. Few adventurers (or babies) will survive.

[[Giant elephant]]: A giant [[elephant]]. It is the biggest land creature and second-biggest creature, tied with [[giant orca|giant orcas]]. Since they're "War Animals", "Hunting Animals" and "Exotic Mounts", they can also be fielded during [[elf]], [[human]] and [[dwarf]] [[sieges]]!

[[Elephant man]]: Massive humanoids who can wear armor and use weapons. They are the biggest sapient land animal person - and '''the''' biggest sapient that is not a megabeast or semi-megabeast. You can play them in Adventure Mode - [[Stupid_dwarf_trick#Elephant_man_armor_factory|armor and clothes are made separately]]. And they sometimes come with [[sieges]]!
