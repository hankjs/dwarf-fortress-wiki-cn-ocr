[[File:Oliven_V1.jpg|thumb|250px|right|Olive oil is unusual in that it is pressed from the whole olive fruit, rather than from oil-bearing seeds.]]
'''Oil''' is an ingredient in [[cooking]] and [[soap]] making, made by [[pressing]] one of the several [[seed]] pastes or fruit at a [[screw press]]. The press squeezes the material, releasing the oil, which is stored in a [[liquid]]-capable [[jug]].  The oil can then be used to supplement a fortress's [[food]] supply, or can be combined with [[lye]] to make [[soap]].

== Oil-producing crops ==

The following crops produce seeds that can be milled and pressed into oil:

{| class="wikitable" cellspacing="0" border="1" cellpadding="5"|-

! Oil Name
! Oil Value|-|[[Quarry bush]]|Yes|Rock Nut oil|5☼|-|[[Cotton]]|No|Cottonseed oil|5☼|-|[[Flax]]|No|Linseed oil|5☼|-|[[Hemp]]|No|Hempseed oil|5☼|-|[[Kenaf]]|No|Kenaf seed oil|5☼|-|[[Olive]] (fruit)|No|Olive oil|5☼|}

== Value ==
Oil will be used in the [[kitchen]] when 'prepare meal' tasks are queued if it is enabled in the [[Labor#Kitchen|Kitchen tab]] in the Labor menu {{menu icon|y}}. 

Most of the seeds can be cooked directly, but have a base value of 1☼.  However, [[milling]] the seeds to a paste and pressing them into oil generates a [[press cake]] with a value of 1☼ and a unit of oil with a value of 5☼, a 500% value increase for only two [[labor]]s. 

== Bugs ==

Cooks will only cook oil and other fluids as a last resort, instead preferring to cook solid foods with solid foods. {{Bug|2393}} For more information, see the [[Kitchen#Bugs|kitchen]] page.
