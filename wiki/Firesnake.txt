'''Fire snakes''' are [[fire-safe|fire-proof]] [[vermin]] made entirely out of [[fire]]. They spawn only around [[magma]] sites, which are defined as the original [[biome]]s, and don't include any [[channel]]s that carry magma away from magma pipes or magma pools. They may start fires, so locating [[fuel]] or [[graphite]] [[stockpile|stockpiles]] near magma (or passages leading to magma) is risky. They will also inspire an unhappy [[thought]] if a [[dwarf]] that [[Hateable|hates]] them encounters one.

With a body temperature of {{ct|14000}}, a fire snake is hotter than magma and hotter than the melting point of nearly all [[magma-safe]] materials. It can melt or burn its way out of nearly any [[animal trap]] (even [[nether-cap]], though the trap remains unharmed), with the exception of [[adamantine]]. Fortunately, like most other vermin, a [[cat]] will handily kill them, especially if pastured in the area of the infestation.

Although fire snakes spawn near magma, a dwarf on trapping duty can unwittingly transport a fire snake to an animal stockpile elsewhere in your fortress. Once set down by the [[trapper]], a fire snake's high temperature can destroy the animal trap that holds it. Once free, a fire snake can cause all sorts of [[fun]] with your loose objects, including the destruction of [[Item quality|masterworks]], leading to unhappy thoughts in their creators, and [[cage]]s, releasing any creatures held therein.

As vermin, fire snakes don't "spit" any sort of fire - the only thing they do is destroy wooden items that they 'step' on.

An artifact made from a fire snake's vermin remains, which can be produced only during a macabre [[strange mood]], will inherit the static temperature property of the fire snake. This will result in high levels of !![[fun]]!! for any thieving [[kea]] or [[kobolds]] who attempt to make off with a fort's spicy new treasure. Similarly, this same !![[fun]]!! will also apply to any dwarves who attempt to wear it.  

[[Liquid fire]] is a valuable [[extracts|extract]] derived from captured fire snakes.

Some dwarves [[Preferences|like]] fire snakes for their ''mystery''.
