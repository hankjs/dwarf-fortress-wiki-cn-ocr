'''Shortfin mako sharks''' are [[Cartilage|cartilaginous]] [[Creature#Aquatic|fish]] that can be found in [[temperate]] and [[tropical]] [[ocean]]s. Slightly larger than the average [[dwarf]], they provide a fair amount of [[meat]] when [[butcher]]ed. As fully-sized creatures, they can't be fished by [[Fisherdwarf|fisherdwarves]], but can be caught with a [[drowning chamber]]. An infant shortfin mako shark is called a ''shortfin mako shark pup''.

Being cartilaginous, shortfin mako sharks won't give [[bone]]s if butchered (though they'll still provide a [[skull]]).

Some dwarves [[Preferences|like]] shortfin mako sharks for their ''speed''.
