'''Iguanas''' are small exotic [[Creature|reptiles]] found in all [[tropical]] [[forest]]s. They are relatively rare and are solitary, only spawning one at a time. Despite their description, they are carnivorous, but due to being roughly the size of [[cat]]s, they rarely present any danger to a [[dwarf]]. Likewise, they cannot actually attack with their tails.

Iguanas possess a respectable pet value for a creature of their size, making them valuable [[pet]]s. Additionally, they lay between 40 to 50 [[egg]]s at a time, being the second most egg-laying non-[[vermin]] creature found in the surface after the [[saltwater crocodile]], which makes them excellent for [[egg production]]. [[Elf|Elven]] [[caravan]]s may bring tame iguanas with them, which serves as an easy way of acquiring the creatures. In case you capture a pair of opposite sexes, be wary that breeding them will inevitably lead to an [[Catsplosion#Iguanasplosion|iguanasplosion]] which may be harmful to your [[Frames per second|FPS]].

Some dwarves like iguanas for their ''dewlaps'' and their ''head bobs''.
