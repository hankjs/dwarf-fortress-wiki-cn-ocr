'''Orthoclase''' is a common, chestnut-colored [[stone]], which conveniently happens to be [[magma-safe]]. Along with [[microcline]], it is one of the most common types of stone that most players will encounter.

==In Real Life==
Orthoclase, a potassium-aluminum silicate, is an Alkali feldspar mineral that forms in relatively moderate temperature for an igneous mineral, between 500 and 900 degrees centigrade. Orthoclase's chemical formula is identical to that of [[Microcline]] (KAlSi<sub>3</sub>O<sub>8</sub>), but microcline forms at lower temperatures (usually below 400 degrees Celsius). Gem-quality orthoclase is one of two minerals that are called [[Moonstone]].
