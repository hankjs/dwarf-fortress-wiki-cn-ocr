There are two types of '''Camel''' in Dwarf Fortress  - [[one-humped camel|one-humped]] and [[two-humped camel|two-humped]] varieties. See these articles for more information on these beasts.

One of the more ludicrous debates in [[Main:Dwarf Fortress|Dwarf Fortress]] is as to which type of camel is more dangerous: the one-humped or two-humped variety?
The technical answer is simple:
A weapon will hit a random body part; a one humped camel has fewer body parts (lacking the second hump) and hence it will be marginally easier to score a lethal hit on a one humped camel rather than the two-humped variety.

Once genetics and breeding and magic get in, however, we can start to see artificial selection for even more dangerous camels:
:''"In 2342, the wizard Arkanadir Morlavator developed a new race: the dreaded three-humped camel. This quickly set off a cascade of imitators, and it wasn't 2 years later that the 4-humped camel was produced. A competition, at first friendly but later becoming ferocious came about to develop the camel with the most humps. This finally ending in 2478 with Mogaria Fornenzon's development of the limbless, headless 18-humped camel which died immediately upon birth, upon which event everyone decided breeding camels with ridiculous numbers of humps was a stupid idea. The number-of-limbs-on-a-[[Giant cave spider|GCS]] was the next contest devised, but that competition was an utter disaster which led to the wholesale slaughter of the wizards, and the rise of the fourth age."''

And this, my friends, is why GCS's have 8 legs.
