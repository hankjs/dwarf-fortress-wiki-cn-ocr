[[Dwarves]] with the '''food hauling''' [[labor]] enabled (default) will participate in hauling food and drink items (including [[lye]], for some reason) to appropriate food [[stockpile]]s. Note that certain instances of food hauling do '''not''' require this labor, notably returning alcohol barrels to stockpiles after taking a drink (if the barrel wasn't originally on a stockpile and a new spot has just opened up) and storing plants after [[herbalist|gathering]] or [[grower|harvesting]] them.

See [[Hauling]] for more information.
