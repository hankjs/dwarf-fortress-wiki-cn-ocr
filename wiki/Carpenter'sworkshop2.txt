A '''carpenter's workshop''' is a [[Workshop#Tier_1_Workshops|Tier 1]] [[workshop]] used by a [[carpenter]] to make most types of [[furniture]], with the exception of [[statue]]s. The workshop can also make wooden [[block]]s or items like [[bucket]]s, [[crutch]]es, [[shield]]s, and [[training weapon]]s. [[Bed]]s can only be made at a carpenter's workshop.

The carpenter's workshop can be built from any building material, and must be built by a [[dwarf]] with the Carpentry [[labor]] enabled.

<!-- ==Adventure Mode==
As of version 43.01, carpenter's workshops can be constructed using the build menu. Standing in its space adds the relevant options to the crafting menu, each item consumes one log, and a sharp item is required as a tool (same as adventure mode bonecrafting). The following items can be made this way:

*Chairs
*Tables
*Beds
*Chests
*Cabinets
*Doors
*Barrels
*Buckets
*Caskets
*Hatch covers
*Grates
*Bins
*Stepladders (used by pressing ({{K|h}}) when dropped)
*Bookcases
*Splints
*Crutches
*Shields
*Bucklers
*Training axes
*Training short swords
*Training spears

Of these items, chests are the only furniture that cannot be placed using the build menu. Additionally, splints are not usable in adventure mode.-->
