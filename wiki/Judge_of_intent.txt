'''Judge of intent''' is a [[social skill]] used by dwarves while chattering amongst themselves and avoiding work. This is an important [[broker]] skill, as it allows the broker to tell how a trader feels about a particular deal. The [[sheriff]] and [[captain of the guard]] also use this skill when [[intrigue|interrogating]] suspects. You can quickly improve this skill interrogating the same person on different cases (or different persons on the same case).

If your broker is Novice or better in this skill, you will get messages about your trading partner's willingness to trade (see [[Trade#Merchant_mood|"merchant mood"]]). It is possible for a dwarf who starts with Novice skill to become rusty by the time the dwarven caravan arrives, but a single small trade will remove the rust and allow the trader's mood to be gauged.

To train this skill, let dwarves idle and chatter amongst themselves. However, with the personality changes in v0.40, this may or may not be as effective as before.
In [[adventure mode]], this skill is trained when someone gives you a compliment. It is also trained (along with [[persuader]]) any time you state your values in conversation and, having encountered disagreement, press the argument. Note that it is ''only'' raised when the other party disagrees with your belief — unlike persuader, which will be raised whether or not the other party is convinced, judge of intent will only be raised if they express disagreement. This means that once your persuader skill is high enough, it will become much more difficult to raise judge of intent, as most NPCs will immediately change their opinion to yours when you state your values, and debate will not be possible.
