[[File:v50_labyrinth.png|thumb|170px|right|The minotaur knows the turns better than you.]]'''Labyrinth''' ([[File:icon_site_labyrinth.png]] / {{Raw Tile|#|0:7:0}}) is a type of [[site]], functioning identically to a [[lair]]. It consists of narrow [[tunnel]]s and a [[treasure room]]. Each labyrinth is home to a [[minotaur]], who will aggressively defend the treasures.

A labyrinth can be discovered in [[adventurer mode]] either by travelling or by asking local people about the beasts. As you explore the labyrinth, the Minotaur will taunt you ('I'll grind your bones into porridge!' 'I'll eat you whole!') until you find and kill it - or it kills you.

Labyrinths can have multiple z-levels.
