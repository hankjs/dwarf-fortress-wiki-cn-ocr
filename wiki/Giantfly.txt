'''Giant flies''' are the much larger [[Creature|cousins]] of the common [[fly]], found in just about every [[savage]] biome, but mountains, glacier and tundra. They are also supposed to appear in savage [[pool]]s, but as non-[[vermin]] can't spawn in pools, this never happens. Over three times bigger than a [[dwarf]], these insects aren't benign and will defend themselves if provoked. They lack any sort of offensive attack and rely on [[push]]es for self-defense; however, they are large enough to potentially injure a dwarf with such attacks. Additionally, they also can use their wings for wrestling, potentially leading to the absurd circumstance of a dwarf getting throttled to death by overgrown vermin. All giant flies are born full-sized adults, and with Legendary [[skill]] in [[Climber|climbing]]. 

Giant flies can be captured in [[cage]] [[trap]]s and [[Animal trainer|trained]] into [[pet]]s, possessing the standard high value of giant creatures. Keeping giant flies as long-term fortress pets isn't a good idea, however, due to their exceptionally short lifespan - they only live for one measly year. Any dwarf who adopts them as pets will find them dying very quickly, and their lifespans are too short for a giant fly farm to be viable. The player should instead consider [[butcher]]ing them for [[food]] and [[fat]] while they can. Giant flies are exotic [[mount]]s and can be ridden by [[Elf|elves]] during [[siege]]s.

Some dwarves [[Preferences|like]] giant flies for their ''ability to annoy''.
