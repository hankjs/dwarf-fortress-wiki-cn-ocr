'''Minks''' are tiny [[creature]]s who can be found in [[temperate]] [[lake]]s and [[river]]s. They are solitary, appearing only one at a time. They're benign and only marginally larger than the average [[Cat|kitten]], making them entirely harmless. A newborn mink is called a ''mink kit''.

Minks can be captured in [[cage]] [[trap]]s and [[Animal trainer|trained]] into exotic [[pet]]s. Their tiny size means they can't be [[butcher]]ed if hunted, and slaughtered tame ones will only give a [[skull]] in return.

Some [[Dwarf|dwarves]] [[Preferences|like]] minks for their ''long bodies''.
