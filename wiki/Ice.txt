'''Ice''' is [[water]] that has been frozen by cold seasons. Any water that is [[above ground]] will freeze during the cold time, but it will stay wet if it is on [[subterranean]] tiles.

A tile of water with a depth of 1-3 will freeze to create an '''ice floor''' (which will eventually melt to yield the same level of water). A water tile with a depth of 4 or more will freeze into an '''ice wall''' and will additionally create an ice floor one [[Z-level]] above it (which will ''not'' leave any extra water when it melts). The ice wall will be the same no matter how deep the water is. As there is no thin ice, the floor can be walked on freely. Ice walls can be [[mine]]d like any other natural wall. The ice wall will melt into water of depth 7 when warmer temperatures arrive, which can keep ponds full if rain only fills them up to 2/7. If an ice floor is [[smoothed]], it will yield 2 water when it melts.

Ice walls can be mined out, creating [[Ice#Ice as a stone|boulders]] of ice that melt into thin air come spring. This makes winter an ideal time to get rid of any [[lake]]s that are in the way.

Entire water supplies can become completely frozen upon winter in colder areas. This can depopulate an entire fortress with rapidity in the first winter if they're unprepared. To counter this, make a [[cistern]] inside beforehand or brew enough [[alcohol]].

== Ice as a stone ==

Ice appears as a light blue stone which can be found by mining through an ice wall.  Ice boulders and objects made of ice will melt after some time when exposed to warmer temperatures (such as [[Subterranean|below ground]]), giving it rather limited use; ice boulders can even melt while being carried by your dwarves, causing them to drop the item and resulting in a smear of water on the floor beneath them.

It is possible to build [[construction|constructions]] out of ice, even underground (provided your dwarves move quickly enough to finish construction before the ice melts). These constructions are then stable even as temperature rises. Pillars of ice walls can even be built within rooms that are later flooded with [[magma]] (though the walls become "warm", they will not melt, due to constructions not currently being able to melt and/or burn{{cite|dev page|http://www.bay12games.com/dwarves/dev.html}}).

Attempts to build underground [[workshop|workshops]], paved roads, or other non-construction [[building|buildings]] out of ice will usually result in the ice melting immediately, the message "The dwarves were unable to complete the [workshop_name]", and the workshop construction being canceled completely. Ice buildings can be constructed aboveground during freezing weather, though they will melt during the spring/summer thaw, or if their central tile is warmed (e.g. by fresh homeotherm [[corpse]]s in an ice [[butcher's shop]]). 

Ice cannot be used to craft, nor is it possible to create [[door]]s, [[hatch]]es, and other crafts from it.

The game refers to ice boulders as "ice".  It does not appear in any stockpile options or via the manager, so it cannot be moved by designating a stockpile, but only by [[dump]]ing it. Alternatively, and probably much faster, simply designate a [[construction]], such as a wall, to be built underground with the ice blocks, and then later deconstruct it at your leisure (assuming the area remains cold enough). 

Melted ice boulders cannot be used as a water source.

A boulder of ice is worth 3☼ if traded, and weighs 92Γ.

== Casting ice ==
[[File:ice_v50_preview.png|thumb|150px|right|Ice in the premium version.]]
[[File:Icebridge.png|right|thumb|An ice bridge cast in place across a chasm, in ASCII mode.]]
Only one fill pond job will be created for each pond zone, so multiple pond zones will speed up casting. These additional zones can simply overlap each other, or you can separate them into distinct areas, such as a series of 10×1 zones. Once any pond zone is completely cast, you will start getting cancellation notifications that they cannot fill the pond. At that point, you can just delete the zone and the fill pond job goes away on its own.

The first layer of cast ice requires two buckets of water per tile: the first bucket makes an ice floor on the layer below, while the second bucket makes an ice wall on the lower layer and an ice floor on the level above. Subsequent layers require only one bucket per tile (since the ice floor already exists).

Make your water source as close as possible to the construction site. It needs to be underground so it doesn't freeze, but closer means things get cast from ice more quickly.

Water in buckets will last for a surprisingly long time before freezing in the bucket as a chunk of ice - it's really not an issue unless the bucket is dropped and left outside. If the bucketful of water does freeze, just order the ice to be dumped, and the chunks of ice will be taken to your garbage zone. Note that this is affected by the temperature &mdash; for example, water in buckets in a glacier [[biome]] will freeze much more quickly than if the same water and buckets are in a cold temperate biome.

Put your bucket stockpile right next to the water source, and produce a large number of buckets to ensure there is always another bucket to be filled.

You can cast ice over a ledge. First the ice floor, and then the ice wall, is cast at the Z-level right below the pond zone. This means if you're dumping buckets of water off of a 2 Z-level high wall, you will be forming a solid ice roof and the area underneath will be completely ice free, and even safe to walk over as the ice is being cast over their heads.

Cast ice may "float" entirely unsupported for an extended length of time, however, it will eventually [[cave-in]] when support is checked.

You can cast ice walls on the edge of the map, however the edge tiles can only be cleared of ice by melting. The effects on creatures spawning there are unknown.

== Freezing, thawing, and dying ==
If water freezes, any creature on the water tile will be cast in ice and die instantly. This also applies if the tile has only 1/7 water on it and would otherwise be completely safe to walk on. At least the body can be retrieved by mining the ice block. 

Due to the intricacies of dwarven physics, ice can be a [[fun|formidable enemy]], particularly on maps that thaw in stages: If you have shallow surface water, for instance remnants of a drained murky pool, all the 1/7 water will freeze into ice walls. Once spring approaches, the ice walls will melt into 7/7 water. The water will scatter into the surroundings, filling tiles with 1/7 water. About half of the water will soon freeze again into damp ice walls, and then thaw again into 7/7 water. This process can flood and freeze a significant part of the surface, creating conditions much worse than a [[siege]].

If a frozen [[murky pool]] thaws, it will also do so instantly.  Any dwarf standing on the ice will plunge into the water and drown (unless they have Adequate or better [[swimming]] skill, the fall will [[status icon|stun]] them).  To reduce the chance of this happening, you can use [[traffic]] designations: mark the ice as restricted, and put a high traffic ring around the perimeter of the pool.  Or, if you don't need to [[fish]] from it, you can [[construction|construct]] a [[wall]] around it or a [[floor]] over it.

Running magma under unmined ice will melt it. This appears to be the best way to turn large amounts of ice into water to use as a water source, when all you have is ice and magma.

Creatures that are extremely hot, such as [[Magma man|magma men]], will melt unmined ice around them, which can potentially lead to [[fun]].

== Constructing around ice ==
Using the "smooth stone" and "carve fortification" designations works as normal with ice. However, if an [[aquifer]] or other source of water is present next to your new fortification, it will immediately freeze into an ice wall when the water flows into it.

The freezing/thawing of ice deconstructs anything occupying the same space as the block of ice, including floor hatches, grates, wells and supports built in the z-level above it (because the frozen ice wall below creates an implied frozen ice floor above). It also has the potential to trap dwarves in ice, instantly killing them. Extreme care must be taken when releasing water from behind ice blocks.

== Adventurer mode ==
As in fortress mode, an adventurer standing in a water tile as it freezes will be killed.  However, it is possible to walk across frozen oceans to reach islands and continents that otherwise would be inaccessible.

=== Drinking ice ===
Water carried in any container carried by an adventurer will freeze, if brought to a cold enough area.  Frozen water cannot (obviously enough) be drunk to fulfill thirst needs, so it is necessary to thaw it.
# Press {{adv menu icon|g}} and select "Make Campfire"
# Interact {{adv menu icon|I}} with either the ice in your inventory, or a container with ice inside
# Select the option to "Heat ice near campfire"
# The ice will melt into drinkable water, which may be {{adv menu icon|e}} eaten

You can also obtain a drinkable water supply from melting snow in the same fashion.

== Bugs ==
* If a structure is supported by ice which then melts seasonally, the game does not check to see if the structure should collapse, resulting in a building hovering over the now-melted ice.{{bug|227}}
* Removing an ice ramp can create "void" tiles.{{bug|1981}} Casting ice in the tile and then [[Channel|channeling]] the tile can remove the "void" status.
* When an ice boulder melts underground, it becomes an item named "water" that differs from regular water thus: it has no liquid level, does not leave mud when it evaporates, is cyan rather than blue, and dwarves eventually remove it with a "clean" job. {{Bug|360}}
