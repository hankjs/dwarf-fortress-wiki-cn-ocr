'''Sieges''' are large-scale assaults on your fortress by other [[civilization]]s, and a step beyond [[ambush]]es. Sieges are drawn from moving units advancing towards the fortress, whether from an army, a bandit group, or a necromancer's [[Tower (necromancy)|tower]]. They are announced with a full-screen message that differs depending on the attacking race, and the main screen showing the {{DFtext|SIEGE|6:4:1}} tag at the top for the duration of the siege. In the premium version, it looks like this:<br>
[[File:siege_icon.png]]<br>

A siege's objective is to exterminate every [[dwarf]] in your fortress, or die trying. It is possible to be sieged by all civilized races, with the exception of [[kobold]]s and subterranean [[animal people]]; these two never go beyond ambushes. Enemy civilizations will begin to send sieges against your fortress once its [[population]] reaches 80 members, with the exception of the undead, who may attack at any time.

[[Caravan]]s will not arrive at an already-besieged fortress, but will, unfortunately, arrive if a siege is not broken quickly enough - it is possible to miss out entirely on a civilization's caravan for the year this way. Even if they do arrive before the siege, the attackers may kill them or chase them off if they can reach them. '''Consider this when deciding how you set up your [[trade depot]] and how heavily reliant your economy is on imported goods.'''

A civilization will be unable to lay siege if it can't ''reach'' your fortress site, that is, armies need to physically move to the location of your fortress; they are normally allowed a 30-tile radius of interaction (towers have 10 tiles), beyond which sieges are impossible. Specifically, you will never get sieges if you embark on an [[island]], or in a valley which is completely surrounded by [[mountain]]s. If you want to make sure that a certain civilization will be (in)/capable of laying siege to you, then look at the "neighbors" view of the embark site finder when selecting your fortress site.

== Structure of a siege ==
*Siege forces usually consist of a single general or commander (sometimes labeled "Master") and several "squads". Using the [[goblin]]s as an example, each squad consists of several goblins of one military class (swordsman, lasher, etc.), and often one "squad leader" (typically an Elite or better, which need not be the same class as the squad being led).
*Occasionally, a squad will be mounted – this means each of its members will be riding a suitable [[creature]], though the creatures typically vary between squads. The squad leader can be mounted, even if their squad is not. These mounts can change the combat dynamics, since some can fly, are [[building destroyer]]s, or have substantially different combat traits from their riders. For more info on mounted units, and the [[fun]] they can unleash upon an ill-prepared defender, see: [[Mount]].
*Invaders can bring battering rams, which will destroy trees and constructions.
*Sieges may have one or more squads of Siege Engineers, typically [[Troll]]s or [[blind cave ogre]]s, who carry 20 rock blocks per engineer.  They will construct stairs and floors to bridge moats and climb on-top of walls and towers.
*Sieges may have one or more squads of miners, typically [[Troll]]s, who carry a large pick.  They will dig through floors and walls, including both constructed walls and natural stone, in order to breach the fortress.  The speed of their digging is significantly slower than dwarves, and the material of the wall will affect their digging speed.  For constructed walls, it's calculated similar to a blunt force attack on the wall, so a reinforced wall with steel will last even longer than one reinforced with copper.
*Invaders will avoid traps that they have observed being sprung and automatically reset, such as weapons traps.  If a cage trap captures an invader, his fellow attackers will attempt to free him from the cage.  If one or more invaders flee and successfully escape the siege at the end of the attack, their knowledge of the traps will persist into the next siege that attacks, so it is suggested to tear down and rebuild traps in a new location in between sieges.
*Invaders can climb [[wall]]s and pits. This can be quite [[fun]] if your fort defense relies on the same kinds of walls and pits as previous versions.
*In the pause menu, your retiring option will change from "retire your fortress" to "succumb to the invasion". Choosing this option will lead to the siege succeeding and the dwarves being killed.
*After being sufficiently "successful" at defending against the siege (killing sufficient attackers, waiting them out, or some combination thereof), the attackers will retreat. All of the remaining squads and groups will head for the map edges and leave, typically favoring the edge they entered from. Once all of the remaining attackers have decided to retreat, the {{DFtext|SIEGE|6:4:1}} tag will go away.
*It is possible to have multiple sieges at the same time. If the attacking civilizations are at war with each other, they will start to fight with each other as well.
*You can turn off sieges and [[megabeast]]s altogether by changing "civilizations can attack" and "megabeasts can attack" to NO in the difficulty settings.
*Depending on how your fortress is set up, [[winter]] can be the worst time for a siege due to any outside water being frozen. If your fortress is surrounded by a moat, or is meant to be blocked off by water in some way, your enemies will simply walk over the [[ice]] and climb over any walls into your fortress.

=== Difficulty ===
{{main|Difficulty}}
On normal difficulty, the intensity of enemy attacks directly corresponds to your [[fortress]]'s title. Once sieges are possible, 25% of invasions will be sieges instead of [[Ambush|ambushes]]. On hard difficulty, the trigger conditions for enemies are roughly halved, allowing more invaders to attack earlier. The frequency of sieges instead of ambushes increases to 50%.

By default, a max of 120 soldiers and 40 monsters can attack your fortress during a siege.

== [[Goblin]] sieges ==
[[File:The last stand by ncorva.jpg|thumb|250px|We hear the drums, they are coming...<br><small>''Art by ncorva''</small>]]
{{dftext|A vile force of darkness has arrived!|5:1}}

Formerly, the tactics used by the goblins were no more sophisticated than charging in an open march toward your fortress, and attempting to kill your dwarves; however, as of version 53 (also known as the ''siege'' update), their tactics are much more varied. Goblin sieges often include groups of [[troll]]s and [[beak dog]]s, but may also include things like [[ogre]]s, or [[cave dragon]]s (along with some other "Subterranean" and evil "Fantasy" creatures), that can [[Building destroyer|break buildings]] and smash workshops. Trolls in particular are especially problematic, as they are able to wield [[weapon|great picks]] to dig through your defenses (and to tunnel through the ground if need be), as well as carrying [[block]]s they can use to bridge over your moats and open otherwise unavailable avenues for attack. Goblins may also bring fighters belonging to other races (previously kidnapped as children by [[snatcher]]s), and if you're really lucky, they may be commanded by something particularly [[Demon|fun]]. Goblin sieges usually involve [[mount]]ed squads, some of which can fly over whatever defenses you might have set up to stop them, and battering rams, which they can utilise against your defenses.

Interestingly, the goblin civilization lacks the {{token|SIEGER|e}} token, while large-scale attacks by them nevertheless activate the {{DFtext|SIEGE|6:4:1}} state. This suggests that the token doesn't regulate the overall ability to send out sieging forces, but merely enables large attacking forces to set up camp and try to wait out a fort – the behavior often seen in human sieges – instead of charging in blindly like a pack of fools (THIS INFORMATION MAY BE OUTDATED AS OF V53). Goblins are also the only race who can siege your fortress without their civilization being explicitly at [[war]] with your own, presumably because their evil nature makes them disregard diplomacy entirely.

== [[Elf|Elven]] sieges ==
{{dftext|An ambush! Curse all friends of nature!|4:1}}

It is possible to have elven attacks as well, but that usually requires some effort on the part of the player, or for your starting civilization to have a pre-existing conflict with a nearby elven one - you can check this when you embark while looking at nearby civilizations, where it will read {{DFtext|WAR|4:1}} next to the elf civilization, though it seems to be entirely dependent on how world gen plays out, and embarking at a time when a war is happening. Another, possibly simpler (and more amusing) way to elven siege is to blatantly provoke them. If you don't want to be attacked by elves you should not offer them wooden goods or goods stored in wooden barrels or bins. You might also avoid clearing too much woodland, as elves will be offended if you do so. Unless you want to be attacked by them, don't send squads to [[Mission|raid]] their sites in the civilization screen.

Elves ambush using stealth squads rather than siege, to hide their numbers and locations. It should be noted, however, that unlike goblin ambushes which cap at four squads, elves can come in '''massive''' numbers, atop mighty (and [[Butcher|tasty]]) [[unicorn]]s or other [[elephant|exotic beasts]] (like unaligned/mundane/giant animals, and good-aligned creatures). Fortunately, unlike goblins and humans, who wear heavy armor and wield [[metal]] weapons that can cause considerable damage, the elves are very weak in battle - their weapons and arrows are made of [[wood]], which will simply bounce off any standard metal armor, and they march into battle wearing easily breakable wooden armor, or even nothing but [[cloth]] robes and trousers.

== [[Human]] sieges ==
[[File:human_siege_preview.png|thumb|250px|right|Being taller helps with war-related things.<br><small>''Art by by John Gilbert (1817 - 1897 CE)''</small>]]
{{dftext|The enemy have come and are laying siege to the fortress.|5:1}}

Humans may also siege you if you let their [[diplomat]] die while visiting your fortress; if too many of their trade wagons get destroyed, if you trade with an elven nation the humans are at war with, or if you raid their sites. Humans sometimes set up a camp near the map edge they arrived on, harassing wandering dwarves and waiting for you to come to them instead of blindly charging toward your fortress. 

Humans often ride mundane animals, such as [[horse]]s, [[camel]]s (of both varieties), or war [[grizzly bear]]s, and may bring along further war animals like trained [[cheetah]]s, or even [[elephant]]s. Be aware that human siegers know about all [[trap]]s that their diplomats have seen before; even their war animals are immune to those traps. If you have had a human diplomat in your fort, assume that your traps are useless against the invaders unless they were built after their last visit. A removed and rebuilt trap counts as "new", even if it's the same type of trap in the same tile.

== [[Necromancer]] sieges ==
{{dftext|The dead walk. Hide while you still can!|5:1}}<br>
{{dftext|Forms twisted from their nature, legion of the night. What hope remains?|5:1}}

Necromancers will only be able to siege you if you embark in an area near a [[Tower (necromancy)|tower]]. If no tower is present in the neighbors list, no necromancers will ever besiege your fortress unless you attack them first.

Necromancers will besiege your fortress by sending [[undead]] to your fort or even coming themselves. Either way, undead sieges are a guaranteed source of [[Fun]]. The undead units will arrive from all sides of the map, slowly meandering towards your fortress. Undead sieges may arrive with as few as one zombie to as many as fifty or more—and if a necromancer is present with them, anyone that dies in or near battle (or lying somewhere near it) is likely to be revived as a new zombie, complete with all the skills, attributes, and equipment it had in life. The undead in general are serious enemies, that one cannot treat like goblin garbage. A legendary squad can take down unarmed zombies in equal numbers, but the large numbers that necromancers can bring are unmatchable. To make things worse, "elite" zombie fighters may carry ''weapons and armor'', a truly terrifying thought were there ever one.

While normally human, goblin and elven invaders usually do not have access to [[steel]] (with elves not using metal weapons/armour at all), if the original necromancer of the group (the one who was given the slab during worldgen) was a dwarf, it is not uncommon for the undead invaders to use steel. Yes, that means being invaded by steel-clad elven zombies with steel swords, for example.

It is recommended that you have <s>many traps</s> every single trap with the best available materials you could possibly build set in advance, and when the undead legions arrive, '''shut down everything'''. Be sure to shut down all of your [[butcher's shop]]s, crypts, and [[refuse]] [[stockpile]]s, as necromancers can reanimate armies of body parts to destroy your fortress from the inside. Be also careful with [[fishery]] workshops, as reports of [[mussel]] [[shell]]s rising from the dead are fairly common. Necromancers will raise any [[corpse]] or corpse part that they see, and simple proximity to undead can cause things like [[skin]] and [[hair]] to rise and attack the unfortunate butcher. It doesn't really matter how many zombies arrive; if you are not prepared, you will probably get slaughtered, as one zombie can easily become two zombies, then four, then eight and so on. If the zombies cannot attack your dwarves immediately, they will simply mill about on the surface until something living (wild animals included) comes too close or until they are all destroyed. Like other sieges, it is also possible to wait out necromancer sieges, though this can take a year or more. When fighting zombies that used to be your own dwarves, be sure not to let anyone who knew that dwarf fight them—it generates a strong negative [[thought]] on top of the reduction to sanity caused by fighting the living dead. Use [[Attack type|blunt]] weapons whenever possible—a mangled corpse is one that will stay dead, and with no functioning organs to damage, the only other way to stop them is through decapitation or bisection.

Undead sieges can attack your fortress at any time, including before the second spring's elven caravan arrives, or even before the first dwarven caravan arrives in the fall of your first year (thus preventing its arrival). The number of undead sent will depend on your wealth and population, and early sieges tend to have as few as three undead—but can cause very much cheesy [[fun]] if a lone necromancer accompanies them (which isn't uncommon).

(If [[experiment]]s are brought along, the latter message will be shown. Sometimes these "sieges" of experiments will be very small, consisting of only a few experiments and no necromancer.)

== [[Dwarf|Dwarven]] sieges ==
{{dftext|The enemy have come and are laying siege to the fortress.|5:1}}

Dwarves of a different entity from yours will normally not interact with your fortress. However, should the player [[Mission|raid]] the sites of another dwarven civilization, or refuse to give a petitioned [[legendary artifact]] if requested, the other dwarves may declare war on yours, leading to dwarven sieges. It isn't possible to be attacked by dwarves of your own entity.

Dwarves employ tactics similar to those of humans during sieges, and employ war beasts and cavalry equivalent to their own or to those used by goblins, as they have access both to above-ground and subterranean resources. Enemy dwarves can be particularly [[fun]] to face due to them possessing access to everything the player has, including the likes of steel equipment, and due to being able to enter [[martial trance]]s much like your own dwarves.

== [[Bandit]] sieges ==
Roving bandit groups near by your fortress may also besiege it, happening potentially as early as ''the first year'', making them an excellent source of surprise [[fun]].

Bandit groups are drawn from any entity with the {{token|BANDITRY|e}} and {{token|LOCAL_BANDITRY|e}} tokens. In unmodded games, these are [[goblin]]s, [[human]]s and [[kobold]]s, though other races (even [[dwarves]]) have been reported. Their announcement messages are the same as the messages for regular sieges of their race. Bandit sieges are generally smaller than a later-game full-blown siege, more similar in size to goblin [[ambush]]es, as there are fewer units from which to draw combatants. Bandits tend to be poorly equipped and skilled, some being recruits with no weapons or armour (''as would be expected of such matters of war'').

== Bugs ==
* Amphibian invader mounts drown their riders. {{Bug|926}}
* Occasionally sieges will not end with all invaders being dealt with. In such cases the siege seems to end after several months by itself. {{Bug|10075}}
