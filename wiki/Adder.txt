'''Adders''' are [[syndrome|venomous]] [[Creature|snakes]] found in many [[temperate]] [[biome]]s. Their bites deliver a [[venom]] that can cause immediate strong [[Symptom#Pain|pain]], followed by long-term (but not permanent) [[syndrome|nausea, blisters, and swelling]]. Though the bite itself is not usually fatal, such pain can cause unconsciousness, which ''can'' lead to fatal complications in combat.

Adders are distinct for being the [[list of creatures by adult size|smallest creatures]] in the game which aren't [[vermin]].

Adders can be captured in [[cage]] [[trap]]s and [[Animal trainer|trained]] into cheap exotic [[pet]]s. They are born adults and as such can't be permanently tamed. [[Butcher]]ing an adder only produces a [[skull]], making them worthless to your [[meat industry]]. Female adders are [[egg]]-layers, producing 3-10 edible eggs with regularity, and providing significantly more food than would be expected from such a small creature.

Some dwarves [[Preferences|like]] adders for their ''warning hisses''.
