'''Whale sharks''' are massive [[Creature|sharks]] who inhabit [[tropical]] [[ocean]]s. They are among the [[List of creatures by adult size#end of list|largest creatures]] in the game and are the largest of all fish. Colossal as they are, they are benign and harmless to [[dwarves]], who are more likely to drown by being on water, rather than being attacked by one of these. An infant whale shark is called a ''whale shark pup''.

Being non-vermin fish, [[Fisherdwarf|fisherdwarves]] can't fish whale sharks, but they can be caught in [[drowning chamber]]s and [[butcher]]ed for an immense amount of returns. As [[Cartilage|cartilaginous]] fish, butchered whale sharks won't provide you with [[bone]]s, though you'll still get a [[skull]] from them.

Some dwarves [[Preferences|like]] whale sharks for their ''gentle nature''.
