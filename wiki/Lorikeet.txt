'''Lorikeets''' are a species of [[vermin]] who inhabit [[tropical]] moist broadleaf [[forest]]s and mangrove [[Wetland|swamps]]. They may be captured in [[animal trap]]s and turned into [[pet]]s. All lorikeets possess Legendary [[skill]] in [[Climber|climbing]].

Some dwarves [[Preferences|like]] lorikeets for their ''bright coloration'' and their ''playful personalities''.
