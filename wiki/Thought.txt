[[File:thoughts_v50_preview.png|258px|right]]'''Thoughts''' are the reported observations and sentiments of [[dwarves]] in [[Dwarf fortress mode|fortress mode]], visible on the [[thoughts and preferences]] subscreen of their [[profile]]. A thought can either be a happy thought (positive thought) or a bad thought (negative thought). Over the course of play, a dwarf will experience circumstances that evoke specific [[emotion]]s based on their [[personality]].

A dwarf's recent emotions contribute to their [[stress]] level, displayed on the thoughts and preferences screen in somewhat subjective terms – to avoid bad thoughts, make [[keeping your dwarves happy]] a priority. Even when nothing is happening, a dwarf can still relive a past experience through [[memory (thought)|memories]], and thus a single experience can produce not just one thought at the time it happens, but many thoughts, as they remember that experience again and again. Dwarves can also feel nothing or not care about certain situations, giving them a neutral thought. A few examples of different levels of thoughts can go as follows: 

{{DFtext|He felt|7:0}}{{DFtext| satisfied|2:0:1}}{{DFtext| at work. He felt|7:0}}{{DFtext| satisfied|2:0:1}}{{DFtext| upon improving mining.|7:0}}<br />
{{DFtext|He was|7:0}}{{DFtext| uneasy|6:0}}{{DFtext| after seeing a human's dead body.|7:0}}<br />
{{DFtext|He felt|7:0}}{{DFtext| restless|6:0}}{{DFtext| dwelling upon|5:0:1}}{{DFtext| seeing a goblin die.|7:0}}<br />
{{DFtext|He didn't feel anything after seeing a dog's dead body.|7:0}}<br />

To view a dwarf's recent thoughts and current stress level, press {{k|u}} to open the [[citizenship|citizens]] screen, find the dwarf in the list, and click the {{k|🔍}} to the right of their name. Or, move to the dwarf and select them with the mouse {{k|🖱️}}. This brings you to the thoughts and preferences screen for that dwarf, which, among other things, describes the dwarf's overall stress level as well as their constituent thoughts.

Below is a list of circumstances that may inspire thoughts.
