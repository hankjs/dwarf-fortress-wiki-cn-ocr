'''Black mambas''' are small solitary [[Creature|snakes]] who inhabit a number of [[tropical]] [[biome]]s. They are about as heavy as a [[cat]] and take 10 years to reach their max size. What distinguishes them from most other snakes is the virulence of their [[venom]], with short-term [[syndrome|symptoms]] including dizziness, drowsiness, strong pain, fever, unconsciousness, and complete paralysis, in ascending order to the [[size]] of the creature bitten. For a small creature like a [[dwarf]], a single bite is enough to kill them within [[Time|seconds]], as paralysis of the diaphragm leads to suffocation.

Black mambas are also the only species of snake that is prone to rage; while they don't do it as often as animals like [[badger]]s, they have a small chance to flip out and attack any creature in their vicinity, including dwarves. Mamba fangs are too small to pierce normal [[clothing]] reliably, but with some luck they can thereafter cause some real damage to your fortress.

Black mambas can be caught in [[cage]] [[trap]]s and [[Animal trainer|trained]] into exotic [[pet]]s. They are born adults and can't be permanently tamed. Their females are prolific [[egg]]-layers, making them a good target for [[egg production]], though they are subpar in a [[meat industry]] compared to most [[domestic animal]]s.

Some dwarves [[Preferences|like]] black mambas for their ''deadly bite'' and their ''aggression''.
