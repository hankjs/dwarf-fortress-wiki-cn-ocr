'''Sparrows''' are a species of [[above ground]] [[vermin]], who may be found in almost every [[biome]] in the game, as well as captured in [[animal trap]]s and turned into [[pet]]s. All sparrows possess Legendary [[skill]] in [[Climber|climbing]].

Some dwarves [[Preferences|like]] sparrows for their ''lovely songs'' and their ''dust baths''.

{{D for Dwarf}}

Contrary to popular superstitions, sparrows are unable to learn and therefore cannot gain experience, let alone transform into giant sparrows upon having enough [[skill|levels]].
