'''Tanner''' is the skill associated with the '''tanning''' [[labor]]. Tanners turn raw [[skin]]s from [[butcher]]ed [[animals]] into usable [[leather]] at a [[tanner's shop]]. They have to act fast, as raw skins will [[rot]] fairly soon after being created. By default this job will automatically be queued when a skin is produced, but this can be deactivated from the {{k|o}}rders-workshops menu. If you're still not getting the hide tanned, enter the order "tan a hide" manually in the manager menu ({{k|j}}-{{k|m}}) with a sufficient amount. Each butchering job produces a single skin, but tanning an unrotten hide may produce multiple pieces of leather, depending on the creature's size. 

Tanners also make [[parchment]] using [[milk of lime]] and a raw hide.  Parchment is a somewhat difficult-to-make alternative to [[paper]] or [[papyrus]].  Parchment made from a cow's hide is called vellum, but is otherwise identical.

High proficiency in the tanning skill affects how quickly the raw skin is processed in both cases. Leather does not have quality modifiers, but parchment does.
