'''Mosquitos''' are [[hateable]] [[vermin]] found in all non-freezing [[biome]]s. They will give [[Thought#Unhappy_Thoughts|unhappy thoughts]] to [[Dwarf|dwarves]] who absolutely detest mosquitos when they encounter them. While the female caste can suck [[blood]], this does not currently affect dwarves in any way. All mosquitos possess Legendary [[skill]] in [[Climber|climbing]].

Some dwarves [[preferences|like]] mosquitos for their ''high-pitched buzz'' and their ''ability to feast on blood''.
