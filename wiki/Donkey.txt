'''Donkeys''' are a [[domestic animal]] that provide a source of [[milk]] and [[cheese]] in addition to [[meat]]. They are slightly smaller than [[horse]]s and [[cow]]s, but a single donkey can still feed two [[Dwarf|dwarves]] for about a year. They can be obtained on [[embark]] or through [[trading]], and can't be found in the wild. Like other domestic herbivores, they require a [[pasture]] to survive.

Despite their similarities to horses, donkeys are not ridable [[mount]]s in [[adventure mode]]. ([[Mule]]s are also not ridable mounts.)

Some dwarves [[Preferences|like]] donkeys for their ''stubborness''.
