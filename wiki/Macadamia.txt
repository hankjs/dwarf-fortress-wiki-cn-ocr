'''Macadamia''' is one of the many genera of [[tree]]s found above ground. Like the vast majority of above ground trees, macadamia [[wood]] is brown and produces brown products. An [[herbalist]] with a [[stepladder]] can gather macadamia nuts from a macadamia tree. Despite being considered seeds, they cannot be planted, but can be [[cook|cooked]].

Some [[Dwarf|dwarves]] [[Preferences|like]] macadamia trees for their ''nuts''.
