'''Orange''' is one of the many genera of [[tree]]s found above ground. Contrary to its name, orange [[wood]] is in fact brown, and produces brown products.

Orange trees bear '''oranges''' that can be harvested by setting up a gathering [[zone]].

Some [[Dwarf|dwarves]] [[Preferences|like]] orange trees for their ''fruit''.
