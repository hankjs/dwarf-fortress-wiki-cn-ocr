Some items can be in a '''stack''' representing multiple of the same exact same item, with some always produced in stacks: [[alcohol]] is always produced in stacks 5 times the size of the input stack; [[prepared meal]]s are produced in stack sizes equal to the sum of the input stack sizes; [[bones]], [[coins]], and crossbow [[bolts]] are some others that are produced in stacks.

==Identifying stacks==
Stacks of items are displayed as an item name with a number in brackets next to it. For example, "Iron bolts [20]" is a stack of 20 iron [[crossbow]] bolts. A dwarf can pick up the entire stack and carry it, or a [[marksdwarf]] can remove a single bolt from the stack and fire it.

For a stack of food or booze, a dwarf will consume a single unit at a sitting; the size of the stack does not affect how much the dwarf will consume.

In [[adventure mode]], some stacks, like meat, can be partially picked up, thus splitting the stack, others cannot.

Some items will always be named in the plural, even when only a single item; examples includes [[bar|metal bars]] and small [[gem]]s, a single "small gems" item actually being larger than a single "large gem" item. This implies that a single unit of these is also sort of a stack, and a stack of them is a stack of stacks, but a unit of these will always be used as a single item.

Other items like [[soap]], [[thread]], and [[cloth]], can have a [[Reaction#PRODUCT_DIMENSION|dimension]] that can be partially used, vaguely similar to a stack.

==Combining stacks==
''Dwarf Fortress'' does not provide a way to combine different items of the same type into a stack. For example, if you have two stacks of [[plump helmet]]s, each with a count of two, it's not possible to combine them into a single stack of four plump helmets. Also, if you fire a single [[ammo|arrow]] from a stack of 30 arrows, you won't be able to put the fired arrow back into the original stack, and you'll eventually end up with 30 stacks of arrows, each containing just a single arrow. The closest things the game has to combining stacks is [[melt]]ing metal items, or using multiple ingredient stacks to make one stack of meals.

However, [[DFHack]] provides the [https://docs.dfhack.org/en/latest/docs/tools/combine.html combine] tool.
