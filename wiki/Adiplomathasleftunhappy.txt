{{DFtext|A diplomat has left unhappy}}

A player will encounter this message when a [[diplomat]] is unable to fulfill their duties and chooses to leave the map. This may occur if your [[leader]], [[mayor]], or other [[noble]] is unable to perform the "conduct meeting" task for several months, or immediately if your noble is killed, replaced, or taken by a [[strange mood]]{{bug|576}}. Curiously, this will '''not''' occur if the diplomat is physically prevented from attending the "conduct meeting" task. You can currently lock a diplomat in a room, and they will wait years to attend the meeting your noble is constantly conducting (and all subsequent diplomats appear to wait patiently in line for the first to finish); this behavior is presumably a bug.{{bug|8947}}

A diplomat that is being chased down by [[goblin]]s or other invaders may leave preemptively, which even happens when you order your own dwarves to attack them, though that will be [[Loyalty cascade|fun]].
