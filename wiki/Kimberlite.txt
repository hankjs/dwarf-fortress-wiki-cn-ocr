'''Kimberlite''' is a special type of igneous intrusive [[stone]], found only as veins in [[gabbro]] stone [[layer]]s. While a basic stone itself, with a pleasing blueish-gray color, it is the only stone in which [[diamond]]s can naturally appear (they can also appear in [[Obsidian#Suspicious_Rock_Formations|unnatural places]]).
