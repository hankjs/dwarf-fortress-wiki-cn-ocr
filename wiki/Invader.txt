{{av}}

'''Invader''' is a catch-all term for creatures that come to your fortress with the sole purpose of killing and/or enslaving your [[Dwarf|dwarves]]. Outside of hostile wildlife, they serve as the main source of [[fun]] of a playthrough as more and more critters choose to try and destroy you. Whenever an invader is discovered, the game will pause, center on them, and a red message will alert the player of what exactly they are.

Whether a fortress is targeted by invaders is mainly related to its total population, its accumulated [[wealth]] and its distance from the invader's base of operations, though some types of invasions may skip certain prerequisites. Most invaders also require a land path to the fortress in order to invade it, meaning some invasions can be avoided by settling on an [[island]].

The presence of invaders can be customized in <code>Settings</code>→<code>Difficulty</code>; changing to <code>Enemies: Off</code> will disable invaders (though this will not prevent [[intrigue]] or [[HFS]]), or by clicking the Custom Settings button, more fine-tuning (such as adjusting the type and frequency of enemies) may be done.

==Types of invaders==

*[[Ambush]]es and [[siege]]s, launched by [[civilization]]s at [[war]] with your dwarves
*[[Megabeast]]s and [[semi-megabeast]]s
*[[Thief|Thieves]], such as [[goblin]] snatchers and [[kobold]] thieves
*[[Werebeast]]s

{{D for Dwarf}}

Back in the good ol' days we could just say "[[Goblin]]" and everyone would know what you meant. But what with goblin [[merchant]]s popping up every year (admittedly only at a few new-age dwarven forts that proclaim "free love" and "tolerance" and "baloney"); and both [[human]]s, [[elf|elves]] and even other [[dwarf|dwarves]] mustering their forces for war, such racist remarks are no longer tolerated in today's modern dwarven society,

No, when someone visits your fort to stick the pointy end of their sword through your beer-soaked belly you should be politically correct and say "Oh drat! An ''invader''!  Curse them!"  We don't want <s>goblins</s> creatures getting upset.

==Trivia==
*Invading creatures can do so regardless of their [[age]], which can lead to rare and unusual events such as being attacked by a werebeast [[Children|child]] or a [[roc]] hatchling. In the case it is a werebeast, it can still maim your citizens, no matter how young it is.
