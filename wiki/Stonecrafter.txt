'''Stone crafter''' is the skill associated with the '''stonecrafting''' [[labor]]. Stonecrafters create [[finished goods|goods]] such as [[mug]]s, [[craft]]s, [[instrument]]s, and [[toy]]s as well as [[short sword]]s, [[jug]]s, [[pot]]s, [[nest box]]es and [[hive]]s from loose [[stone]] at a [[craftsdwarf's workshop]].  On maps with an [[obsidian]] layer, embarking with a Proficient stonecrafter can produce more valuable [[obsidian]] trade goods for your early exchanges with the [[caravan]]s and also provide short swords for your military and any weapon traps you choose to build.

Because stone exists in abundance and is rather a nuisance than a valuable resource in most fortresses, turning some unemployed dwarves into stonecrafters and having them create rock goods is a good way to get rid of some stone while also creating some [[trade good]]s. See [[stone management]] for other ways to control your stone production.

Note that Stonecrafters are distinct from both [[Stone carver|Stone <u>Carvers</u>]] and [[Stonecutter|Stone<u>cutters</u>]]. The former, 'Carvers, use a [[stoneworker's workshop]] to make [[quality]] stone [[furniture]], while the latter, 'Cutters, can change unmined stone surfaces into several useful shapes for your fortress, and also can use a [[craftdwarf's workshop]] to make stone [[block]]s.

==Notes==

*Skilled stonecrafters can produce up to 3 small objects at a time from a single stone.

*[[Large pot]]s are suitable to replace [[barrel]]s in most applications, freeing up less abundant [[wood]] for other uses (primarily [[bed]]s and [[bin]]s)

*Rock [[short sword]]s can only be produced with "sharpenable hard rock" -- specifically, [[obsidian]] -- and require [[wood]] for their handles as well.
