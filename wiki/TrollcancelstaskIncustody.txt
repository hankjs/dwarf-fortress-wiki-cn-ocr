This message occurs when a tame [[troll]] is interrupted at work, due to being taken for [[shearing]] in the [[farmer's workshop]]. This can occur only in [[modding|modded]] games, because in vanilla the [[dwarf|dwarven]] [[civilization]] cannot tame trolls in the first place. After being sheared, the troll will continue his work.
