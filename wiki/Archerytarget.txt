An '''archery target''' is a [[building]] which is used to to train your [[marksdwarves]]. Archery targets can be built from [[wood]], which requires [[carpentry]]; [[stone]] or [[glass]], which requires [[masonry]]; or [[metal]], which requires [[metalcrafting]]. They can also be built from [[block]]s made from the above materials.

==Making an archery range==
To make an archery range,
[[File:Archery_Range_Zone.png|right|An archery range zone Options.]]
#{{Menu icon|b|y|t}} Build one or more Archery targets in a room/area
#{{Menu icon|z}} Make an Archery Range [[zone]] over the constructed archery targets.  [[Barracks]] and Archery Range zones can be stacked so the Archery Range can be included in the Barracks footprint.
#Paint the Archery Range zone like any other.
#Select the zone and specify the shooting direction.
#[[File:Ui assign squad.jpg]] Assign the range to the desired [[squads]] using the flag icon.

The zone can then be used by military dwarves who have '''''no order''''' (i.e. they're set to inactive or set to only active/training){{Bug|6070}} in their [[schedule]] that month, in order to train ranged [[weapon]] [[skills]]. Since [[bolt]]s are being used up by this training, it may be a good idea to [[equipment|set]] the dwarves to only use [[bone]] or [[wood]]en bolts when training.

Archery ranges may include any number of archery targets. The dwarves will simply line up on one end and shoot at the other end of the range, with one dwarf per 'width' of the zone able to use the range at once.

It is also advisable for the archery target rooms to be included in the area of the barracks where your marksdwarves train. Both the barracks and the archery targets need to be assigned to squads individually.

==Notes==
*The size of the range must be large enough so that the marksdwarf is able to stand at least 1 tile away from the target (Dwarves will '''not''' train if the size of the range means they have to stand adjacent to the target).
*Experience is granted per shot, not per target hit.
*Only one soldier can use an archery target at a time.
*Marksdwarves will only practice at an archery range if their [[quiver]]s contain ammunition which is permitted for training.
*Marksdwarves do not spend all of their free time performing archery practice - during downtime, they will complain that they "cannot follow orders". Assigning marksdwarves to a [[barracks]] will allow them to use this spare time to perform combat drills, though said drills can potentially cut into archery practice.
*When setting up training orders for your marksdwarf squad, rather than setting 1 order for X number of dwarves to train, it's advisable to set multiple training orders of 1 dwarf each. If a train order contains multiple dwarves, even if their only training area is an Archery Range, they may decide to do group drills rather than practice at the range. Since range practice is always solo, setting several 1 dwarf training orders will guarantee they practice their marksdwarfship.

==Bugs==
*The flag for active/inactive seems to get mixed up, so marksdwarves will only use archery targets when they're inactive.{{Bug|6070}}
