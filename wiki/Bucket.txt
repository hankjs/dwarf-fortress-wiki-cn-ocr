'''Buckets''' are handheld vessels made of [[wood]] at a [[carpenter's workshop]] or [[metal]] at a [[metalsmith's forge]] or [[magma forge]].

They are used for carrying [[water]], filling designated [[pond]]s, making [[lye]], milking [[animals]], cleaning wounded dwarves, and giving water to thirsty dwarves who are wounded or busy. Milk and lye can also be ''stored'' in buckets, but dwarves will prefer to empty the buckets into suitable [[barrel]]s. A bucket is also needed for the construction of a [[well]], [[soap maker's workshop]], [[ashery]], or [[dyer's shop]].

Buckets of all types are stored in furniture [[stockpile]]s.

[[Metal]] buckets are one of the few objects made with [[blacksmith]]ing that uses 1 [[bar]], with [[block]]s being the other. This makes them useful for training blacksmiths, as the buckets can be melted down for a single bar, and training can occur even when metals are scarce.

In [[temperature]]s below freezing, such as within [[glacier]] layers, water will freeze inside buckets, rendering them unusable (and disabling wells, which will show a "bucket full" message). To avoid that, build wells and [[hospital]]s (the main destination of water) down below the glacial [[ice]], in its earthen layers. To recover a frozen bucket, [[dump]] the ice within it.

In order to empty a filled bucket at a specific location, one can construct and place a [[display furniture]] at the desired location. Then, assign the desired liquid(s) to this display and deconstruct the furniture. The liquid spills on the ground upon deconstruction.

==Trivia==
*Sometimes, rather than acquiring menacing spikes, hanging rings, bands, encrustation or an image, a bucket will instead gain a material for its handle when decorated.
