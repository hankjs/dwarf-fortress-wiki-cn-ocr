'''Native platinum''' is the only [[ore]] of [[platinum]], one of the most valuable [[metal]]s available (equal in value to [[aluminum]]). Its high material value makes both the ore and the smelted metal a convenient material for high-value furniture for [[noble]]s. If the deposits are not mined out, smoothed and [[engraver|engraved]] platinum walls can add a lot of value to rooms, too.

Native platinum can occur in [[vein|veins]] inside bodies of [[magnetite]] and [[olivine]] and as small [[cluster]]s within [[chromite]]. The veins from magnetite specifically can extend far outside the magnetite they originate from and the vein may even be interrupted at the magnetite cluster border.

When mined, chunks of native platinum are called ''platinum nuggets''.

=== In Real Life ===
Native platinum is technically not an ore; it's simply chunks of mostly pure metallic platinum.  As platinum is an extremely unreactive metal, even less reactive than gold, this is by far the most common form in which platinum is found in nature.
