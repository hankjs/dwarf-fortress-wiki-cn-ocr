'''Black bear men''' are [[animal people]] variants of the common [[black bear]], who can be found in [[savage]] [[temperate]] [[forest]]s and [[taiga]]s, spawning in groups of anywhere between 2-10 individuals, and retain the [[Thief|thieving]] disposition of their animal counterparts, running off with your food and drinking your booze whenever they can. They are significantly larger than a [[dwarf]] and can easily shred a [[peasant]] to pieces if provoked.

Like other savage animal people, black bear men can join [[civilization]]s, become [[historical figure]]s, appear as [[visitor]]s and be playable in [[adventurer mode]].

Some dwarves [[Preferences|like]] black bear men for their ''strength''.
==Trivia==
*Currently, black bear men and [[grizzly bear man|grizzly bear men]] share the same sprite.
