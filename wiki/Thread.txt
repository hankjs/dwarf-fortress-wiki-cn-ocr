[[Plant fiber]]s, [[wool]], and [[web]]s can be turned into weavable '''thread'''. Such thread can then be [[weaver|woven]] into '''[[cloth]]''', which can be used to create a variety of textile products such as [[bag]]s, [[clothing]], [[rope]] or [[craft]]s. ''(For a full discussion of the process and possibilities, see [[textile industry]].)'' An entire spool of thread contains 15,000 inches/units of use.

==Creating thread==
[[File:Dyed thread.png|thumb|right|[[Rope reed]] fiber threads 🧵]]
There exists four types of common thread, each with their own method of creation:
* A [[dwarf]] with the [[plant processing]] [[labor]] enabled can process [[Plant_fiber|certain plants]] into '''thread''' at a [[farmer's workshop]] with the "Process Plants" job order. This trains the [[Thresher]] skill, with higher skill levels increasing the speed at which a dwarf will process plants.
* [[Wool]] is collected from [[sheep]], [[alpaca]]s and [[llama]]s by the "Shear creature" job; the resulting "stacks" of wool must then be processed to yarn with the "Spin Thread" job. These jobs also take place at the [[farmer's workshop]] and require the [[shearer]] and [[spinner]] labors.  
* With a [[loom]], any dwarf with the [[weaver]] [[labor]] enabled will ''automatically'' collect any spider [[silk]] [[web]]s that are on the ground, turning them into thread, by default. This can be disabled in the [[standing orders]] screen in the {{Menu icon|y}} [[labor]]s menu.
* [[Hair]] that is produced from a [[butcher]]ed [[animal]] can be spun into '''hair thread''' at a farmer's workshop using the "Spin Thread" order in a similar manner to wool. Unlike the other types mentioned above, animal hair thread cannot be used for the production of cloth or related items. This type of thread is not part of any [[stockpile]], and by default, will stay in the farmer's workshop where it was made unless it is manually moved elsewhere.

==Uses==
Beyond the aforementioned textile industry, any thread can be used in a [[hospital]] to [[Suturer|suture]] any wounds shut, or at a [[craftsdwarf's workshop]] to bind quires into [[codex|codices]]. These are the only uses of thread made from the hair of non-shearable creatures, as they cannot be spun into [[yarn]]. 

Suturing a wound will use 1% of a spool of thread, leaving the rest in the hospital, e.g., "cave spider silk thread (99%)". Correspondingly, the suture can be viewed in a dwarf's inventory, e.g., "cave spider silk thread (1%), Sewn into Left lower arm". Note that if ''hair thread'' (from a non-shearable creature, e.g., "water buffalo hair thread") is used for suturing, then the remaining spool of thread is just left on that tile. As mentioned, this type of thread cannot be stockpiled. 

All types of thread, weavable or not, can be [[dyer|dyed]].

==Metal strands==

[[Adamantine]] strands are treated as a special type of thread; they can be dyed, used to suture wounds and woven into cloth. However, most adamantine strands should quickly be turned into [[Bar|wafers]], to avoid such usage — using adamantine for a [[suturer]]'s job is widely seen as a frivolous waste of a rare and precious resource.
