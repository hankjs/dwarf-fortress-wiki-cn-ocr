'''Lion tamarins''' are a species of [[above ground]] [[vermin]] found exclusively in [[tropical]] moist broadleaf [[forest]]s. They can be caught in [[animal trap]]s and tamed into [[pet]]s, but other than that, they are generally unremarkable. Their most notable trait is being the only species of vermin based on a primate, while all others in the game are considered full-fledged [[creature]]s. All lion tamarins possess Legendary [[skill]] in [[Climber|climbing]].

Some [[dwarves]] [[Preferences|like]] lion tamarins for their ''small size'' and their ''manes''.
