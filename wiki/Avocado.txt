'''Avocado''' trees are one of the many genera of trees found above ground. Like the vast majority of above ground trees, avocado [[wood]] is brown and produces brown products. Fruits can be eaten raw or cooked and also can be processed in a [[dyer's shop]] into peach [[dye]].

Some [[Dwarf|dwarves]] [[Preferences|like]] avocado trees for their ''fruit''.

Sadly, dwarven cuisine can not produce a guacamole with all of its ingredients. As avocado roasts may only include three ingredients other than avocado, dwarven cooks have heated discussions regarding which these should be. Traditionalist cooks maintain that minced [[lime]] and minced [[pepper]]s are of utmost importance, while others argue that minced [[tomato|tomatoes]], [[onion]] and [[garlic]] are all valid substitutes. Nonetheless, all variants are perfect for dipping [[maize]] biscuits.
