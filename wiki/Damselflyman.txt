'''Damselfly men''' are [[animal people]] variants of the common [[damselfly]] who can appear in [[savage]] [[lake]]s. They spawn in groups of 2-5 individuals and are generally content to keep to themselves, but may pick fights if provoked. In terms of size, they are a little over half the weight of the average [[dwarf]]. All damselfly men are born with Legendary [[skill]] in [[Climber|climbing]].


Some dwarves [[Preferences|like]] damselfly men for their ''coloration''.
==Trivia==
*The damselfly man uses the exact same sprite as the [[dragonfly man]].
