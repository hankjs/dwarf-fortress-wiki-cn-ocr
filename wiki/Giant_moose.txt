After the [[elephant]] and the [[ogre]], the male '''giant moose''' is the [[list of creatures by adult size#end_of_list|third largest]] land-based, [[cavern|above ground]], non-[[amphibious]], non-[[megabeast]], non-[[semi-megabeast]] [[creature]] in the game (almost ''71'' times as large as an average dwarf). This species takes [[savage]] giganticism to an extreme: they are fully eight times the size of a regular [[moose]], and giant moose bulls being nearly twice as large as giant moose cows. In addition to their size, giant moose bulls also have two antlers which they use to great effect in combat. Giant moose can often be found roaming [[savage]] [[forest]]s alone, though they may also appear as dreadfully effective [[mount]]s during a [[siege]].

Giant moose have a [[pet]] value double that of most other "giant" pattern creatures, but when [[tame]]d they require an extremely large [[pasture]] to survive. While giant moose cows are barely tenable, giant bull mooses are almost impossible to keep alive, and can barely manage to feed themselves given ideal pastureland. Their [[butcher]]y [[meat]] products are understandably large in number; of course [[ambusher]]s have a hard time taking one down alone, so if you see one in the wild send your best [[crossbow]] [[squad]] to pincushion it and then bring the [[corpse]] home for butchering.

Some dwarves [[preference|like]] giant moose for their ''great size'' and their ''broad antlers''.
