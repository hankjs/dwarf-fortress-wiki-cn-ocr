'''Giant copperhead snakes''' are the [[Giant animal|oversized]] version their smaller [[copperhead snake|cousins]]. Like most other poisonous snakes, their bites cause a [[syndrome]] which lead to short term pain, swelling, and nausea. This significantly increases the snake's effectiveness in combat, but this snake type's bites are not generally fatal. 

They produce an underwhelming amount of [[meat]] for a creature of their [[size]], and avoid contact with your dwarves unless pressed, so [[hunter]]s should focus on more profitable or threatening targets first.

Some dwarves [[preference|enjoy]] their ''attractive scale patterns''.
