{{release notes}}
:This is the Siege Update. Invaders should cause some more trouble now. Aside from a few minor things mentioned below, you don't have to create a new fort or world for this update.
:We've done about half of the possible changes we were contemplating on the roadmap and we will certainly be doing some more, especially the magical stuff, as work continues. This update is a nice self-contained improvement for regular siege behavior, so we're posting it without further delay.

:Attention Urists!
:The Siege Update is available now! This update completely revamps the way enemies invade your fort, empowering them to dig, build bridges, and overcome old standby defences like water or lava. Invaders will be smarter and have new weapons, but dwarves will also have new defensive tools as well. And to celebrate, the game is currently 20% off until November 10th!
