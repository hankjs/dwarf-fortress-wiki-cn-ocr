[[File:smooth_stone_preview_v50.png|thumb|230px|right|The left room's walls and floor are smoothed. The right room's walls and floor are not.]]'''Smoothing''' rough [[stone]] is a simple way to increase the value of a [[zone]]. Walls and floors become Smooth ''Material'' Wall/Floor when smoothed. It is impossible to [[climb]] a smooth wall.

==How to Smooth==
A dwarf must have the [[Stonecutter|Stonecutting]] labor active. Designate the area to be smoothed ({{menu icon|v|m}}). Note that this can only be done with natural stone – soil cannot be smoothed, and [[construction]]s are already considered to be smooth for most purposes.

Smoothed "natural" [[ice]] has different names from regular smoothed items. Smoothed ice walls are "straight" and smoothed ice floors are "level".

==Follow up==
After a natural stone surface is smoothed, it may be further improved by [[engraving]]. A wall can only be engraved once (for floors, there is a [[Engraving#Removal|workaround]]). This increases the room's value, but, unlike smoothing, engraving has quality levels. Engraving is a separate skill from stone cutter. Using only skilled [[engraver]]s will result in higher room and fortress values. 

Smoothed walls are also a prerequisite for carving [[fortification]]s. Engraved walls can also be carved into fortifications, but the engravings will be destroyed in the process.
