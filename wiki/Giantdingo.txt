Imagine a wild, yellow dog, but slightly smaller than a [[polar bear]]. That is the '''giant dingo'''.

Giant dingoes spawn in every non-freezing savage part of the world, and not only are they far larger than the usual dwarf, they spawn in packs and will attack your dwarves.

Giant dingoes are [[exotic pet]]s and can breed.

== In adventure mode ==
They are scary opponents, far more dangerous (and common) than [[wolf|wolves]], and a creature you will probably lose a few adventurers to. Do not engage them without full [[armor]] and a few friends. They are very fast and in savage worlds can be found in large packs even reaching a dozen dingoes. Be wary when fighting a pack of dingoes head on, and make sure you have space to run. Getting surrounded by these beasts can lead to a lot of [[fun]].

Packs of common giant dingoes are much more dangerous than ones that are named [[historical figure]]s, since the "legendary" giant dingo will always operate on its own.

== In fortress mode ==
Do not let non-military dwarves next to them. Alternatively, [[cage]] them in [[trap]]s, tame them, and start a giant dingo breeding program. While not [[Animal_trainer|trainable]], they are deadlier than most [[bear]]s and, due to their {{token|LARGE_PREDATOR|c}} tag, they will attack enemies. As such, they make a good replacement for your [[dog]]s, and making them trainable is only a minor [[mod]]ding task.
