'''Kingsnakes''' are small, solitary [[Creature|animals]] found in a variety of different [[biome]]s. As their description implies, they carry no [[syndrome]] unlike [[black mamba|some]] [[king cobra|other]] [[rattlesnake|snakes]], making them entirely harmless to the average [[dwarf]]. Like other snakes, they continuously grow through their entire lives, though notably never reach their full size; they require 60 years to reach 1,500 cm³ (which's only about as big as a [[guineafowl]]), but only live up to 30 years. 

Kingsnakes can be captured in [[cage]] [[trap]]s and [[Animal trainer|trained]] into exotic [[pet]]s. They are born adults and as such can't be fully tamed. While virtually useless for a [[meat industry]], they can be placed in a [[nest box]] to lay [[egg]]s, being roughly equivalent to [[duck]]s in egg-laying prowess.

Some dwarves [[Preferences|like]] kingsnakes for their ''coloration'' and their ''habit of eating other snakes''.

{{D for Dwarf}}
Some humans may write [[music]] about how these creatures crawl. It is sometimes thought that they slither, but these humans have shown much foresight in looking at the raws- Without legs, these creatures could only be able to crawl. Good job, humans.
