'''Fish dissector''' is the skill associated with the fish dissection [[labor]].  Their only use is to make the [[mog juice]] [[extract]] from a captured [[moghopper]] at a [[fishery]].  Since moghoppers are fairly rare to catch, this skill is almost completely useless in its current state.

The fish dissector's [[skill|skill level]] is used to determine the speed at which the labor is completed. The [[quality]] and material of the [[barrel]] used adds to the value of the final product.
