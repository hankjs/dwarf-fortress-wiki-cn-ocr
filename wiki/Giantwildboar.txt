'''Giant wild boars''' are roughly 10 times the size of standard [[wild boar]]s. They appear in groups of 5-10, wandering through various savage [[biome]]s, and may also serve as [[mount]]s during a [[siege]].

Despite the ferocity implied by their name, they retain the [benign] [[creature token|token]] of their smaller cousins, and will generally run away instead of engaging in combat. They are large enough to seriously injure unarmored dwarves if cornered.

Captured giant wild boars can be [[tame]]d and bred as livestock for a [[meat industry]]. Their piglets grow to full size in two years, producing a respectable amount of meat and [[ivory]] tusks as a bonus. As non-[[grazer]]s, they can be conveniently stored in [[cage]]s and small [[pasture]]s while they are growing.

Some dwarves [[preference|admire]] giant wild boars for their ''tusks'' and their ''ferocious charges''.
