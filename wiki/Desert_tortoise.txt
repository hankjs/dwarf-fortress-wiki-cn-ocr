'''Desert tortoises''' are small [[creature]]s found in [[desert]] [[biome]]s. They spawn individually and do little but wander around aimlessly. They are only slightly bigger than the average [[cat]] and will run away when threatened, making them harmless to all but the most unlucky of [[dwarves]]. They are one of the few sources of [[shell]]s in deserts, and the only one when there's no [[water]] available.

Desert tortoises can be captured in [[cage]] [[trap]]s and [[Animal trainer|trained]] into low-value [[pet]]s. They produce a meager amount of [[food]] and [[bone]]s when [[butcher]]ed, and lay a low number of [[egg]]s compared to most domestic poultry. As expected from tortoises, they are quite long-lived, making them long lasting companions for dwarves who adopt them. 

Some dwarves [[Preferences|like]] desert tortoises for their ''shells'' and their ''longevity''.
