'''Beavers''' are [[creature]]s found in [[temperate]] [[lake]]s and [[river]]s, where they appear in groups of 3-10 individuals. Comparable in [[size]] to [[kobold]]s, beavers are benign meanderers who are more likely to flee from [[Dwarf|dwarves]] than provoke them. They possess thick fur which provides them with increased insulation compared to most other animals. A newborn beaver is called a ''kit''.

Beavers can be captured in [[cage]] [[trap]]s and [[Animal trainer|trained]] into cheap [[Exotic pet|exotic]] [[pet]]s. They provide a fair amount of returns when [[butcher]]ed and live for up to two decades, making a beaver farm a potential proposition for your [[meat industry]]. Fortunately or unfortunately, beavers in ''Dwarf Fortress'' do not actually build dams.

Some dwarves [[Preferences|like]] beavers for their ''dams'' and their ''tree-felling habits''.
