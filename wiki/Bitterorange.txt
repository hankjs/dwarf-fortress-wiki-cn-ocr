'''Bitter orange''' is one of the many genera of trees found above-ground. Like the vast majority of above-ground trees, bitter orange [[wood]] is brown and produces brown products.

Bitter orange trees bear '''bitter oranges''' that can be harvested by setting up a gathering [[zone]].

Some [[Dwarf|dwarves]] [[Preferences|like]] bitter orange trees for their ''fruit''.
