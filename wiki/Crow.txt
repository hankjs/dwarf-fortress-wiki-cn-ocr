'''Crows''' are a species of [[above ground]] [[vermin]] who inhabit a variety of [[temperate]] [[biome]]s, as well as [[taiga]]s. They may be captured in [[animal trap]]s and turned into [[pet]]s. All crows possess Legendary [[skill]] in [[Climber|climbing]].

Some dwarves [[Preferences|like]] crows for their ''intelligence''.
