'''Brown recluse spiders''' are [[hateable]] [[vermin]] that, on top of giving [[thought#Unhappy_Thoughts|unhappy thoughts]] to [[Dwarf|dwarves]] who detest them, are very [[syndrome|venomous]]. Brown recluse spider bites cause immediate nausea, fever, and pain, and a short time later result in severe localized necrosis. They are also much faster than your average [[rat]]. Thankfully, the spiders don't seek the vicinity of dwarven settlements and even when a dwarf encounters a spider, this will almost never result in a bite. 

Brown recluse spiders spin webs which can be collected by [[weaver]]s for the production of [[silk]]. In their native biomes, brown recluse spider silk can be an important resource of the [[textile industry]]. 

Some dwarves [[Preferences|like]] brown recluse spiders for their ''venomous bite''.
