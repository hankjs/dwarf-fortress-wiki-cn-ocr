'''Clownfish''' are [[vermin]]-sized fish that can be caught by [[fisherdwarf|fisherdwarves]] and processed at a [[fishery]]. They are found in [[biome|tropical]] [[ocean]]s and can be caught year round. 

While [[dwarves]] have an even chance of catching males or females, this is not the case in real life. In real life, the clownfish sex ratio is not even, since all clownfish are born male, becoming female later on. A colony of clownfish living around an anemone is comprised mainly of males, with only the most dominant fish being female. When the clan matriarch dies, the most dominant male changes its gender and becomes the new matriarch.

Some dwarves [[Preferences|like]] clownfish for their ''coloration''.

It is said that a brave clownfish named Marlin once fought the entire [[ocean]] to find his [[children|son]], defeating [[great white shark|three]] [[hammerhead shark|deadly]] [[longfin mako shark|sharks]] and a swarm of [[sea nettle jellyfish|jellyfish]]. However, he wasn't much of a [[comedian]] and his [[Adventurer mode#Companions|companion]] had poor [[Attribute#Memory|memory]].
