'''Alpacas''' are common [[Domestic animal|domestic livestock]] available to [[dwarf]] and [[human]] [[civilization]]s. They can be [[shearer|sheared]] once every 300 days to yield [[wool]], which can be used to make low-value [[cloth]]. In addition to the standard [[meat industry]] products, alpacas also supply wool when [[butcher]]ed. Alpaca wool is equivalent in value to the wool of all other shearable creatures.

As [[grazer]]s, alpacas require a moderately-sized [[pasture]] to survive; however they eat far less grass than [[cow|cattle]], and make an excellent base animal for combined meat, cheese, and cloth industries. Female alpacas can be milked, and that [[milk]] can then be [[cook]]ed or made into [[cheese]].

Some dwarves [[preference|like]] alpacas for their ''long necks'', their ''jutting teeth'', their ''wool'', and their ''resemblance to a miniature [[llama]]''.

== In real life ==

In real life, alpacas are bred and kept for their highly valuable wool, which is prized for its softness and color. It is commonly referred to as "The fiber of the Gods" due to its silk-like feeling.
