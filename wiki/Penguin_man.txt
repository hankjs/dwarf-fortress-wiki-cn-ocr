'''Penguin men''' are humanoid versions of the common [[penguin]] and a [[Creature|species]] of unremarkable [[animal people]], found in [[savage]] arctic [[ocean]]s. They are only a little over half the size of an adult [[dwarf]], and as such are unlikely to pose a threat to a civilian's life.

Like other savage animal people, penguin men may occasionally join [[civilization]]s, becoming full-fledged citizens who may appear in your fortress as [[visitor]]s or be playable in [[adventurer mode]].

Some dwarves [[Preferences|like]] penguin men for their ''coloration'', their ''waddling gait'', and their ''way of flying through the water''.

<!-- Reference: "Penguin" villain, AKA Oswald Cobblepot, from DC Comics' Batman -->
It has been rumored that one penguin man has been seen in a tuxedo, wearing a top hat and an umbrella. Rumor has it that he lives in the sewers, with a bunch of [[demon|clowns]] and many [[penguin]]s.  He is the nemesis of a certain [[bat man]].

Penguin men tend to show an aversion to windows (gem or glass) and apples.
