'''Orioles''' are a type of [[above ground]] [[vermin]] found in [[temperate]] broadleaf [[forest]]s year-round. They may be captured in [[animal trap]]s and turned into [[pet]]s. All orioles possess Legendary [[skill]] in [[Climber|climbing]].

Some dwarves [[Preferences|like]] orioles for their ''coloration''.
