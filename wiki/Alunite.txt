'''Alunite''' is a [[magma-safe]] [[stone]] found in [[igneous extrusive layer|igneous extrusive]] and [[kaolinite]] [[stone layers]] in [[vein|cluster]]s. Aside from its potential applicability in controlling [[magma]], alunite is entirely unremarkable and has the same value as every other common stone.
