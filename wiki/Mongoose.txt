'''Mongooses''' are small [[creature]]s found in [[tropical]] [[shrubland]]s and [[savanna]]s, where they appear one at a time. While carnivorous, they're timid and benign as well as smaller than your average [[cat]], making them harmless to a [[dwarf]] or just about anything. A newborn mongoose is called a ''pup''.

Mongooses can be captured in [[cage]] [[trap]]s and [[Animal trainer|trained]] into low-value exotic [[pet]]s. They give a low amount of returns if [[butcher]]ed, making them subpar in a [[meat industry]]; there are far better options available.

Some dwarves [[Preferences|like]] mongooses for their ''cunning'' and their ''agility''.
