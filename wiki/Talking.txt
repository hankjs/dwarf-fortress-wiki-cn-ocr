|}

Now that you know how to kill people, you may also want to know how to talk to and otherwise interact with them in a less-violent manner - while this is less entertaining, it can sometimes be useful.

To begin a conversation, press {{Adv menu icon|k}}. Select the creature you would like to have a conversation with using the cursor. Aside from individuals, you can also {{DFtext|Shout out to everybody}}, which will have you talking with everyone in earshot, or talk to your [[deity]], or even {{Adv menu icon|P}} {{DFtext|Begin Performance}}  which includes such things as reciting poetry, telling stories or dancing, and is very important if you want to be a bard. Additionally, you can {{DFtext|Assume an identity}} from the {{Adv menu icon|k}} menu, potentially changing your [[reputation]].

Whenever you want to advance the conversation, you have to press {{Adv menu icon|k}} again and choose the ongoing conversation you wish to continue. You will also see ongoing conversations from people who have started a conversation with you. If you want to talk to someone else during this time, simply {{DFtext|Start a new conversation}}.

* {{DFtext|Greet listener}} — Has you offering a greeting to someone, when you're initiating the conversation. You learn the listener's name.
* {{DFtext|Bypass greeting (new menu)}} — Skips the greeting, taking you straight to the normal conversation menus. You don't learn the listener's name, e.g. the greasy-haired human. 
* {{DFtext|Reply to greeting}} — If you aren't the one who started the conversation, this option will let you reply to someone's greeting. They will then talk about some trouble.
* {{DFtext|Refuse conversation}} — Causes you to explicitly refuse to talk to someone who started a conversation with you. Unknown if this has a different effect from simply not doing anything.{{Verify}}
* {{DFtext|Reply to greeting (impersonation)}} — Like {{DFtext|Reply to greeting}}, except you're impersonating a deity.
* {{DFtext|Nevermind}} — This has you back out of having a conversation.

The game shows the listener's attitude towards you in the upper-right corner. A good joke or compliment can ease tension, though a bad one might make things worse - try to get on their good side before asking them difficult questions. If you pester them too much, they may refuse to speak with you, saying "I must take my leave." Fortunately, deities don't seem to care if you blabber at them incessantly.

When you start talking to someone, you are presented with a wide array of things to talk about. (If the person you are talking to started the conversation and told you about some trouble, you'll first get a menu related to that trouble. Just press {{k|-}}-{{k|Enter}} to {{DFtext|Change the subject (new menu)}} to get to this first menu.) Your choices are as follows:

{| class="wikitable" style="border:1px solid #ccc;"
