'''Chinchillas''' are tiny [[creature]]s who can be found inhabiting [[mountain]]s. They are benign and among the smallest animals in the game who aren't [[vermin]], making them entirely harmless to [[Dwarf|dwarves]]. Because they're so small, trying to attack them may cause most blows to glance away harmlessly, though the force of the attacks will often be enough to kill them. A baby chinchilla is called a ''chinchilla kit''.

Chinchillas can be captured in [[cage]] [[trap]]s and [[Animal trainer|trained]] into [[pet]]s, tied with [[rabbit]]s and [[Cavy|cavies]] as the [[List of creatures by pet value|least valuable]] animals in the game. They are too small to be [[butcher]]ed if hunted, and slaughtering trained ones will only yield a [[skull]] in return. With a lifespan of 10 years or more, they make decent long-term companions to dwarves who adopt them.

Some dwarves [[Preferences|like]] chinchillas for their ''fur''.
