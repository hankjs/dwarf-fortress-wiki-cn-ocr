'''Giant olms''' are much larger cousins of the common [[olm]] who can be commonly found at the first and second layers of the [[caverns]], where they prowl one at a time. These [[creature]]s are over three times heavier than [[Dwarf|dwarves]] and are one of the biggest banes of your [[Fisherdwarf|fisherdwarves]], emerging from the [[water]] and attacking anything smaller than themselves. Giant olms are aggressive and may deal great damage, if not outright kill unarmed civilians, and if they attack near the edge of the water, expect your dwarves to stupidly dodge into it and drown. They may also be seen being [[Mount|ridden]] by [[goblin]]s during [[siege]]s, where they will gleefully swim over any [[moat]] you are using as a defense - whether their riders survive the trek is another story.

Giant olms are Level 1 [[building destroyer]]s and will trample [[furniture]] in their path, including [[door]]s. Because they seek buildings to destroy, they can be easily lured into [[trap]]s. If captured in [[cage]]s, they can either be [[butcher]]ed for a good amount of returns or [[Animal trainer|trained]] into valuable [[pet]]s. Products made from giant olms are [[Item value|worth]] 4 times more than those made from common domestic animals. Unlike olms in real life, giant olms do not lay eggs.

Some dwarves [[Preferences|like]] giant olms for their ''gills''.
