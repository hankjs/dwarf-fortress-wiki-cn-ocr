A '''flail''' is a [[attack types|blunt]] [[weapon]] that consists of a rounded weight attached to a handle by a length of chain. Flails are the same size as a [[morningstar]], but have a contact area twice as large as a much larger [[maul]]. Against soft targets in the [[Creature#Civilized|civilized creature]] size ranges, their large surface area, deep penetration and high velocity modifiers allow them to pulp body parts more easily than many other blunt weapons.

Flails use and train the [[macedwarf]] skill. As foreign weapons, dwarves cannot [[forge]] flails, limiting supply to whatever low-[[quality]] specimens can be traded from human [[caravan]]s and scavenged from invaders. Almost all dwarves can equip flails, though [[Weapon#Size|some must use two hands]].
