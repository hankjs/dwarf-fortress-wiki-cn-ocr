[[File:v50_shrubs_preview.png|right]]A [[shrub]] is a small [[plant]] that grows naturally, as opposed to a domesticated [[farm]] crop.  They can be found all over the world in [[grass]]y areas, [[savanna]]s, [[forest]]s, and [[desert]]s.  They will also sprout on soil and muddy stone underground if a [[cavern]] has been breached.  Shrubs are instrumental for [[plant gathering]], and in environments with a significant amount of [[crop|vegetation]], they can be an excellent supply of food.  Gathering shrubs also serves to provide a supply of [[seed]]s for use in planting surface [[crop]]s, such as [[longland grass]] and [[strawberry|strawberries]].</onlyinclude>
==Harvesting==
Shrubs can be collected by dwarves with the [[plant gathering]] labor enabled in order to produce plant items. Early on, shrubs are an important source of seeds for growing an above ground [[farm plot]]. Harvesting subterranean shrubs grown on a smoothed floor will make the floor rough.{{verify}}

To collect plants, find green, healthy bushes – [[File:blackberry_shrub_sprite.png|30px]] ({{tile|"|2:0:0}}) – rather than the dead or dried-up brown ones – [[File:blackberry_dead_sprite.png]] ({{tile|"|6:0:0}}) – and set plant {{menu icon|g}} gathering orders. Dwarves with the herbalism labor enabled and little else to do will rush out and start trying to gather plants.  Skill is checked for every shrub, similar to a [[quality]] check; [[proficient]] (or higher) herbalists without skill penalties always harvest at least one plant per bush, but the yield is generally lower than from a [[farm]]. <!-- legendary+10 herbalist: avg 4.33 plants/shrub; legendary+10 farmer + 100% potash: avg 5.17 plants/seed; for lower skill the difference is more prominent --> There is usually plenty of available vegetation however, so designate a wide area and leave them to it.
It is also possible to designate a {{menu icon|z}} zone for plant gathering. The herbalist will be triggered every season to gather plants in the designated zone.

Most plants collected from bushes can be brewed or cooked, and some can be used as [[dye]]s. Brewing or eating (but not cooking) plants will produce seeds, which can then be planted on outdoor farms. A [[stockpile]] should be created for storing the collected plants, or they will just be left outside to shrivel up in the sun. A general food stockpile will do, but a custom [[stockpile]] for specific plants will prevent the stockpile filling up with other junk.

==Extra information==
A shrub is a type of map tile, similar to [[tree]]s and [[wall]]s in that they are a tiletype that can be designated for action, such as to be dug out or removed. They only occur naturally but tend to grow up very frequently during the year. All shrubs are clearly identifiable upon examination.

There are also underground shrubs, unlike those found on the surface. In ASCII mode, they appear as color-coded colons rather than green quotation marks – [[File:plump_helmet_shrub_sprite.png]] ({{tile|:|5:0:0}}) for  [[plump helmet]]s, [[File:sweet_pod_shrub_sprite.png]] ({{tile|:|4:0:1}}) for [[sweet pod]]s, [[File:cave_wheat_shrub_sprite.png]] ({{tile|:|7:0:1}}) for [[cave wheat]], [[File:dimple_cup_shrub_sprite.png]] ({{tile|:|1:0:1}}) for [[dimple cup]]s, and [[File:pig_tail_shrub_sprite.png]] ({{tile|:|7:0:0}}) for [[pig tail]]s or [[quarry bush]]es.
