'''Errorlog.txt''' is the log file that stores notifications of any errors encountered by the game, sorted from oldest to newest, and located in the game's root directory. This file is not present in new instances of the game, but rather is automatically created if the game attempts to write something in it, but it doesn't exist yet.
