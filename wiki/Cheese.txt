[[File:cheese_sprite_preview.png|right]]'''Cheese''' is a [[food]] item made from [[milk]] at the [[farmer's workshop]] with the [[cheese making]] labor. It can be eaten as is or cooked into [[prepared meal]]s.

A single "Make cheese" job will take a barrel of milk to the workshop and produce several stacks of cheese of size 5 or less - for example, a barrel containing 17 units of milk will produce 3 stacks of 5 cheese and 1 stack of 2 cheese. A container of frozen milk will, obviously, not be made into cheese. 

The milk of any milk-producing animal can be converted to cheese. With the exception of dwarven cheese, which is made from [[dwarven milk]], all cheeses are priced at the value of 10☼.

{{Translation
| dwarven = shokmug
| elvish  = fetha
| goblin  = ursus
| human   = anig
}}Note that while milk in a barrel won't rot, cheese outside a food [[stockpile]] will.

{{D for Dwarf}}
You are likely acquainted with the dwarven fondness for cheese, but did you know that a dwarf actually invented cheese? She was trying to ferment milk and turn it into a new kind of alcohol, and was quite surprised when she ended up with something else entirely. That's why the dwarven word for cheese is 'shokmug.' She was '''sho'''c'''k'''ed that it couldn't be drunk from a '''mug'''. Meanwhile, the goblin word for cheese is 'ursus', which is a [[Grizzly bear|whole]] [[Black bear|new]] [[Panda|can]] [[Sloth bear|of]] [[Polar bear|worms]].

Some humans have divined a positive correlation between possessing an enormous amount of cheese and enormous amount of friends. 

<!-- ref: The Littlest Cheesemaker -->
Rarely, a migrant may appear with a [[dream]] of creating a [[masterwork]] wheel of cheese.  This is presumably a bug, as cheese currently lacks quality levels.  Since an eternally unfulfilled goal may make the dwarf [[stress|moody]] and prone to [[tantrum]]s, the best solution to the problem is to arrange them an [[unfortunate accident|audience]] with [[vampire|royalty]].
