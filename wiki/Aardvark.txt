'''Aardvarks''' are benign [[creature]]s found in [[tropical]] plains. They spawn individually and meander through the map, minding their own business and fleeing from any potential predators who approach them. Adult aardvarks are nearly as heavy as a [[dwarf]], but they will not fight unless cornered nor do they pose any threat, with [[hunter]]s and poor [[military]] squads making short work of them if needed. Because of their creature name, they appear foremost on several lists, including the create creature list in the [[object testing arena]].

Aardvarks can be captured with [[cage]] [[trap]]s and [[Animal trainer|trained]] into low-value [[pet]]s. A breeding pair can be used for a fortress's [[meat industry]], as they commonly give birth to more than one cub at a time, providing the player with an average amount of [[meat]], [[fat]] and [[bone]]s. Aardvarks reach their full size at 2 years, and should be preferably [[butcher]]ed at that age for optimal product returns.

Some dwarves [[Preferences|like]] aardvarks for their ''snout'' and their ''long ears''.
