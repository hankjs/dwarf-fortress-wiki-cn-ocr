A '''Magma smelter''' is a special variation of the basic [[smelter]] that uses [[magma]] as a source of heat, instead of [[fuel]].

To function, magma smelters must be built with at least one of the eight edge tiles occupying an open space with at least 4/7 magma on the next floor down. This magma can be natural, or channeled from a larger source, or otherwise [[Magma#Bringing magma up|transported from another level]] to a trench designed to hold the magma.

Magma smelters do not consume any magma from their magma source - you can use a single tile of 4/7 (or deeper) magma below the smelter as an infinite heat source.
Note that both [[pig iron]] and [[steel]] production still require either [[coke]] or [[charcoal]] as a part of the recipe, as a source of carbon for the reaction.

Creatures can climb up through the open tile that the building is built on, making them a potential entry point into your fortress. The smelter in older versions had an [[impassable tile]] that could be used to prevent this, but it has been removed as of v50.
