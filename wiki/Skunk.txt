'''Skunks''' are small [[creature]]s found in a number of [[temperate]] [[biome]]s. They are solitary and benign meanderers, who do little but wander around your surroundings aimlessly, which makes them easy target for even the most inexperienced of [[hunter]]s. Unlike in real life, skunks lack any ability to spray stink at people. Young skunks are called ''kits''.

Skunks can be captured in [[cage]] [[trap]]s and [[Animal trainer|trained]] into exotic [[pet]]s. They're smaller than [[cat]]s and provide an equally small amount of returns when [[butcher]]ed, making them poor targets for a [[meat industry]].

Some dwarves [[Preferences|like]] skunks for their ''foul smell'' and their ''distinctive striping''.
