The '''chosen''' is an [[adventurer]] that receives aid and guidance from a patron [[deity]]. It is a successor to the Demigod (now known as Easy) difficulty mode.

== Gameplay ==

The Chosen [[Adventurer mode#Destiny|destiny]] can be selected when creating an adventurer, as long as [[temple]]s have been founded by playable civilizations. It functions as an in-world [[Tutorials|tutorial]], providing guidance specific to each [[world]].

At the beginning of a Chosen's adventure, their patron will instruct them to seek out a [[priest]] of the same [[religion]]. Talking to the priest allows the player to {{Adv menu icon|k}} {{DFtext|Offer service}} and accept a [[quest]] to obtain a [[primordial remnant]] from a [[Mysterious dungeon|mysterious lair]]. To complete the quest, give the [[artifact]] to the priest.

== Abilities ==

Rarely, their patron will deflect an incoming attack via "divine intervention" as if [[Armor#Shield|shielded]], while also [[Status icon|stunning]] the creature, though the circumstances for this event are not well understood.
