'''Smelting''' is the act of refining raw stone [[ore]](s) into useful [[bar]]s of pure metal(s) or alloys. Smelting is similar but distinct from [[Melt_item|melting]], which reclaims existing metal objects back into (fractional) bars. Metal bars produced at a [[smelter]] are usable in a wide variety of goods, from [[weapons]], to [[goblet]]s, to [[furniture]], to [[building]]s. 

Smelting also refines [[bituminous coal]] or [[lignite]] into [[coke]], a [[fuel]] which is equivalent to [[charcoal]], but first needs fuel to do this. Fuel is required to operate a smelter, metalsmith's forge, kiln, or glass furnace, but not their magma-powered equivalents.

Smelting requires the [[ore]] (or coal) to be processed, a [[smelter]], either [[fuel]] or (for [[magma smelter]]s) [[magma]] at least 4/7 deep, and a dwarf with the [[furnace operator]] [[labor]] enabled.  Smelting an ore gives 4 bars of metal, and refining fuel gives 9 bars of coke from [[bituminous coal]] or 5 bars from [[lignite]].  Training in the skill is not necessarily required - since bars have no [[quality]] the only difference is the time the job takes.  

Since smelting coke requires [[fuel]] in a conventional (non-magma) smelter, usually one [[wood]] is burned in a [[wood furnace]], to create one charcoal to start the process. Alternatives are to bring one bar of charcoal or coke with the expedition at embark, [[trade]] for one from [[caravan]]s, or go straight to magma smelters.
