'''Great barracudas''' are a species of [[Creature|fish]] who can be found in [[tropical]] [[ocean]]s, in clusters of 1-3 individuals. As large as a [[dwarf]], they provide a fair amount of returns when [[butcher]]ed. As non-[[vermin]] fish, great barracudas can't be fished by [[Fisherdwarf|fisherdwarves]], but can be caught with the use of a [[drowning chamber]]. Infant great barracudas are called ''great barracuda fry''.

Some dwarves [[Preferences|like]] great barracudas for their ''predatory nature''.
