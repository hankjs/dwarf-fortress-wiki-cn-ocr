'''Elk birds''' are large flightless birds who are among the most common [[creature]]s found in [[caverns]], rivaled only by [[crundle]]s. Though they are generally non-hostile, they will interrupt tasks throughout the [[fortress]] and, if engaged, will usually kill an untrained [[dwarf]] (or even a war [[dog]]) in one-on-one combat. They can also be used as [[mount]]s by [[goblin]] [[siege]]rs. 

In addition to their [[meat]], [[bone]]s, [[Prepared organs|organs]], etc., elk birds will also produce a single [[feather]] and a [[gizzard stone]] when butchered. They are one of the more common creatures that leave gizzard stones. Unlike [[elk]], both genders of elk bird have [[horn]]s. This is nice, because elk bird parts are worth even more than elk parts, with a [[value]] multiplier of three.

[[Animal trainer|Trained]] elk birds require a [[pasture]] to survive. They are notoriously difficult to [[breed]], as an elk bird hen will starve herself to death rather than abandon her [[nest box]]. A well-fed hen can hatch one clutch of eggs before being returned to a nest-box-less pasture to graze; however, infertile eggs or multiple clutches in a row are still problematic.{{bug|4637}} As an alternative to pasture, they can be chained and then fed by idle dwarves with the [[animal caretaker]] labor enabled. They can't be spawned in the [[object testing arena]].

Some dwarves [[Preferences|like]] elk birds for their ''elegant horns''.

<!-- Reference: "Don't Starve" video game -->
Some dwarves claim to have seen baby elk hatchling start to become extremely aggressive when their parents were killed. They seem to have a special self defense maneuver where they spin so fast that they turned into a whirlwind. Then, they charge at their enemy ferociously and then start slapping their enemy rapidly with their wings until they turned into an unrecognizable mass. However, after 10 days of experimenting by ramming the elk bird parents with [[minecart]]s filled with [[Trap component|spike balls]], ironically, the elk bird did not seem to care at all of their parent's brutal death and continues to munch on their [[Grass|cave fungus]] as if nothing happened. Thus, another rumor has been busted by the dwarven [[Scholar|scientists]].
