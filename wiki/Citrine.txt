'''Citrines''' are unremarkable, low-value [[gem]]s that can be found almost anywhere.

==In real life==

Another quartz crystal variation distinguished by color. Also known as a gold or Spanish topaz. Natural occurrence is incredibly rare and restricted to igneous intrusive layers, but it can be manufactured from trash amethyst with heat treatment.
