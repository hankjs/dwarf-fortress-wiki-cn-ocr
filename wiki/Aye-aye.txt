'''Aye-ayes''' are small solitary [[Creature|animals]] uncommonly found in [[tropical]] broadleaf [[forest]]s. Half the size of a [[cat]], they are inoffensive and will flee from any [[dwarf]] who attempts to approach them, and are easily disposed of by even the most inexperienced of [[hunter]]s. While described as nocturnal, their raws are set to being diurnal instead, and as such they're mostly active during the day in [[adventurer mode]]. All aye-ayes are born with Legendary [[skill]] in [[Climber|climbing]].

Aye-ayes can be captured in [[cage]] [[trap]]s and [[Animal trainer|trained]] into cheap exotic [[pet]]s. Due to their small size and rarity, they make poor targets for a [[meat industry]].

Some dwarves [[Preferences|like]] aye-ayes for their ''interesting fingers''.
