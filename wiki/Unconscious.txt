'''Unconscious''' is the state wherein a [[dwarf]] is unable to move or do anything of their own accord.  It's noted under the basic wounds screen ({{k|v}}iew creature -> {{k|w}}ounds).

Dwarves can become unconscious for a variety of reasons, the most common, of course, is that they're [[sleep]]ing. In combat, an injured creature can fall unconscious as well, mostly due to extreme pain from injuries. The amount of pain required to knock out a creature is based on its toughness attribute. [[Syndrome]]s can also cause periodic unconsciousness as one of their symptoms. Unconscious is different from [[Rest]]: dwarves that are unconscious will not heal from their injuries. Very often, attacks that hit bones will cause unconsciousness or worse if they chip a bone, due to the high amount of pain that [[Wound|bone fractures]] cause compared to other tissue.

Anything that falls unconscious can be caught in a [[trap]], including creatures normally [[trapavoid|immune]] to them.  This includes dwarves, who might decide to take their last nap ever on a tile with [[Trap_component|10 Giant Axe Blades]].

If you have a dwarf in a state of endless unconsciousness, if you are able to expel them from your fortress they wake up [Source Needed]
