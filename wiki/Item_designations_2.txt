{{av}}{{Quality|Unrated}}
Some items have characters surrounding the name, which is a way to determine certain properties at a glance. 

== Quality ==

'''Sword''' Ordinary

'''-Sword-''' [[Item quality|Well-crafted]] ''(dashes/hypens)''

'''+Sword+''' [[Item quality|Finely-crafted]] ''(plus signs/addition signs)''

'''*Sword*''' [[Item quality|Superior quality]] ''(asterisks/stars)''

'''≡Sword≡''' [[Item quality|Exceptional]] ''(equivalents/triple equal signs)''

☼'''Sword'''☼ [[Item quality|A masterpiece]] ''(stars/open stars/circle stars)''

See [[Item quality]] for a full explanation of how better qualities improve [[value]] and [[weapon|combat modifiers]].

== Improvement / Decoration ==

'''«Sword»''' Improved or [[Decoration|decorated]] ''(much-less-than and much-greater-than signs/double less-than or greater than signs)''

Decoration can have a quality modifier themselves, leading to combinations such as:

'''*«Sword»*''' Superior improvement/decoration

'''≡«+Sword+»≡''' Exceptional improvement/decoration on a finely-crafted object

'''*«≡Sword≡»*''' Exceptional sword with superior decoration

These quality modifiers can be hidden in [[init.txt]] with [SHOW_IMP_QUALITY:NO].

== Wear ==

'''xSwordx''' ''Showing some [[wear]]'' - worth {{frac|3|4}} ''(surrounded by x's)''

'''XSwordX''' ''Heavily worn'' or ''threadbare'' - worth {{frac|1|2}} ''(surrounded by capital X's)''

'''XXSwordXX''' ''In tatters'' or ''mangled'' - worth {{frac|1|4}} ''(surrounded by double capital XX's)''

== Provenance / Ownership ==

'''(Sword)''' Not produced on-site (imported by [[Trade|traders]] or [[Goblinite|looted]] from [[Siege|raiders]]), does not count towards [[Created wealth|Created Wealth]]. ''(parentheses)''

'''{Sword}''' Unclaimed/[[Forbid|Forbidden]] ''(braces)''

'''$Sword$''' Owned by someone else, either from a [[Trade|trader]] or found in [[Adventure mode]]. Stealing this object will mark the player as a [[thief]].''(dollar signs)''

== Other ==

'''‼Sword‼''' On [[fire]] ''(double exclamation points)''

'''◄Sword►''' [[Magic]]al (as of 51.01 beta) ''(forward and backward triangles)''

==Trivia==
The longest possible item designation is '''‼XX({≡«+Sword+»≡})XX‼''', which designates (reading from the front) that it's on fire ( '''‼''' ), in tatters ( '''XX''' ), imported ( ( ), forbidden ( { ), exceptionally ( ≡ ) decorated ( « ), and of fine quality ( + ).
