'''Aventurines''' are dark green [[gem]]s found in [[sedimentary layer]]s. They are not worth a great deal, only having a [[value]] multiplier of ×3.

==In real life==
Strictly speaking a wider selection of quartzites and feldspars given a metallic sheen by mineral inclusions, ''Dwarf Fortress'' aventurines depict the typical aventurine quartz colored by fuchsite, a variety of [[mica|muscovite]]. It is most often found in India and Norway.
