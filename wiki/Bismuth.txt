'''Bismuth''' is a metal smelted from [[bismuthinite]].  Bismuth bars can normally only be used to make the [[alloy]] bismuth bronze (although [[Strange mood|moody]] dwarves can apparently construct almost anything out of bismuth). 

*1× Bismuth bar + 1× [[Tin]] bar + 2× [[Copper]] bar = 4× [[Bismuth bronze]] bar

You can stud other objects with bismuth, although the option isn't available at the forge, and instead needs to be ordered by the [[manager]].

{{D for Dwarf}}
Some dwarven !!SCIENTISTS!! have hypothesised a combination of elemental bismuth, hydrogen, carbon, and other elements could be used to treat nausea. Experiments on cave-adapted Elf and Human prisoners have proved inconclusive.
