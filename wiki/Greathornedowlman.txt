'''Great horned owl men''' are [[animal people]] variants of the common [[great horned owl]], who inhabit most [[savage]] regions. They spawn in groups of anywhere between 5-10 individuals and are generally content to keep to themselves. In terms of size, they are a little over half the weight of the average [[dwarf]]. All great horned owl men are born with Legendary [[skill]] in [[Climber|climbing]].

Like other savage animal people, great horned owl men can join [[civilization]]s, become [[historical figure]]s, appear as [[visitor]]s and be playable in [[adventurer mode]].

Some dwarves [[Preferences|like]] great horned owl men for their ''ear tufts'' and their ''piercing yellow eyes''.

<!-- Reference: Old 1969 Tootsie Pop commercial -->
Great horned owl men are not able to answer the questions of young humans regarding "how many licks it takes to get to the center of a Tootsie Pop". Although the nature of such an invention is unknown, it is assumed to be a sugary product made by humans.

Rumors of Great horned owl men being evil [[Bat man|Bat men]] from alternate savefiles remain, so far, unconfirmed.
