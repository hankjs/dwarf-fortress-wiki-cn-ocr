'''Ruby''' is a valuable red [[gem]] found in small clusters within [[bauxite]]. A given cluster may also contain a single [[star ruby]]. Aside from the colour, rubies are exactly identical to [[sapphire]]s, including the value and physical characteristics (this implies that rubies are not magma-safe, melting at {{ct|11500}}). Rubies are also exactly identical to star rubies aside from the location and value.

Like all precious and rare gems, they may also make up part of the walls of [[unusual volcanic wall]]s.

==In real life==
"Ruby" is a type of red corundum (aluminum oxide: Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>); any colored corundum besides red is called a [[sapphire]]. Unlike in-game, rubies do '''not''' occur within [[bauxite]] in real life.
