'''Mosquito men''' are humanoid versions of the common [[mosquito]] and a [[Creature|species]] of unremarkable [[animal people]], found in most non-freezing [[savage]] [[biome]]s. They are a little over half the size of [[dwarf|dwarves]] when adults and spawn in groups of 1-3 individuals. They should pose no threat unless provoked. All mosquito men possess Legendary [[skill]] in [[Climber|climbing]].

Like other savage animal people, mosquito men may occasionally join [[civilization]]s, becoming full-fledged citizens who may appear in your fortress as [[visitor]]s or be playable in [[adventurer mode]]. They have 4 arms and 2 legs, allowing an adventurer to wield four items at once, though due to their small size, most weapons will need to be multigrasped with all four hands as to not receive a to-hit penalty. They can also fly, attack while flying and hover in place. Female mosquito people also have a special bite attack that draws a fair bit of blood from the target on hit, which can lead to them acquiring a [[vampire|different]] taste for blood.

Some dwarves [[Preferences|like]] mosquito men for their ''high-pitched buzz'' and their ''ability to feast on blood''.

<!-- Reference: the common perception of lawyers in modern society -->
Also known as lawyers, these parasites can quickly bleed a fortress dry with lawsuits, court fees and general bloodsucking. This makes them ideal test subjects for dwarven science.

<!-- Reference: ??? -->
Curiously, mosquito men will occasionally visit your fort in caravans. However, they have only been observed to offer one [[human]] [[doctor]], two human bandits, and one human wearing a [[steel]] [[Armor#Headgear|mask]] with high physical [[Attribute|attributes]]. While you have to buy the doctor, there is no charge for the other three.

<!-- Reference: ??? -->
Contrary to popular belief, mosquito men are quite small.
