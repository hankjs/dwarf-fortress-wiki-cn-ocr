'''Slabs''' are buildings which serve primarily to commemorate the dead. Unlike [[coffin]]s, slabs do not require any body part of the deceased to function, allowing you to prevent the appearance of [[ghost]]s of dwarves whose bodies are no longer recoverable. Engraved slab [[memorial]]s are usually made for your fort's citizens, but can be made in remembrance of any historical figure which dies on your lands. If a ghost has appeared in a fortress, but a slab commemorating that deceased individual has been placed somewhere, the ghost's spirit will be calmed and disappear. When this happens, the following message appears:<br>
{{DFtext|Urist McGhost, Ghostly Cheesemaker has been put to rest.|5:1}}

A slab must first be constructed at a [[stoneworker's workshop]] from a single [[stone]], and can then be turned into a [[memorial]] at a [[stoneworker's workshop]] (same workshop) by an [[engraver]]. After it has been engraved, you may build the slab using {{menu icon|b|f|l}}. To pick the engraved slab, first open the menu for that material, then search for "memorial" (or just "me"), or the name of the creature.

Built engraved slabs can be read in fortress mode from the stocks screen or by clicking the building, then the details button ([[File:Mag glass icon.png]]) for the item, revealing information on the arrival and death of the creature. If the subject slew any important figures or fortress citizens, this may also be noted on the slab. If you're not sure how a dwarf or creature died, engraving a slab in their memory may reveal the killer.

Slabs, whether blank or engraved, can also be built solely to increase a [[Zone#Quality_and_value|room's value]]. They aren't uniquely valuable, but don't block movement.

== Adventurer mode ==
In [[adventurer mode]], slabs made out of [[wood]] are occasionally used as shop and tavern signs in human [[town]]. They also appear in two particularly interesting places.

[[File:vault_slab_preview.png|thumb|240px|right|A vault slab.]]If you manage to infiltrate or conquer a [[necromancer]]'s [[Tower (necromancy)|tower]], you may find an engraved slab which contains "the secrets of life and death". To read this, you need to pick it up with {{Adv menu icon|g}}, enter advanced interaction menu with {{Adv menu icon|I}}, select the slab, select {{k|a}} to read it, and voila! You can now raise the dead too. Basic [[reader|reading]] [[skill]]s are required to do this, so make sure to start your adventurer with some reading skill.

[[Artifact]] slabs can also be found in [[vault]]s throughout the world. Although extremely well-guarded, you can perform raid [[mission]]s in either mode to capture them and bring them back to your fortress. These slabs contain a different kind of secret, which an adventurer can wield. See the [[Vault]] article for further details.
