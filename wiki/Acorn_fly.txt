'''Acorn flies''' are a type of [[vermin]] which spawn around [[murky pool]]s in [[surroundings|savage]] areas. It may be observed in swarms around [[miasma|rotting]] corpses. Unlike regular [[Fly|flies]], [[dwarves]] do not ever [[Hateable|detest]] acorn flies, though they can be [[thought|mildly annoyed]] by them. Can be caught with "Capture Live Land Animal" job, but can not be trapped in [[building|built]] [[animal trap]]s. All acorn flies possess Legendary [[skill]] in [[Climber|climbing]].

Some dwarves [[Preferences|like]] acorn flies for their ''deafening buzz''.
