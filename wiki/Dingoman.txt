'''Dingo men''' are [[animal people]] variants of the common [[dingo]] who can be found in most [[savage]] [[biome]]s. They spawn in groups of 3-10 individuals and may pick fights with [[dwarves]] who provoke them, inevitably leading to injuries, but most dwarves should be able to defeat a dingo man one-on-one. They are close to dwarves in size, but overall smaller.

Like other savage animal people, they can join [[civilization]]s, become [[historical figure]]s, appear as [[visitor]]s and be playable in [[adventurer mode]].

Some dwarves [[Preferences|like]] dingo men for their ''coloration''.

<!-- Reference: Dingodile from the Crash Bandicoot franchise -->
Despite what some forms of media may portray, there are no dingo men infused with crocodiles at the genetic level. They also do not antagonize humanoid bandicoot men, nor do they operate large flamethrowers. It is debatable whether they speak in an Australian accent or not.
