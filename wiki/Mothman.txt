'''Moth men''' are [[animal people]] variants of the common [[moth]], who can inhabit most [[savage]] [[biome]]s. They spawn in groups of 1-5 individuals and are generally content to keep to themselves, but may pick fights if provoked. In terms of size, they are a little over half the weight of the average [[dwarf]]. All moth men are born with Legendary [[skill]] in [[Climber|climbing]].

Like other savage animal people, moth men can join [[civilization]]s, become [[historical figure]]s, appear as [[visitor]]s and be playable in [[adventurer mode]].

Some dwarves [[Preferences|like]] moth men for their ''coloration''.

<!-- Reference: ? -->
Moth men are not, in fact, any sort of secretive paranormal monster, as dwarves find and kill them on a semiregular basis. The humans are just overreacting.

<!-- Reference: Mothman, from West Virginian folklore -->
Additionally, and contrary to another popular human belief, moth men <i>do not</i> appear as a warning before cave-ins, structural failures or other unfortunate accidents. Warnings of such incidents should only be managed by burrow assignment rather than superstition. Get back to work.

<!-- Reference: ? -->
Some [[human]] peasants have a strange preference for moth women.
