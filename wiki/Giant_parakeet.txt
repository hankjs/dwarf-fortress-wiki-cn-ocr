'''Giant parakeets''' are much larger cousins of their [[parakeet|original counterparts]], and fast moving birds found in any [[tropical]] land [[biome]] except for [[wetland|swamps and marshes]]. They will pose as a nuisance more than a threat, and are likely to cause mass cancellation spam from anyone working above ground. Tight groups of 5-10 will appear, and haphazardly fly around. They will not attack a dwarf on sight, and can be [[attack|dispatched]] by your [[military]] fairly easily. In combat, they can overpower and kill an unarmored dwarf unlucky enough to be caught.  Fortunately, they will not actively pursue a dwarf as it flees, and will often use its large wings, which inflict much less severe injuries than its beak or talons.  

They make a poor choice for your [[egg production|egg industry]], with a clutch size of only 2-4, but a very manageable addition to your [[meat industry]] if bred. It takes only one year for hatchlings to fully mature; however, with a pet value of 500, they may be worth more as pets in your [[zoo]], than as roasts and [[trade good|crafts]]. They are considered exotic animals, and your [[Animal trainer|trainers]] will have no initial knowledge of their habits.
