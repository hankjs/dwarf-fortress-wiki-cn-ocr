'''Rock crystal''', one of many types of quartz crystals (SiO<sub>2</sub>), is a type of [[gem]]. When rough rock crystals are combined with [[pearlash]] at a [[glass furnace]], it can be used to make [[glass|crystal glass]] items.  Cut rock crystals can't be used for this purpose.

Crystal glass is slightly complicated to produce, but has many advantageous uses: it can be cut into gems with five times the material value, made into crafts and furniture that will keep your dwarves happy, and even utilized as a [[magma safe]] building material.
