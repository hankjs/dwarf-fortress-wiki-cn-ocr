{{release notes}}

:Here's a patch with lots of routine fixes. Lots of new portraits and some updated portraits. Small experimental beasts now have their own colorful graphics to match the forgotten beasts. Find details below:

:We heard your feedback about the portraits and updated a bunch of them that were feeling inconsistent with the tone of the game. I'm still getting a hang of making art direction decisions and wasn't as careful as I should have been. So Guido/Neoriceisgood and I talked more about the portrait art and I gave him more time to rework them.
:Although we always welcome feedback, it was disappointing to see disrespectful and disparaging comments directed to Guido/Neoriceisgood who was simply working within the confines of his role. And so I ask that folks be more kind to the dev team in future feedback. I also want to clarify that we do not use generative AI for Dwarf Fortress in any step of development. We make things that make things but we make them by hand.
