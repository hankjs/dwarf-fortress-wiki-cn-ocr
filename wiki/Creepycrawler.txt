'''Creepy crawlers''' are a type of [[evil]] subterranean [[vermin]]. They are found in deep [[caverns]], and may spawn near [[miasma|rotting]] [[food]]. They can be captured by [[trapper]]s and turned into low-value [[pet]]s. When the cavern layer they inhabit is breached, they'll begin appearing on the surface, typically wandering on top of [[food]] or [[refuse]] stockpiles.

Unlike all other vermin, creepy crawlers can be butchered for a small amount of [[meat]] and organs (due to ''not'' having {{token|NOT_BUTCHERABLE|c}}, {{token|MILKABLE|c}}, or {{token|CAN_LEARN|c}}). Live creepy crawlers, captured by [[trapper]]s in [[animal trap]]s, are automatically lined up for slaughter at a butchery, but only if they have not been tamed yet. If killed, e.g. by a [[cat]], only unusable [[remains]] will be left over.

Some [[dwarves]] [[Preferences|like]] creepy crawlers for their ''freakish wriggling''.
