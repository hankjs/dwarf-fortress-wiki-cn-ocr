'''Two-humped camel men''' are humanoid versions of the common [[two-humped camel]] and a [[Creature|species]] of [[animal people]], found in [[savage]] [[desert]]s. They are nearly 5 times bigger than [[dwarf|dwarves]] when adults and spawn in groups of 5-10 individuals, and as such make potentially dangerous opponents if provoked. Funnily enough, only 5-10 of them may exist in a single area before they're considered [[extinct]], so you might witness your map's entire population of camel men pass by your fort all in one go.

Like other savage animal people, two-humped camel men may occasionally join [[civilization]]s, becoming full-fledged citizens, who may appear in your fortress as [[visitor]]s or be playable in [[adventurer mode]].

As the animal person template does not remove it, two-humped camel women produce [[milk]].

Some dwarves [[Preferences|like]] two-humped camel men for their ''humps''.
