'''Honey bees''' are a type of [[vermin]] found in any area that isn't freezing, and can spawn after embark, even if not originally present. They appear in naturally made hives ( [[File:natural_hive_sprite.png|x22px]] ). Their wild colonies can be transferred into artificial [[hive]]s and used in the [[beekeeping industry]] producing [[royal jelly]], [[honey]] and [[wax]] as end products. They can sting a nearby [[dwarf]] or [[animal]], resulting in the death of the bee, and causing slight pain but no negative [[thought]] for the dwarf. This sometimes results in the Recover Wounded task, which may actually give a good thought to the stung dwarf.

There are often tens of thousands inside mature hives. They are not killed by cats, but they can fill up your refuse stockpile if dwarves are regularly stung by them.

Some dwarves [[Preferences|like]] honey bees for their ''busy nature'', their ''buzzing'', and their ''ability to organize''.

<!-- Reference: "Bee Movie" animated film in which the main character at one point asks, "ya like jazz?" -->
Despite common belief, bees do not like jazz.
