'''Giant raccoons''' are much bigger, more problematic versions of the regular [[raccoon]]. They're the size of a [[grizzly bear]], and enjoy [[steals food|stealing fortresses' food]] and [[steals items|finished goods]]. 

Some dwarves [[Preferences|like]] giant raccoons for their ''cunning''.

==Combat==
While an unarmed civilian is likely to be killed by a giant raccoon, a few well-trained dwarves should be able to kill one of these animals. As a result, giant raccoons aren't really much of a threat once a good [[military]] and good defenses are set up.

==Trading==
Elves will occasionally offer them as exotic pets.
