The '''furnace operator''' skill is used for [[furnace]] tasks, such as melting metal ores into bars, [[melt]]ing metal items and creating metal [[alloy]]s. It is also used at [[kiln]]s for creating [[pearlash]] and [[Gypsum_plaster|plaster powder]]. Having higher skill levels does not improve the output in any way; it only allows the task to be performed faster. Graphically, furnace operators wear dark grey clothes.

[[wood burner|Wood burning]] is a separate labor, used to make [[fuel]] from [[wood]].
