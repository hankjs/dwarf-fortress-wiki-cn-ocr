'''Pearlash''' is a [[wood industry|wood-based]] product which is used primarily in the manufacture of clear and crystal [[glass]].

==Producing pearlash==
Pearlash can be created at a [[kiln]] or [[magma kiln]] by a dwarf with the [[furnace operator]] labor enabled. Doing so requires one unit of [[potash]], as well as whatever [[fuel]] is necessary to run the kiln. Pearlash is actually one of the most labor intensive products in the game to produce, requiring you to burn one unit of [[wood]] to [[ash]] at a [[wood furnace]], then convert the ash to [[potash]] at an [[ashery]] just to acquire the input material used in its creation.

Pearlash is produced in [[bar]]s with no quality level. These bars can be stored in bar [[stockpile]]s, and are viewable in the stocks screen under "bars."

==Uses==
Pearlash's sole use is to allow the production of clear glass (also requires [[sand]]) and crystal glass (also requires [[rock crystal]]) at a [[glass furnace]] or [[magma glass furnace]].

==Real world==
[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pearlash Pearlash] (or salt of tartar) is a more refined form of potash. Historically, this fine white powder was produced by burning away potash's impurities in a kiln. It was used in glassmaking, china, breadmaking, and soap production, and has many widespread uses today.
