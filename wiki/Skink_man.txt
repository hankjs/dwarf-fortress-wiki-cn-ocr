'''Skink men''' are humanoid versions of the common [[skink]] and a [[Creature|species]] of unremarkable [[animal people]], found in a variety of [[savage]] regions. They are a bit over half the size of [[dwarf|dwarves]] when adults and  should pose no threat unless provoked. They spawn in groups of 1-5 individuals. All skink men are born with Legendary [[skill]] in [[Climber|climbing]].

Like other savage animal people, skink men may occasionally join [[civilization]]s, becoming full-fledged citizens who may appear in your fortress as [[visitor]]s or be playable in [[adventurer mode]].

Some dwarves [[Preferences|like]] skink men for their ''colorful tongues''.
