{{DFtext|Dwarf cancels Construct Building: Cannot reach site.}}

This error message will show if a [[dwarf]] is unable to find a valid path to the [[construction]] site. You may want to check if the site is blocked in some way, such as on an unreachable z-level, across a body of [[water]], or blocked in by [[wall]]s or structures. Raising or retracting a [[bridge]] may lead to many of these messages.  Alternatively, the dwarf that generated the message may be stuck themselves. Make sure they have not walled themselves in or have gotten stuck in some other way.

This error may also occur if a dwarf refuses to move an obstructing object in a diagonal corridor. You can manually order the object moved, then finish the construction - this behavior is presumably a bug.{{bug|8879}}
