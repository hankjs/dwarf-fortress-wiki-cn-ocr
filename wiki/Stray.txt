'''Stray''' is a designation assigned to domesticated [[animals]] that have not been granted a name. All creatures that can be [[animal training|tamed]] can theoretically be domesticated, though this can only happen during initial world generation. Unlike tamed creatures, domesticated animals do not require constant training and will never revert to wild status.

Stray animals may be marked as available for adoption; dwarves may then choose these creatures for [[pet]]s. Any creature so chosen will be given a name by the adopting dwarf, and will no longer be identified as "stray". Stray animals that perform heroic actions (such as striking down a [[titan]]) may also receive a name, ending their identification as strays. Stray animals can also be used as an early-warning system/rudimentary defense for your fortress.

Stray animals can be freely assigned to [[cage]]s and [[slaughter]]ed, unlike pets, making them valuable to a [[meat industry]]. However, strays that die in any way other than a slaughter task cannot be butchered.

In [[adventure mode]], stray animals can be used as [[pet]]s, and some as [[mount]]s or [[Creature_token#PACK_ANIMAL|pack animals]].
