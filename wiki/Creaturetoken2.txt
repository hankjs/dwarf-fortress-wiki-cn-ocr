The <code>[OBJECT:CREATURE]</code> [[token]] begins the definition of a ''Dwarf Fortress'' [[creature]] [[raw file]]. Each creature definition that follows begins with the {{token|creature|c|creature ID}} token, and the creature's exact properties and behavior are then specified by the use of further creature tokens.  All known creature tokens are listed below. 

Vanilla creature definitions can be found in <code>[[Game folder|<Dwarf Fortress>]]\data\vanilla\vanilla_creatures\</code>. 
Creature ID is also used with [[graphics token]]s to make customizable [[graphics set]]s.

The [[caste]] tokens allow defining sub-species within the broader creature definition, including true biological castes and lesser variations, such as sexes. Creature tokens can either be 'Creature' or 'CASTE-only' type which can only be applied to creature or caste respectively, or 'CASTE' which can be applied to both. In the table bellow, creature type distinguishes tokens that can be applied to creature only, caste only, and both ('creature', 'CASTE-only', and 'CASTE' respectively)

! width="10%" | Type
! width="20%" | Arguments
! width="50%" | Description
|-| {{text anchor|ADOPTS_OWNER}}| Caste|| Prevents the tamed creature from being made available for adoption, instead allowing it to automatically adopt whoever it wants. The basic requirements for adoption are intact, and the creature will only adopt individuals who have a [[preference]] for their species. Used by [[cat]]s in the vanilla game. When {{k|v}}iewing a tame creature with this token, the message "This animal isn't interested in your wishes" will appear instead of "This [adorable] animal can't work" or "This animal is waiting to be trained".
|-| {{text anchor|ALCOHOL_DEPENDENT}}| Caste|  | Makes the creature need [[alcohol]] to get through the working day; it will choose to drink booze instead of [[water]] if possible. Going sober for too long reduces speed.
|-| {{text anchor|ALL_ACTIVE}}| Caste|  | When set, the creature will appear at any time of day. Overrides {{token|DIURNAL|c}}, {{token|NOCTURNAL|c}}, {{token|CREPUSCULAR|c}}, {{token|MATUTINAL|c}}, and {{token|VESPERTINE|c}}.
|-| {{text anchor|ALTTILE}}| Creature| 
*'character' or tile number| If set, the creature will blink between its {{token|TILE|c}} and its ALTTILE. 
|-| {{text anchor|AMBUSHPREDATOR}}| Caste|  | Makes the creature start out hidden and remain near its original location until its prey draws near. When combined with {{token|WEBBER|c}}, causes them to lay gigantic webs near their spawn location, though only for creatures present during embark.
|-| {{text anchor|AMPHIBIOUS}}| Caste|  | Allows a creature to breathe both in and out of [[water]] (unlike {{token|AQUATIC|c}}) - does not prevent drowning in [[magma]].
|-| {{text anchor|APP_MOD_DESC_RANGE}}| Appearance Modifier|
*Range (6 values, low to high)| Based on info from [http://www.bay12forums.com/smf/index.php?topic=113762.msg3473069#msg3473069 Wannabehero on the forums]: When used with an appearance modifier token (BP_APPEARANCE_MODIFIER or BODY_APPEARANCE_MODIFIER), tells the game what numeric ranges to map to which descriptors.

The game uses 7 descriptor levels for each modifier, with the center one generally being to omit the thing from the creature description entirely. The six values in APP_MOD_DESC_RANGE define the boundaries between each described range. If this is not specified it uses the numbers 10:50:95:105:150:190.
|-| {{text anchor|APP_MOD_GENETIC_MODEL}}| Appearance Modifier|
*Model (Accepts DOMINANT_MORE, DOMINANT_LESS, and MIX)| Defines a genetic model for the relevant appearance modifier(s). May or may not do anything significant at present.
|-| {{text anchor|APP_MOD_IMPORTANCE}}| Appearance Modifier|
*number| Determines how important the appearance modifier is, for determining whether it shows up in the creature description.{{verify}}
|-| {{text anchor|APP_MOD_NOUN}}| Appearance Modifier| 
*noun
*SINGULAR or PLURAL | Creates a noun for the appearance, and whether it is singular or plural.
|-| {{text anchor|APP_MOD_RATE}}| Appearance Modifier| 
*Rate (integer)
*Scale (DAILY, YEARLY)
*min (growth)
*max (growth)
*start year
*start day
*end year
*end day | Setting the growth rate of the modifier. The last two tokens can be replaced by NO_END to have growth continue indefinitely.
|-| {{text anchor|APPLY_CREATURE_VARIATION}}| Caste| 
*creature variation ID
*(optional) any amount of arbitrary arguments| Applies the specified [[creature variation token|creature variation]]. See [[Creature_variation_token#Arguments_and_conditional_tokens]] for how the subsequent arguments may be used.
|-| {{text anchor|APPLY_CURRENT_CREATURE_VARIATION}}| Special|  | Applies the effects of all pending {{token|CV_ADD_TAG|c}} and {{token|CV_REMOVE_TAG|c}} tokens that have been defined in the current creature.
|-| {{text anchor|AQUATIC}}| Caste|  | Enables the creature to breathe in water, but causes it to air-drown on dry land. 
|-| {{text anchor|ARENA_RESTRICTED}}| Caste|  | Causes the creature to be excluded from the [[object testing arena]]'s creature spawning list.  Typically applied to spoileriffic creatures.
|-| {{text anchor|ARTIFICIAL_HIVEABLE}}| Creature|| Enables the creature to be kept in artificial [[hive]]s by [[beekeeper]]s.
|-| {{text anchor|AT_PEACE_WITH_WILDLIFE}}| Caste|| Prevents the creature from attacking or frightening creatures with the {{Token|NATURAL|c}} tag.
|-| {{text anchor|ATTACK}}| Caste| 
*token
*selection criteria (it's complicated)| Defines the attack name, and the body part used. See [[#Attack Tokens|below]] for valid subtokens
'''Example:'''<br />
<code>[ATTACK:GORE:BODYPART:BY_CATEGORY:HORN]</code><br />
''GORE'' = name of the attack<br />
''BODYPART:BY_CATEGORY:HORN'' = the horn is used to attack (presuming the creature has one)
|-| {{text anchor|ATTACK_TRIGGER}}| Caste| 
*population
*exported wealth
*created wealth| Specifies when a [[megabeast]] or [[semi-megabeast]] will attack the fortress. The attacks will start occurring when all of the requirements are met. Setting a value to 0 disables the trigger.

! width="50%" | Description
|-| {{text anchor|BABY}}| Caste| 
*integer | Age at which creature is considered a child, the default is zero. One can think of this as the duration of the baby stage.
|-| {{text anchor|BABYNAME}}| Caste| 
*singular
*plural | Defines a new name for a creature in baby state at the caste level. For non-caste-specific baby names, see {{token|GENERAL_BABY_NAME|c}}.
|-| {{text anchor|BEACH_FREQUENCY}}| Caste| 
*integer| Creature may be subject to [[beaching]], becoming stranded on [[Beach|shores]], where they will eventually air-drown. The number indicates the frequency of the occurrence. Presumably requires the creature to be {{token|AQUATIC|c}}. Used by [[orca]]s, [[sperm whale]]s and [[sea nettle jellyfish]] in the vanilla game.
|-| {{text anchor|BENIGN}}| Caste|  | The creature is non-aggressive by default, and will never automatically be engaged by companions or soldiers, running away from any creatures that are not friendly to it, and will only defend itself if it becomes enraged. Can be thought of as the counterpoint of the {{token|LARGE_PREDATOR|c}} tag. When tamed, animals with this tag will be useless for fortress defense.

This and {{token|TRADE_CAPACITY|c}} are required for {{token|PACK_ANIMAL|c}} to function properly, if an animal contains the aforementioned requirements without this tag: items loaded by the merchants will be dropped upon departure.
|-| {{text anchor|BIOME}}| Creature| 
* [[biome token]]| Select a [[biome]] the creature may appear in.
|-| {{text anchor|BLOOD}}| Caste| 
* <[[material token]]>
* <[[Material_definition_token#Material_States|material state]]>| Specifies what the creature's blood is made of.
|-| {{text anchor|BLOODSUCKER}}| Caste| | Causes [[vampire]]-like behaviour; the creature will suck the [[Creature_token#BLOOD|blood]] of unconscious victims when its [[Syndrome#TIME_SINCE_SUCKED_BLOOD|thirst for blood]] grows sufficiently large. When controlling the creature in adventure mode, this can be done at will. Seems to be required to make the creature denouncable (in-world) as a creature of the night.
|-| {{text anchor|BODY}}| Caste| 
*body parts | Draws body parts from OBJECT:BODY files (such as body_default.txt)
'''Example:'''<br />
[BODY:BODY_WITH_HEAD_FLAG:HEART:GUTS:BRAIN:MOUTH] <br />
This is the body from a [[purring maggot]]. It creates a body with head, a heart, some guts, a brain, and a mouth. That's all a maggot needs.

The body parts need to be listed in an order such that any parent part appears before its connected children. For example [BODY:HEART:BODY_WITH_HEAD_FLAG] produces a "Body Token Recognized But Could Not Connect: HEART" error because HEART can't find any UPPERBODY(s) to connect to. Switching the order to [BODY:BODY_WITH_HEAD_FLAG:HEART] fixes the problem because now the UPPERBODY is created before the HEART tries to connect to it.

'''If the body is left undefined, the creature (or caste) will be tagged as [DOES_NOT_EXIST].''' {{verify}}
|-| {{text anchor|BODY_APPEARANCE_MODIFIER}}| Caste| 
*ATTRIBUTE
*lowest
*lower
*low
*median
*high
*higher
*highest | These body modifiers give individual creatures different characteristics. In the case of HEIGHT, BROADNESS and LENGTH, the modifier is also a percentage change to the BODY_SIZE of the individual creature. The seven numbers afterward give a distribution of ranges. Each interval has an equal chance of occurring.
'''Example:'''<br />
[BODY_APPEARANCE_MODIFIER:HEIGHT:90:95:98:100:102:105:110] <br />
''HEIGHT'' : marks the height to be changed <br />
''90:95:98:100:102:105:110'' : sets the range from the shortest (90% of the average height) to the tallest (110% of the average height) creature variation.
|-| {{text anchor|BODY_DETAIL_PLAN}}| Caste| 
*PlanName
*Arguments | Loads a plan from listed OBJECT:BODY_DETAIL_PLAN files, such as b_detail_plan_default.txt. Mass applies USE_MATERIAL_TEMPLATE, mass alters RELSIZE, alters body part positions, and will allow tissue layers to be defined. Tissue layers are defined in order of skin to bone here.
'''Example:'''<br />
[BODY_DETAIL_PLAN:VERTEBRATE_TISSUE_LAYERS:SKIN:FAT:MUSCLE:BONE:CARTILAGE] <br />
This creates the detailed body of a [[fox]], the skin, fat, muscle, bones and cartilage out of the vertebrate tissues.<br />
A [[Purring maggot|maggot]] would only need:<br />
''[BODY_DETAIL_PLAN:EXOSKELETON_TISSUE_LAYERS:SKIN:FAT:MUSCLE]'' 
|-| {{text anchor|BODY_SIZE}}| Caste| 
*years
*days
*size | Sets size at a given age. Size is in cubic centimeters, and for normal body materials, is roughly equal to the creature's average weight in grams.
'''Example:'''<br />
[BODY_SIZE:0:0:10000]<br />
[BODY_SIZE:1:168:50000]<br />
[BODY_SIZE:12:0:220000]<br />
This describes the size of a [[minotaur]]. Its birth size would be 10,000 cm<sup>3</sup> (~10 kg). At 1 year and 168 days old it would be 50,000 cm<sup>3</sup> (~50 kg). And as an adult (at 12 years old) it would be 220,000 cm<sup>3</sup> and weigh roughly 220 kg.
|-| {{text anchor|BODYGLOSS}}| Caste| 
*gloss | Substitutes body part text with replacement text. Draws gloss information from OBJECT:BODY files (such as body_default.txt)
|-| {{text anchor|BONECARN}}| Caste|  | Creature eats bones. Implies {{token|CARNIVORE|c}}.  Currently does not work due to a bug ({{Bug|11069}}).
|-| {{text anchor|BP_ADD_TYPE}}| Caste| | Adds a type to a body part - used with {{token|SET_BP_GROUP|c}}. In vanilla DF, this is used for adding the type '[[Body token#GELDABLE|GELDABLE]]' to the lower body of certain [[cat|creatures]]. 
|-| {{text anchor|BP_APPEARANCE_MODIFIER}}| Caste| 
*QUALITY
*lowest
*lower
*low
*median
*high
*higher
*highest | Sets up the breadth of possibilities for appearance qualities for a selected BP group. EG. Eyes (CLOSE_SET, DEEP_SET, ROUND_VS_NARROW, LARGE_IRIS),Lips (THICKNESS), Nose (BROADNESS, LENGTH, UPTURNED, CONVEX), Ear (SPLAYED_OUT, HANGING_LOBES, BROADNESS, HEIGHT), Tooth (GAPS), Skull (HIGH_CHEEKBONES, BROAD_CHIN, JUTTING CHIN, SQUARE_CHIN), Neck (DEEP_VOICE, RASPY_VOICE), Head (BROADNESS, HEIGHT)
|-| {{text anchor|BP_REMOVE_TYPE}}| Caste| | Removes a type from a body part. Used with {{token|SET_BP_GROUP|c}}. 
 |-| {{text anchor|BUILDINGDESTROYER}}| Caste| 
*1 or 2 | Allows a creature to destroy furniture and buildings. Value [1] targets mostly doors, hatches, furniture and the like. Value [2] targets anything not made with the {{k|b}} + {{k|C}} commands. |}

|-| {{text anchor|CAN_DO_INTERACTION}}| Caste| 
*interaction token| The creature can perform an interaction. See [[interaction token]].
|-| {{text anchor|CAN_LEARN}}| Caste|  | The creature gains [[skill]]s and can have [[labor|professions]]. If a member of a civilization (even a pet) has this token, it'll need to eat, drink and sleep. Note that this token makes the creature unable to be eaten by an adventurer, so it is not recommended for uncivilized monsters. Adventurers lacking this token can allocate but not increase attributes and skills. Skills allocated will disappear on start. A creature with at least this token or the {{token|CAN_SPEAK|c}} token will be able to have [[Personality value|values]] and [[Personality goal|goals]].
|-| {{text anchor|CAN_SPEAK}}| Caste|  | Can [[talking|talk]]. Note that this is not necessary for a creature to gain social skills but to make friends in fortress mode. A creature with at least this token or the {{token|CAN_LEARN|c}} token will be able to have [[Personality value|values]] and [[Personality goal|goals]].
|-| {{text anchor|CANNOT_CLIMB}}| Caste|  | Creature cannot [[climber|climb]], even if it has free grasp parts.
|-| {{text anchor|CANNOT_JUMP}}| Caste|  | Creature cannot [[jump]].

*singular
*plural
*adjective | While {{token|NAME|c}} describes the name of the species, {{token|CASTE_NAME|c}} names individuals of the species. Unlike other caste-specific descriptions, this token is required, even for creatures without separate castes. If left undefined, the creature will not show up in the [[arena]] and members of the species will be labeled as "nothing".

|-| {{text anchor|CDI}}| Caste| 
*Varies| Specifies interaction details following a {{token|CAN_DO_INTERACTION|c}} token. See [[interaction token]].
|-| {{text anchor|CHANGE_BODY_SIZE_PERC}}| Caste| 
*integer| Multiplies body size by a factor of (integer)%. 50 halves size, 200 doubles.
|-| {{text anchor|CHANGE_FREQUENCY_PERC}}| Creature| 
*integer| Multiplies frequency by a factor of (integer)%.
|-| {{text anchor|CHILD}}| Caste| 
*integer | Age at which creature is considered an adult - one can think of this as the duration of the [[children|child]] stage. Allows the creature's offspring to be rendered fully tame if [[animal trainer|trained]] during their childhood. 
|-| {{text anchor|CHILDNAME}}| Caste| 
*singular
*plural | Defines a new name for a creature in the child state at the caste level. For non-caste-specific child names, see {{token|GENERAL_CHILD_NAME|c}}.

Vermin fish with this token in combination with temperate ocean and river biome tokens [http://www.bay12forums.com/smf/index.php?topic=51864.msg1122319#msg1122319 will perform seasonal migrations]. Defaults to 1:1 if not specified.

|-| {{text anchor|COLONY_EXTERNAL}}| Caste|| Caste hovers around colony.
|-| {{text anchor|COLOR}}| Creature| 
*foreground
*background
*brightness | Color of the creature's tile. (See [[Color]] for usage.)
|-| {{text anchor|COMMON_DOMESTIC}}| Caste|  | When combined with any of {{token|PET|c}}, {{token|PACK_ANIMAL|c}}, {{token|WAGON_PULLER|c}} and/or {{token|MOUNT|c}}, the creature is guaranteed to be domesticated by any [[civilization]] with {{token|COMMON_DOMESTIC_PET|e}}, {{token|COMMON_DOMESTIC_PACK|e}},  {{token|COMMON_DOMESTIC_PULL|e}} and/or {{token|COMMON_DOMESTIC_MOUNT|e}} respectively. Such civilizations will always have access to the creature, even in the absence of wild populations. This token is invalid on {{token|FANCIFUL|c}} creatures.
|-| {{text anchor|CONVERTED_SPOUSE}}| Caste|| Creatures of this caste's species with the {{token|SPOUSE_CONVERTER|c}} and {{token|NIGHT_CREATURE_HUNTER|c}} tokens will kidnap {{token|SPOUSE_CONVERSION_TARGET|c}}s of an appropriate sex and convert them into castes with CONVERTED_SPOUSE.
|-| {{text anchor|COOKABLE_LIVE}}| Caste|  | Set this to allow the creature to be cooked in meals while it is still alive, as well as when it's dead but not yet [[fishery|cleaned]]. Used by some water-dwelling vermin such as [[mussel]]s, [[nautilus]]es and [[oyster]]s. Currently does not work correctly when applied to non-{{token|FISHITEM|c}} vermin.{{bug|13200}}
|-| {{text anchor|CRAZED}}| Caste| | Creature is '[[insanity|berserk]]' and will attack all other creatures, except members of its own species that '''also''' have the CRAZED tag. It will show {{DFtext|Berserk|4:1}} in the [[unit list]]. Berserk creatures go on rampages during [[world generation|worldgen]] much more frequently than non-berserk ones.
|-| {{text anchor|COPY_TAGS_FROM}}| Special| 
*creature ID| Copies another specified creature. This will override any definitions made before it; essentially, it makes this creature identical to the other one, which can then be modified. Often used in combination with {{token|APPLY_CREATURE_VARIATION|c}} to import standard variations from a file. The vanilla [[giant animal]]s and [[animal person|animal people]]s are examples of this token combination.
|-| {{text anchor|CREATURE}}| Creature|
*creature ID| A unique, arbitrary identifier that begins the definition of each new creature, and is used to reference the creature in other tokens and raws.
|-| {{text anchor|CREATURE_CLASS}}| Caste|
*classname| An arbitrary creature classification. Can be set to anything, but the only vanilla uses are GENERAL_POISON (used in syndromes), EDIBLE_GROUND_BUG (used as targets for {{token|GOBBLE_VERMIN_CLASS|c}}), MAMMAL, and POISONOUS (both used for kobold pet eligibility). A single creature can have multiple classes.

The full list of tokens that use creature classes is: 

* Creature tokens: {{token|GOBBLE_VERMIN_CLASS|c}}, {{token|GOBBLE_VERMIN_CLASS|c}}
* Interaction tokens: {{token|IT_AFFECTED_CLASS|in}}, {{token|IT_IMMUNE_CLASS|in}}
* Animal definition (Entity) tokens: {{token|ANIMAL_CLASS|e}}, {{token|ANIMAL_FORBIDDEN_CLASS|e}}
* Position (Entity) token: {{token|ALLOWED_CLASS|po}}
* Syndrome tokens: {{token|SYN_AFFECTED_CLASS|sy}}, {{token|SYN_IMMUNE_CLASS|sy}}, {{token|CE_SENSE_CREATURE_CLASS|sy}}|-| {{text anchor|CREATURE_SOLDIER_TILE}}| Creature| 
*'character' or tile number| Creatures active in their civilization's [[military]] will use this tile instead.
|-| {{text anchor|CREATURE_TILE}}| Creature| 
*'character' or tile number | The symbol of the creature in ASCII mode.
|-| {{text anchor|CREPUSCULAR}}| Caste|  | When set, the creature will appear at dawn (between 4:30 AM and 6:00 AM) and in the evening (between 8:00 PM and 10:05 PM) in [[Adventurer mode]].
|-| {{text anchor|CURIOUSBEAST_EATER}}| Caste|  | Allows a creature to [[Steals food|steal and eat edible items]] from a site. It will attempt to grab a food item and immediately make its way to the map's edge, where it will disappear with it. If the creature goes on rampages during worldgen, it will often steal food instead of attacking. Trained and tame instances of the creature will no longer display this behavior.
|-| {{text anchor|CURIOUSBEAST_GUZZLER}}| Caste|  | Allows a creature to (very quickly) [[Steals drink|drink your alcohol]]. Or spill the barrel to the ground. Also affects undead versions of the creature. Unlike food or item thieves, drink thieves will consume your alcohol on the spot rather than run away with one piece of it. Trained and tame instances of the creature will no longer display this behavior.
|-| {{text anchor|CURIOUSBEAST_ITEM}}| Caste|  | Allows a creature to [[Steals items|steal things]] (apparently, of the highest value it can find). It will attempt to grab an item of value and immediately make its way to the map's edge, where it will disappear with it. If a creature with any of the CURIOUSBEAST tokens carries anything off the map, even if it is a caravan's pack animal, it will be reported as stealing everything it carries. If the creature goes on rampages in worldgen, it will often steal items instead of attacking - [[kea]] birds are infamous for this. Trained and tame instances of the creature will no longer display this behavior. Also, makes the creature unable to drop hauled items until it enters combat.
|-| {{text anchor|CV_ADD_TAG}}| Special| 
*TAG NAME | Adds a tag. Used in conjunction with creature variation templates.
|-| {{text anchor|CV_REMOVE_TAG}}| Special| 
*TAG NAME | Removes a tag. Used in conjunction with creature variation templates. |}

|-| {{text anchor|DOES_NOT_EXIST}}| Creature|  | Adding this token to a creature prevents it from appearing in generated worlds (unless it's marked as [[Entity_token#ANIMAL_ALWAYS_PRESENT|always present]] for a particular civilisation). For example, adding it to [[dog]]s will lead to worlds being generated without dogs in them. Also removes the creature from the [[object testing arena]]'s spawn list. If combined with {{token|FANCIFUL|c}}, artistic depictions of the creature will occur regardless. Used by [[centaur]]s, [[chimera]]s and [[griffon]]s in the vanilla game. 

Note: a creature tagged as DOES_NOT_EXIST can still be [[Interaction_token#I_EFFECT|summoned]] successfully, as long as it has a body defined in its raws [http://www.bay12forums.com/smf/index.php?topic=165213.msg8086938#msg8086938], or, another creature can [[Syndrome#CE_BODY_TRANSFORMATION|transform]] into it.|}

Eggs will be made out of eggshell. Edibility is determined by tags on whites or yolk, but they otherwise do not exist.
|-| {{text anchor|EGG_SIZE}}| Caste|
*size| Determines the size of laid [[egg]]s. Doesn't affect hatching or cooking, but bigger eggs will be heavier, and may take longer to be hauled depending on the hauler's strength.

|-| {{text anchor|EVIL}}| Creature|  | The creature is considered evil and will only show up in evil biomes. Civilizations with {{token|USE_EVIL_ANIMALS|e}} can domesticate them regardless of exotic status. Has no effect on cavern creatures except to restrict taming. A civilization with evil creatures can colonize evil areas. 

Civilizations which list evil creatures as one of their main population options will potentially emerge following an underworld mining disaster, with the added caveat that a demon will be in charge of the civ. The rules which govern which noble position the demon in charge adopts however, are unclear. It either picks one of the predefined positions, or simply makes its own.

* [[Body token#CATEGORY|BY_CATEGORY]] or [[Body token#CONTYPE|BY_TYPE]] or [[Body token#BP|BY_TOKEN]]
* TYPE, CATEGORY, or TOKEN| The creature drops an additional object when [[butcher|butchered]], as defined by {{token|EBO_ITEM|c}} and {{token|EBO_SHAPE|c}}. Used for [[gizzard stone]]s in default creatures. For some materials, needs to be defined after caste definitions with SELECT_CASTE:ALL{{Bug|6355}}
|-| {{text anchor|EXTRACT}}| Caste|
* [[material token]]| Defines a creature extract which can be obtained via [[small animal dissection]].
|-| {{text anchor|EXTRAVISION}}| Caste|  | The creature can see regardless of whether it has working eyes and has full 360 degree vision, making it impossible to strike the creature from a blind spot in combat. Invisible creatures will also be seen, namely [[intelligent undead]] using a "vanish" power.|}

! width="20%" | Arguments
! width="50%" | Description
|-| {{text anchor|FANCIFUL}}| Creature|  | The creature is a thing of legend and known to all civilizations. Its materials cannot be requested or preferred. The tag also adds some art value modifiers. Used by a [[Fanciful|number of creatures]]. Conflicts with {{token|COMMON_DOMESTIC|c}}.
|-| {{text anchor|FEATURE_ATTACK_GROUP}}| Caste|| Found on [[Animal people#Subterranean animal people|subterranean animal-man]] tribals. Currently defunct. In previous versions{{verify}}, it caused these creatures to crawl out of chasms and underground rivers.
|-| {{text anchor|FEATURE_BEAST}}| Caste|| Found on [[forgotten beast]]s. Presumably makes it act as such, initiating underground attacks on fortresses, or leads to the pop-up message upon encountering one{{verify}}. Displays the creature's {{token|DESCRIPTION|c}} in its [[legends mode]] entry and hides the creature from displaying in a world_sites_and_pops file. Does not create historical figures like generated forgotten beasts do.

Requires specifying a {{token|BIOME|c}} in which the creature will live, and both surface and subterranean biomes are allowed. Does not stack with {{token|LARGE_ROAMING|c}} and if both are used the creature will not spawn. Appears to be incompatible with {{token|DEMON|c}} even if used in separate castes.
|-| {{text anchor|FEMALE}}| Caste|  | Makes the creature biologically female, enabling her to [[Breeding|bear young]]. Usually specified inside a caste.
|-| {{text anchor|FIREIMMUNE}}| Caste|  | Makes the creature immune to [[Interaction_token#FIREBALL|FIREBALL]] and [[Interaction_token#FIREJET|FIREJET]] attacks, and allows it to path through high temperature zones, like lava or fires. Does not, by itself, make the creature immune to the damaging effects of burning in [[fire]], and does not prevent general heat damage or melting on its own (this would require adjustments to be made to the creature's body [[Material_definition_token|materials]] - see the [[Dragon/raw|dragon raws]] for an example).
|-| {{text anchor|FIREIMMUNE_SUPER}}| Caste|  | Like {{token|FIREIMMUNE|c}}, but also renders the creature immune to [[Interaction_token#DRAGONFIRE|DRAGONFIRE]] attacks. 
|-| {{text anchor|FISHITEM}}| Caste|  | The creature's corpse is a single [[Item_token#FISH_RAW|FISH_RAW]] food item that needs to be cleaned (into a [[Item_token#FISH|FISH]] item) at a [[fishery]] to become edible. Before being cleaned the item is referred to as "raw". The food item is categorized under "fish" on the food and stocks screens, and when uncleaned it is sorted under "raw fish" in the stocks (but does not show up on the food screen). 
Without this or {{token|COOKABLE_LIVE|c}}, [[fishing|fished]] vermin will turn into food the same way as non-vermin creatures, resulting in multiple units of food (meat, brain, lungs, eyes, spleen etc.) from a single fished vermin. These units of food are categorized as meat by the game.
|-| {{text anchor|FIXED_TEMP}}| Caste| 
*temperature | The creature's body is constantly at this temperature, heating up or cooling the surrounding area. Alters the temperature of the creature's inventory and all adjacent tiles, [[Temperature|with all the effects that this implies]] - may trigger wildfires at high enough values. Also makes the creature immune to extreme heat or cold, as long as the temperature set is not harmful to the materials that the creature is made from. Corpses and body parts of creatures with a fixed temperature maintain their temperature even after death.

Note that temperatures of 12000 and higher may cause [[path|pathfinding]] issues in fortress mode.
|-| {{text anchor|FLEEQUICK}}| Caste|  | If engaged in combat, the creature will flee at the first sign of resistance. Used by [[kobold]]s in the vanilla game.
|-| {{text anchor|FLIER}}| Caste|  | Allows a creature to fly, independent of it having wings or not. Fortress Mode pathfinding only partially incorporates flying - flying creatures need a land path to exist between them and an area in order to access it, but as long as one such path exists, they do not need to use it, instead being able to fly over intervening obstacles. Winged creatures with this token can lose their ability to fly if their wings are crippled or severed. Winged creatures without this token will be unable to fly. (A 'wing' in this context refers to any body part with its own [[Body_token#FLIER|FLIER]] token).

At least 1 [[Demon]] must have the flier token in order for the [[Underworld|horrifying screams]] event to trigger.
|-| {{text anchor|FREQUENCY}}| Creature|
*number, max 100| The {{token|FREQUENCY|c}} value plays two separate roles. The first is in determining the initial distribution of creatures across the world map. Each creature is randomly assigned a single x, y co-ordinate on the world map, which act as the epicenter for that creature's distribution. A square is drawn around that x, y co-ordinate with a Manhattan radius equal to the {{token|FREQUENCY|c}} value divided by 100 times the world map size. For example, in a 256 by 256 size world map, the [[lion]] might be assigned 14, 112. The [[lion]] has {{token|FREQUENCY:5|c}}, and so a square is drawn by moving 13 tiles in each direction from the [[lion]]'s x, y co-ordinate. This is the [[lion]]'s "territory".

Each sub-region in the world will attempt to fill lists of wildlife. There are five lists - {{token|VERMIN_GROUNDER|c}}, {{token|VERMIN_SOIL|c}}, {{token|VERMIN_SOIL_COLONY|c}}, {{token|LARGE_ROAMING|c}}, and {{token|LARGE_PREDATOR|c}}, corresponding with the relevant tokens. The game will attempt to place seven creatures in each list for each sub-region. The game will select the seven nearest valid creatures. Creatures are valid for sub-region's list if they have the requisite token for that list, if they have the valid token for that sub-region's biome (for example, the [lion] can only be selected for {{token|BIOME:SAVANNA_TROPICAL|c}}, {{token|BIOME:GRASSLAND_TROPICAL|c}}, and {{token|BIOME:SHRUBLAND_TROPICAL|c}}, and if their "territory" as defined by their random epicenter and {{token|FREQUENCY|c}} radius overlaps with that sub-region. These lists then determine the creatures that can actually appear within that sub-region during gameplay.

There are some exceptions to the above. If the game was not capable of filling all seven entries in a list, it will drop the overlapping territory requirement, and simply pull the nearest creature which has the correct token and biome availability. Conversely, if a creature has an epicenter but has not appeared on any of the list for any of the world map's sub-regions, the creature will be assigned to the relevant list for the nearest appropriate sub-region - meaning it is occasionally possible to have lists of eight creatures or more. This is more common in smaller worlds where there are less possible sub-regions to be assigned towards. Creatures with the {{token|GOOD|c}} and {{token|EVIL|c}} tokens ignore the epicenter distribution system altogether. They are always capable of appearing in appropriate biomes which are {{token|GOOD|b}} or {{token|EVIL|b}} respectively. This is not true for {{token|SAVAGE|c}}, which acts more like the biome tokens. Creatures with {{token|UBIQUITOUS|c}} have a "territory" which covers the entire map, regardless of their epicenter (although they can still fail to be chosen if there are 7 creatures which are eligible and have nearer epicenters to the sub-region in question).

The second use for {{token|FREQUENCY|c}} is to determine how often a creature actually appears on map. In Fortress Mode, the game will try and spawn large wildlife (creatures with {{token|LARGE_ROAMING|c}} or {{token|LARGE_PREDATOR|c}} in fairly regular waves. These waves include {{token|LARGE_ROAMING|c}}, {{token|LARGE_ROAMING|c}} combined with {{token|FLIER|c}}, {{token|LARGE_PREDATOR|c}}, and {{token|CURIOUS_BEAST|c}} - so a [[lion]] does not compete for selection with a [[gazelle]]. When the game decides it needs to spawn in a fresh wave of e.g. {{token|LARGE_ROAMING|c}} creatures, it will select one of the creatures available to it from the lists for that sub-region at random, with all creatures weighted equally. Once it has selected a creature, it then effectively rolls a d100 against the relevant creature's {{token|FREQUENCY|c}}. If the d100 is equal to the creature's {{token|FREQUENCY|c}} or less, that creature is then spawned in. If the d100 is above the creature's {{token|FREQUENCY|c}}, the game returns to the relevant list and selects again. {{token|UBIQUITOUS|c}} acts as {{token|FREQUENCY:100|c}} for these purposes - in other words, the creature cannot fail the d100 check and will always be spawned in if it is selected from the list.

* <gait name>
* <max [[Gait#Speed|speed]]>
* <build up time>
* <max turning [[Gait#Speed|speed]]>
* <start [[Gait#Speed|speed]]>
* <energy expenditure>
* <gait flag(s)>| Defines a gait by which the creature can move. See [[Gait]] for more information. Specifically, you likely want to use one of the existing STANDARD_X_GAITS creature variations, as described in [[Gait#Gaits_and_Modding|this subsection]].

* <max speed> indicates the maximum [[Gait#Speed|speed]] achievable by a creature using this gait
* <start speed> indicates the creature's speed when it starts moving using this gait
* <build up time> indicates how long it will take for a creature using this gait to go from <start speed> to <max speed>. For example, a value of 10 means that it should be able to reach the maximum speed by moving 10 [[tile]]s in a straight line over even terrain.
* <max turning speed> indicates the maximum speed permissible when the creature suddenly changes its direction of motion. The creature's speed will be reduced to <max turning speed> if travelling at a higher speed than this before turning.
* <energy expenditure> indicates how energy-consuming the gait is. Higher values cause the creature to tire out faster. Persistent usage of a high-intensity gait will eventually lead to exhaustion and [[Status_icon#Non-flashing|collapse]].

'''NO_BUILD_UP''' can be specified instead of a <start speed> value to make the <max speed> instantly achievable upon initiating movement (this is equivalent to a <build up time> of 0). Note that <build up time> and <max turning speed> are both ignored if specified alongside this (as NO_BUILD_UP trumps <build up time> and preserves <max speed> whilst turning, and <max turning speed> cannot exceed <max speed>) so it is permissible to omit them so long as they are '''both''' omitted together.

It's possible to specify a <start speed> greater than the <max speed>; the moving creature will decelerate towards its <max speed> in this case.


'''valid gait types:'''
*'''WALK'''<br>
Used for moving normally over ground tiles.

*'''CRAWL'''<br>
Used for moving over ground tiles whilst [[Status_icon#Non-flashing|prone]].

*'''SWIM'''<br>
Used for moving through tiles containing [[water]] or [[magma]] at a [[Water#Depth|depth]] of at least 4/7. 

*'''FLY'''<br>
Used for moving through [[open space]].

*'''CLIMB'''<br>
Used for moving whilst [[Climber|climbing]].


'''valid gait flags:'''
* '''AGILITY'''<br>
Speeds/slows movement depending on the creature's [[Attribute#Agility|Agility]] stat.

* '''STRENGTH'''<br>
Speeds/slows movement depending on the creature's [[Attribute#Strength|Strength]] stat.

* '''LAYERS_SLOW'''<br>
Makes [[Tissue_definition_token#THICKENS_ON_ENERGY_STORAGE|THICKENS_ON_ENERGY_STORAGE]] and [[Tissue_definition_token#THICKENS_ON_STRENGTH|THICKENS_ON_STRENGTH]] tissue layers slow movement depending on how thick they are. Adding the STRENGTH gait flag counteracts the impact of the latter layer.

* '''STEALTH_SLOWS:'''<percentage><br>
Slows movement by the specified percentage when the creature is [[Ambusher|sneaking]].

*value A
*value B| Has the same function as {{token|MATERIAL_FORCE_MULTIPLIER|c}}, but applies to all attacks instead of just those involving a specific material. Appears to be overridden by MATERIAL_FORCE_MULTIPLIER ([[werebeast]]s, for example, use both tokens to provide resistance to all materials, with one exception to which they are especially vulnerable).
|-| {{text anchor|GENERATED}}| Creature|  | Found on procedurally generated creatures like [[forgotten beast]]s, [[titan]]s, [[demon]]s, [[angel]]s, and [[night creature]]s. Cannot be specified in user-defined raws.
|-| {{text anchor|GETS_INFECTIONS_FROM_ROT}}| Caste|  | Makes the creature get [[Health_care#Infection|infections]] from necrotic tissue.
|-| {{text anchor|GETS_WOUND_INFECTIONS}}| Caste|  | Makes the creature's wounds become [[Health_care#Infection|infected]] if left untreated for too long.
|-| {{text anchor|GLOWCOLOR}}| Creature| 
*foreground
*background
*brightness | The colour of the creature's {{token|GLOWTILE|c}}.
|-| {{text anchor|GLOWTILE}}| Creature| 
*ascii character | If present, the being glows in the dark (generally used for Adventurer Mode). The tile is what replaces the being's current tile when it is obscured from your sight by darkness. The default setting for kobolds (a yellow quotation mark) provides a nice "glowing eyes" effect. The game is also hardcoded to automatically convert quotation mark GLOWTILES into apostrophes if the creature has lost one eye. This works at the generic creature level - for caste-specific glow tiles, use {{token|CASTE_GLOWTILE|c}} instead.
|-| {{text anchor|GNAWER}}| Caste| 
*verb| The creature can and will gnaw its way out of [[animal trap]]s and [[cage]]s using the specified verb, depending on the material from which it is made (normally wood).
|-| {{text anchor|GOBBLE_VERMIN_CLASS}}| Caste| 
*class| The creature eats vermin of the specified class.
|-| {{text anchor|GOBBLE_VERMIN_CREATURE}}| Caste|

|-| {{text anchor|GO_TO_TAG}}| Special|  | When using tags from an existing creature, inserts new tags ''before'' the specified tag.
|-| {{text anchor|GOOD}}| Creature|  | Creature is considered good and will only show up in good biomes - [[unicorn]]s, for example. Civilizations with {{token|USE_GOOD_ANIMALS|e}} can domesticate them regardless of exotic status. Has no effect on cavern creatures except to restrict taming. A civilization that has good creatures can colonise good areas in world-gen.
|-| {{text anchor|GRASSTRAMPLE}}| Caste| 
*value | The value determines how rapidly [[grass]] is trampled when a creature steps on it - a value of 0 causes the creature to never damage grass, while a value of 100 causes grass to be trampled as rapidly as possible. Defaults to 5.
|-| {{text anchor|GRAVITATE_BODY_SIZE}}| Caste| 
*target value| Used in Creature Variants. This token changes the adult body size to the average of the old adult body size and the target value and scales all intermediate growth stages by the same factor.
|-| {{text anchor|GRAZER}}| Caste|
*number| The creature is a grazer - if tamed in fortress mode, it needs a pasture to survive. The higher the number, the less frequently it needs to eat in order to live. Not used since 0.40.12, replaced by {{token|STANDARD_GRAZER|c}} to fix {{bugl|4113}}.|}

*speech file| What this creature says while hunting adventurers in its lair.
|-| {{text anchor|LARGE_PREDATOR}}| Caste|  | Will attack other creatures that are smaller than it. Tamed large predators will still attack wildlife. In [[fortress mode]], only one group of "large predators" (possibly two groups on "savage" maps) will appear on any given map. In [[adventurer mode]], large predators will try to ambush and attack you (and your party will attack them back). When tamed, large predators tend to be much more aggressive to enemies than non-large predators, making them a good choice for an animal army. They may go on rampages in worldgen, and adventurers may receive quests to kill them. Also, they can be mentioned in the intro paragraph when starting a fortress e.g. "ere the wolves get hungry."
A single biome supports 7 large predator species, picking randomly and rolling a d100 under its {{token|FREQUENCY|c}} to add it until all 7 slots are filled.

Incompatible with {{token|PACK_ANIMAL|c}} on a technicality, if included: hauled items are likely to be dropped upon entering the map (even if {{token|TRADE_CAPACITY|c}} is present) in contrast to when the merchants depart.
|-| {{text anchor|LARGE_ROAMING}}| Creature|  | This is the core requisite tag allowing the creature to spawn as a wild animal in the appropriate biomes. Requires specifying a {{token|BIOME|c}} in which the creature will spawn. Does not require specifying a frequency, population number, or cluster number.

This tag stacks with {{token|MEGABEAST|c}}, {{token|SEMIMEGABEAST|c}}, or {{token|NIGHT_CREATURE_HUNTER|c}}; if used with one of these tags, the creature will spawn as both a boss and as a wild animal. This tag does not stack with {{token|FEATURE_BEAST|c}} and if both are used the creature will not spawn. This tag is unaffected by {{token|DEMON|c}}.
Large roamers are not able to spawn in Pool biomes as they do not connect to the edge of the map and are too small, Lake biomes are a suitable alternative.

|-| {{text anchor|LIGHT_GEN}}| Caste|  | A vermin featuring this tag will remain visible to an adventurer even at night. 

Subterranean vermin which feature this token will flicker in unexposed and unrevealed cavern layers while playing in Fortress Mode.
|-| {{text anchor|LIKES_FIGHTING}}| Caste|  | The creature will attack enemies rather than flee from them. This tag has the same effect on player-controlled creatures - including modded dwarves. Retired as of v0.40.14 in favor of {{token|LARGE_PREDATOR|c}}.
|-| {{text anchor|LISP}}| Caste| | Creature uses "sssssnake talk" (multiplies 'S' when talking - "My name isss Recisssiz.").

*[[Material token]]
*value A
*value B| When struck with a weapon made of the specified material, the force exerted will be multiplied by A/B, thus making the creature more or less susceptible to this material. For example, if A is 2 and B is 1, the force exerted by the defined material will be doubled. If A is 1 and B is 2, it will be halved instead. See also  {{token|GENERAL_MATERIAL_FORCE_MULTIPLIER|c}}, which can be used to make this sort of effect applicable to all materials.
|-| {{text anchor|MATUTINAL}}| Caste| | When set, the creature will only appear at dawn (between 4:30 AM and 6:00 AM) in [[Adventurer mode]].
|-| {{text anchor|MAXAGE}}| Caste| 
*min
*max | Determines the creature's natural lifespan, using the specified minimum and maximum age values (in years). Each individual creature with this token is generated with a predetermined date (calculated down to the exact [[time|tick]]!) between these values, at which it is destined to die of old age, should it live long enough. Note that the probability of death at any given age does not increase as the creature gets older [http://i.imgur.com/A1A4aA9.png]. 
Creatures which lack this token are naturally immortal. The [[Syndrome#CE_ADD_TAG|NO_AGING]] syndrome tag will prevent death by old age from occurring. Also note that, among civilized creatures, castes which lack this token will refuse to marry others with it, and vice versa.
|-| {{text anchor|MEANDERER}}| Caste|  | Makes the creature slowly stroll around, unless it's in combat or performing a job. If combined with {{token|CAN_LEARN|c}}, will severely impact their [[pathfinding]] and lead the creature to move extremely slowly when not performing any task. Problematically applies to animal people based on the animal, and war trained animals{{bug|9588}}.
|-| {{text anchor|MEGABEAST}}| Caste|  | A 'boss' creature; a small number of those are created during worldgen, their histories and descendants (if any) will be tracked in worldgen (as opposed to simply 'spawning'), and they will occasionally go on rampages, potentially leading to worship if they attack the same place multiple times. Their presence and number will also influence age names. When appearing in fortress mode, they will have a pop-up message announcing their arrival. They will remain hostile to the fortress military even after being tamed.{{bug|10731}} See [[megabeast]] page for more details. 

Requires specifying a {{token|BIOME|c}} in which the creature will live. Subterranean biomes appear to not be allowed. Does stack with {{token|LARGE_ROAMING|c}} and if both are used the creature will spawn as both historical bosses and as wild animals.
|-| {{text anchor|MENT_ATT_CAP_PERC}}| Caste|
*[[Attribute|ATTRIBUTE]] Token
*Cap %|Default is 200.  This means you can increase your attribute to 200% of its starting value (or the average value + your starting value if that is higher).
|-| {{text anchor|MENT_ATT_RANGE}}| Caste|
*[[Attribute|ATTRIBUTE]]
*lowest

*[[Attribute|ATTRIBUTE]] Token
*cost to improve
*unused counter rate
*rust counter rate
*demotion counter rate| [[Attribute#Soul_attributes|Mental attribute]] gain/decay rates. Lower numbers in the last three slots make decay occur faster. Defaults are 500:4:5:4.
|-| {{text anchor|MILKABLE}}| Caste| 
* [[material token]]
* frequency| Allows the creature to be [[milk]]ed in the [[farmer's workshop]]. The frequency is the amount of [[time|ticks]] the creature needs to "recharge" (i.e. how much time needs to pass before it can be milked again). Does not work on [[#CAN_LEARN|sentient]] creatures, regardless of [[ethics]].
|-| {{text anchor|MISCHIEVIOUS}}| Caste|| Alias for {{token|MISCHIEVOUS|c}}.
|-| {{text anchor|MISCHIEVOUS}}| Caste|  | The creature spawns [[stealth]]ed and will attempt to path into the fortress, pulling any [[lever]]s it comes across. It will be invisible on the map and [[unit list]] until spotted by a citizen, at which point the game will pause and recenter on the creature. Used by [[gremlin]]s in the vanilla game. "They go on little missions to mess with various fortress buildings, not just levers." 
|-| {{text anchor|MODVALUE}}| Caste|  | Seemingly no longer used.
|-| {{text anchor|MOUNT}}| Caste|  | Creature may be used as a [[mount]]. No use for the player in fortress mode, but enemy sieging forces may arrive with cavalry. Mounts are usable in adventure mode.
|-| {{text anchor|MOUNT_EXOTIC}}| Caste|  | Creature may be used as a [[mount]], but civilizations cannot domesticate it in worldgen without certain exceptions.
|-| {{text anchor|MULTIPART_FULL_VISION}}| Caste|  | Allows the creature to have all-around vision, as long as it has multiple heads that can see.
|-| {{text anchor|MULTIPLE_LITTER_RARE}}| Caste|  | Makes the species usually produce a single offspring per birth, with a 1/500 chance of using the {{token|LITTERSIZE|c}} as usual.  Requires {{token|FEMALE|c}}.

|-| {{text anchor|NAME}}| Creature| 
*singular
*plural
*adjective | The generic name for any creature of this type - will be used for referring to the species in the abstract, such as the default material prefix. For labeling individual creatures, {{token|CASTE_NAME|c}} is necessary. If left undefined, the creature will be labeled as "nothing" by the game.

Some examples of adjective use:
* "super''dwarven'' strength"
* "the ''dwarven'' hillocks of X"
* Deity species as in "''feline'' deity"
* Megabeast attacks in worldgen. One with multiple dragons being a "''draconic'' rampage"
|-| {{text anchor|NATURAL}}| Caste|  | Animal is considered to be natural. NATURAL animals will not engage creatures tagged with {{token|AT_PEACE_WITH_WILDLIFE|c}} in combat unless they are members of a hostile entity and vice-versa.
|-| {{text anchor|NATURAL_ANIMAL}}| Caste| | Alias of {{token|NATURAL|c}}.
|-| {{text anchor|NATURAL_SKILL}}| Caste| 
*[[Skill_token|Skill token]]
*value| The creature possesses the specified [[skill]] at this level inherently - that is, it begins with the skill at this level, and the skill may never rust below that. A value of 15 is legendary.
|-| {{text anchor|NIGHT_CREATURE}}| Caste|| Creatures with this token can appear as [[experiment|experiments]]. Causes the creature to count as {{token|NOT_LIVING|c}}. 

Killing a creature featuring this token provides one point of "hero" reputation. Adds the creature's description as part of the initial summary of their historical figure in legends mode. People will react to creatures with this token as a night creature (natch). In adventure mode, ambushes involving these units will say "Night creature!" instead of "Ambush!" 

Prevents creature behavior enabled by {{token|LARGE_PREDATOR|c}}.

Removes the high nature value check imposed by {{token|LOCAL_POPS_PRODUCE_HEROES|c}}.

Prevents the AI from using ANIMATE interactions, unless the newly-animated{{token|OPPOSED_TO_LIFE|c}}undead will not attack them. The check for this is specifically whether the unit is: 
*a ghost
*an animated unit 
*a unit with the {{token|NO_AGING|c}} token added via {{token|CE_ADD_TAG|c}}. (This allows for the default exclusion of elves and goblins, unless raised as intelligent undead.)
|-| {{text anchor|NIGHT_CREATURE_BOGEYMAN}}| Caste|| Creatures with this token can appear in [[bogeyman|bogeyman ambushes]] in [[adventure mode]], where they adopt classical bogeyman traits such as stalking the adventurer and vaporising when dawn breaks. Such traits do not manifest if the creature is encountered outside of a bogeyman ambush (for instance, as a megabeast or a civilised being). In addition, their corpses and severed body parts turn into [[smoke]] after a short while. Note that setting the "Number of Bogeyman Types" in [[advanced world generation]] to 0 will only remove randomly-generated bogeymen.
|-| {{text anchor|NIGHT_CREATURE_EXPERIMENTER}}| Caste|| Found on some [[necromancer]]s. Creatures with this tag may periodically "perform horrible experiments" offscreen, during which they can use creature-targeting interactions with an <code>[[Interaction_token#I_SOURCE|[I_SOURCE:EXPERIMENT]]]</code> tag on living creatures in their area. Worlds are generated with a list of procedurally-generated experiments, allowing necromancers to turn living people and animals into [[Infected_ghoul|ghouls]] and [[Experiment|other experimental creatures]], and these will automatically be available to all experimenters; it does not appear possible to prevent this. You can mod in your own custom experiment interactions, but these are used very infrequently due to the large number of generated experiments.
|-| {{text anchor|NIGHT_CREATURE_HUNTER}}| Caste|| Found on [[night troll]]s and [[werebeast]]s. Implies that the creature is a [[night creature]], and shows its description in [[legends mode]] entry. The creature is always hostile and will start [[no quarter]] combat with any nearby creatures, except for members of its own race. Note that this tag does not override the creature's normal behavior in [[fortress mode]] except for the aforementioned aggression, and doesn't prevent the creature from fleeing the battles it started. It also removes the creature's materials from stockpile settings list, making them be stored there regardless of settings.

Does stack with {{token|LARGE_ROAMING|c}} and if both are used the creature will spawn as both historical hunters and as wild animals; this requires specifying a {{token|BIOME|c}} in which the creature will live, and subterranean biomes are allowed.

This tag causes the usual behaviour of werebeasts in worldgen, that is, fleeing towns upon being cursed and conducting raids from a lair. If this tag is absent from a deity curse, the accursed will simply be driven out of towns in a similar manner to [[vampire]]s. When paired with SPOUSE_CONVERTER, a very small population of the creature will be created during worldgen (sometimes only a single individual will be created), and their histories will be tracked (that is, they will not spawn spontaneously later, they must either have children or convert other creatures to increase their numbers). The creature will settle in a lair and go on rampages during worldgen. It will actively attempt to seek out potential conversion targets to abduct, convert, and have children with (if possible).
|-| {{text anchor|NIGHT_CREATURE_NIGHTMARE}}| Caste|| Found on [[nightmare]]s. Corpses and severed body parts derived from creatures with this token turn into [[smoke]] after a short while.

|-| {{text anchor|NO_EAT}}| Caste|  | Creature does not need to [[food|eat]].
|-| {{text anchor|NO_FEVERS}}| Caste|  | Creature cannot suffer [[Symptom#Fever|fevers]].
|-| {{text anchor|NO_GENDER}}| Caste|| The creature is biologically sexless, making it unable to [[breeding|breed]].
|-| {{text anchor|NO_PHYS_ATT_GAIN}}| Caste|| The creature cannot raise any [[Attribute#Body_attributes|physical attributes]].
|-| {{text anchor|NO_PHYS_ATT_RUST}}| Caste| | The creature cannot lose any [[Attribute#Body_attributes|physical attributes]].
|-| {{text anchor|NO_SLEEP}}| Caste|  | Creature does not need to sleep, but can still be rendered unconscious by other means.
|-| {{text anchor|NO_SPRING}}| Caste|  | The creature caste does not appear in [[Calendar|spring]].
|-| {{text anchor|NO_SUMMER}}| Caste|  | The creature caste does not appear in [[Calendar|summer]].
|-| {{text anchor|NO_THOUGHT_CENTER_FOR_MOVEMENT}}| Caste|  | The bodyparts of this creature don't need to be connected to an organ with the {{token|THOUGHT|body}} tag in order to have motor function. Generally used on creatures that don't have brains. If a creature doesn't have a thought part and doesn't have this token, it will be unable to grasp or stand. Nautilus men experience this issue in vanilla.
|-| {{text anchor|NO_UNIT_TYPE_COLOR}}| Caste|  | Prevents creature from selecting its color based on its profession (e.g. Miner, Hunter, Wrestler).
|-| {{text anchor|NO_VEGETATION_PERTURB}}| Caste{{Verify}}|  | Likely prevents the creature from leaving broken vegetation tracks.{{Verify}}
|-| {{text anchor|NO_WINTER}}| Caste|  | The creature caste does not appear in [[Calendar|winter]].
|-| {{text anchor|NOBONES}}| Caste|  | Creature cannot be picked up for worldgen fell moods and cannot be made a skeleton deity.
|-| {{text anchor|NOBREATHE}}| Caste|  | Creature doesn't need to breathe or have {{token|BREATHE|body}}parts in its body, nor can it drown or be strangled. Creatures living in magma must have this tag, otherwise they will drown.
|-| {{text anchor|NOCTURNAL}}| Caste|  | When set, the creature will only appear at night (after 10:05 PM and before 4:30 AM) in [[Adventurer mode]].
|-| {{text anchor|NOEMOTION}}| Caste|  | Creature has no emotions, thus; it is immune to the effects of [[stress]] and unable to rage, and its [[need]]s cannot be fulfilled in any way. Used on [[undead]] in the vanilla game.
|-| {{text anchor|NOEXERT}}| Caste|  | Creature can't become tired or over-exerted from taking too many combat actions, or moving at full speed for extended periods of time. 
|-| {{text anchor|NOFEAR}}| Caste|  | Creature doesn't feel fear and will never flee from battle, and will be immune to [[ghost]]s' attempts to 'scare it to death'. Additionally, it causes [[bogeyman|bogeymen]] and [[nightmare]]s to become friendly towards the creature.
|-| {{text anchor|NOMEAT}}| Caste|  | Creature will not be hunted or fed to wild beasts.
|-| {{text anchor|NONAUSEA}}| Caste|  | Creature isn't nauseated by gut hits and cannot vomit.
|-| {{text anchor|NOPAIN}}| Caste|  | Creature doesn't feel pain. 
|-| {{text anchor|NOSKIN}}| Caste|  | Creature will not drop a hide when [[butcher|butchered]]. 
|-| {{text anchor|NOSKULL}}| Caste|  | Creature will not drop a skull on butchering, rot, or decay of severed head.
|-| {{text anchor|NOSMELLYROT}}| Caste|  | Does not produce [[miasma]] when rotting.
|-| {{text anchor|NOSTUCKINS}}| Caste|  | Weapons can't get stuck in the creature. 
|-| {{text anchor|NOSTUN}}| Caste|  | Creature can't be stunned and knocked unconscious by pain or head injuries. Creatures with this tag never wake up from sleep in Fortress Mode. If this creature needs to sleep while playing, it <b>will</b> die.
|-| {{text anchor|NOT_BUTCHERABLE}}| Caste|  | Corpses from this creature cannot be [[butcher|butchered]]. Does not prevent the creature from being slaughtered while alive, however.
|-| {{text anchor|NOT_LIVING}}| Caste| | Cannot be raised from the dead by necromancers or evil clouds. Implies the creature is not a normal living being. Used by [[vampire]]s, [[Mummy|mummies]] and inorganic creatures like the [[amethyst man]] and [[bronze colossus]]. Creatures who are {{token|OPPOSED_TO_LIFE|c}} (undead) will be docile towards creatures with this token.
|-| {{text anchor|NOTHOUGHT}}| Caste|  | Creature doesn't require a {{token|THOUGHT|body}} body part to survive. Has the added effect of preventing speech, though directly controlling creatures that would otherwise be capable of speaking allows them to engage in conversation.|}

Used by [[undead]] in the vanilla game. Functions without the {{token|NOT_LIVING|c}} token, and seems to imply said token as well. Undead will not be hostile to otherwise-living creatures given this token. Living creatures given this token will attack living creatures that lack it, while ignoring other living creatures that also have this token.
|-| {{text anchor|ORIENTATION}}| Caste| 
*MALE/FEMALE
*disinterested chance
*casual chance
*strong chance| Determines caste's likelihood of having sexual attraction to certain sexes. Values default to 75:20:5 for the same sex and 5:20:75 for the opposite sex. The first value indicates how likely to be entirely uninterested in the sex, the second decides if the creature will be able to become lovers with that sex, the third decides whether they will be able to marry in worldgen and post-worldgen world activities (which implies being able to become lovers). Marriage seems to be able to happen in fort mode play regardless, as long as they are lovers first.
|-| {{text anchor|OUTSIDER_CONTROLLABLE}}| Caste|| Lets you play as an [[Adventurer_mode_character_creation#Outsider|outsider]] of this species in adventure mode.

Also prevents creature from dropping hauled items on its own -- do ''not'' use for player-controllable creatures! May lead to the creature being domesticated during worldgen, even if it doesn't have {{token|COMMON_DOMESTIC|c}}.

Creatures with this tag but without {{token|BENIGN|c}}, and/or with {{token|LARGE_PREDATOR|c}} leads to hauled items being dropped.

Objects made of most materials (e.g. metal) roll a number from 0-100, and if the resulting number is greater than the penetrate power, their contents escape for the time being. Objects made of [[wood]], [[leather]], [[amber]], or [[coral]] roll 0-95, and items made of [[cloth]] roll 0-90.
|-| {{text anchor|PERSONALITY}}| Caste| 
*ATTRIBUTE

|-| {{text anchor|PET}}| Caste|  | Allows the creature to be [[Animal_trainer|tamed]] in Fortress mode. Prerequisite for all other working animal roles. Civilizations that encounter it in worldgen will tame and domesticate it for their own use. Adding this to civilization members will classify them as pets instead of citizens, with all the [[Fun|problems]] that entails. However, you can solve these problems using the popular plugin [https://dffd.bay12games.com/file.php?id=13095| Dwarf Therapist], which is completely unaffected by the tag.
|-| {{text anchor|PET_EXOTIC}}| Caste|  | Allows the creature to be [[Animal_trainer|tamed]] in Fortress mode. Prequisite for all other working animal roles.

|-| {{text anchor|POWER}}| Caste|| Allows the being to represent itself as a deity, allowing it to become the leader of a civilized group. Not used by any creatures in the vanilla game. Requires {{token|CAN_SPEAK|c}} to actually do anything more than settle at a location (e.g. write books, lead armies, profane temples). Doesn't appear to do anything for creatures that are already civilized. Once the creature ascends to a position of leadership, it will proceed to act as a standard ruler for their entity and fulfill the same functions (hold tournaments, tame creatures, etc.).
|-| {{text anchor|PREFSTRING}}| Creature|

It will be unable to move or attack, but enemies will only be able to attack the specified body part(s). When one of the specified body part is severed off, the creature automatically unretracts and cannot retract anymore. More than one body part can be selected by using BY_TYPE or BY_CATEGORY.

Second-person descriptions are used for adventurer mode natural ability. "<pro_pos>" can be used in the descriptions, being replaced with the proper pronoun (or lack thereof) in-game.

Undead curled up creatures are buggy, specifically those that retract into their upper bodies: [[echidna]]s, [[hedgehog]]s and [[pangolin]]s.{{bug|11463}}{{bug|10519}} The upper body is prevented from collapsing by a separate body part (the middle spine), which cannot be attacked when the creature is retracted.

Values from 1-3 are the respective [[cavern]] levels, 4 is the [[magma sea]] and 5 is the [[HFS]]. A single argument may be used instead of min and max. [[Demon]]s use only 5:5; user-defined creatures with both this depth and {{token|FLIER}} will take part in the initial wave from the HFS alongside generated demons, but without {{token|FLIER}} they will only spawn from the map edges.

|-| {{text anchor|USE_CASTE}}| Creature|
*new caste token
*old caste token| Defines a new caste derived directly from a previous caste. The new caste inherits all properties of the old one. The effect of this tag is automatic if one has not yet defined any castes: "Any caste-level tag that occurs before castes are explicitly declared is saved up and placed on any caste that is declared later, unless the caste is explicitly derived from another caste."
Roostre: "When DF detects duplicate tokens in the raws of the same object, a failsafe seems to kick in; it takes the bottom-most of the duplicates, and disregards the others. In the case of tokens added by a mod, it prioritizes the duplicate in the mod." This means that if a tag is defined in the base-caste and redefined in the derived caste, the derived tag overwrites the base tag.

If the injected material has an associated [[syndrome]] with the [[Syndrome#SYN_INJECTED|[SYN_INJECTED]]] token, it will be transmitted to the victim. If the attack is blunt, the injected material lacks the [[Material definition token#ENTERS_BLOOD|[ENTERS_BLOOD]]] token, the attacked bodypart has no [[Tissue_definition_token#VASCULAR|[VASCULAR]]] tissues, or the victim is bloodless, the material will splatter over the attacked body part instead.

==Tissue Layer Tokens==
Tissue layers are added to a creature's body parts by the creature tokens [[#TISSUE_LAYER|TISSUE_LAYER]], [[#TISSUE_LAYER_OVER|TISSUE_LAYER_OVER]], [[#TISSUE_LAYER_UNDER|TISSUE_LAYER_UNDER]], and the body detail plan token [[#TL_LAYERS|TL_LAYERS]].

These tissue layers are not the same thing as tissues, which are defined at creature level, but rather applications of the tissues. If the SKIN tissue of a creature is the more general and abstract notion of what skin is for that creature, then a tissue layer may be the "actual" skin on the creature's nose, head, or second toe. As most creatures have more than one body part, tissue layers are normally selected en masse.

Some tissue layer tokens are analogous to tissue definition tokens, e.g. [[#TL_CONNECTS|TL_CONNECTS]] to [[tissue_definition_token#CONNECTS|CONNECTS]].
