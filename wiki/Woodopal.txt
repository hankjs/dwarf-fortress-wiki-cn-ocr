'''Wood opals''' are moderately-valuable [[gem]]s that can be found just about anywhere.

==In real life==
Wood opals are a variety of [[petrified wood]] whose structure happened to transition into opal instead of the more usual chalcedony. The amount of actual opal on the fossil can be as little as a thin shiny coating, but the in-game versions probably represent the much more valuable and uncommon solid opal specimens.
