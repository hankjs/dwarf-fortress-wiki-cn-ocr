'''Cinnabar''' is a brilliant red [[stone]] found as veins in numerous environments. Despite its appearance in ASCII mode (showing up as {{Raw Tile|£|4:7:1}} unmined and {{Raw Tile|*|4:1}} mined), it is '''not''' a usable [[ore]].

Cinnabar is also the most [[density|dense]] non-economic stone besides [[slade]], so it's very good for [[trap|stone-fall traps]] and as [[catapult]] ammo. Hauling cinnabar is not realistic, or at least will take an eternity, without a [[wheelbarrow]]. Additionally, cinnabar [[craft]]s are so heavyweight that they can quickly fill up a caravan.
==In real life==
Cinnabar is a mineral of mercury sulfide (HgS), and has been used throughout history both for the ease in which it can be made to release its elemental mercury, and for use as a [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vermilion red pigment] in paint. In ancient Roman history, slaves or prisoners were consigned to cinnabar mines as a death sentence – unlike humans, dwarves are evidently immune to mercury poisoning.
