A '''tower''' is a structure inside human [[town]]s. They are built by rich [[historical figure]]s like town officials, [[counting house|merchants]], or those who had a windfall at gambling in the local [[tavern]]. Towers can be inherited, sold, or bought, and are an excellent place to conduct [[intrigue|schemes]], as well as hide [[artifact]]s. However, they should not be confused with [[Tower_(necromancy)|necromancer's towers]].

== World generation ==
During world generation, rich [[historical figure]]s will buy properties in towns and, if they have enough money, build a tower.  Then, over the following years, the tower can be remodelled to include some improvements, of which these currently are the following:

;Dungeons
:This is currently something that happens in legends only. The [[dungeon]]s in adventurer mode are delayed for now.
;Courtyard
:A walled courtyard with flowering plants will be added, filling out the plot.
;Feasthall
:A feasthall with tables and chairs is added.
;Fortifications
:Fortifications will be added at the top level.

== Adventurer Mode ==

You can visit towers in adventurer mode. Sometimes, their owners will be present in them.
