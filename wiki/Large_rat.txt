'''Large rats''' are [[creature]]s commonly found in the first layer of the [[caverns]], larger than a common [[rat]] but smaller than a [[giant rat]]. About the size of a [[kobold]], these creatures will [[Steals food|steal your food]] and [[Steals drink|drink your booze]] at every chance, meaning they should be kept away from your [[food]] [[stockpile]]s by all means necessary. All large rats are born with Legendary [[skill]] in [[Climber|climbing]], and their infants are called ''large rat pups''.

Large rats are benign and will flee from conflict, but [[Dwarf|dwarves]] will generally react violently to their presence, leading to them often getting beaten to a pulp by your [[peasant]]s before they have the chance to cause any trouble. These creatures can be captured with [[cage]] [[trap]]s very easily, as a food stockpile with a couple pieces of food can be used as lure. Once captured, they can be turned into fairly valuable [[pet]]s, though due to their very short lifespan (no more than 3 years), they make poor companions to dwarves and are better off being [[butcher]]ed.

Clothing made from large rat leather have names that can sound awkward due to the way the game handles sizes for different creatures.  A dwarf sized tunic is called a large rat leather tunic.  A tunic made for bigger creatures like a human would be called a large large rat leather tunic.  A tunic made for a smaller creature like a kobold would be called a small large rat leather tunic.

Some dwarves [[Preferences|like]] large rats for their ''strength''.
