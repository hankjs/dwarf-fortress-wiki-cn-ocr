'''Giant capuchins''' are [[giant animal]] versions of the common [[capuchin]] who can be found in [[savage]] [[tropical]] [[forest]]s and [[mangrove]] [[swamp]]s. These monkeys enjoy raiding your fortress for [[steals food|food]] and [[steals items|valuables]] in groups of 5-10, whilst menacing off any [[dwarves]] foolish enough to think of stopping them due to being almost four times heavier than them. Regular capuchins are annoying, but giant ones manage to be annoying ''and'' dangerous, and can ruin the game for you early in your fortress's life, before you can get all of your things underground.

Giant capuchins do have a pretty high [[pet]] value of 500, however, so if you manage to capture one, you're probably better off keeping it. Young giant capuchins require two years to grow to full size, and three years to reach adulthood, making them viable livestock for a [[meat industry]]. Like other giant animals, giant capuchins are exotic [[mount]]s.

Some dwarves [[preference|prefer]] giant capuchins for their ''intelligence'' and ''social nature''.
