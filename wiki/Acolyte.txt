'''Acolytes''' are a minor [[noble]] position used by [[elf|elven]] civilizations, appointed by the [[druid]]. Each civilization will only have one of these, and they have no assigned responsibilities. The only thing notable about them is that they rise to the position of [[druid]] in the event the current one suffers from [[war|the usual unfortunate mishaps.]]

They are assigned by druids and thus functions as their designated succesor.

While they can be encountered in [[adventurer mode]], they generally will not show up in [[fortress mode]].
