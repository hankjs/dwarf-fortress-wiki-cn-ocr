'''Octopus men''' are [[animal people]] variants of the common [[octopus]] who can be found in [[savage]] [[ocean]]s. They spawn in groups of 1-5 individuals and are generally content to keep to themselves. In terms of size, they are a little over half the weight of the average [[dwarf]].

While they can learn and are able to join [[civilization]]s, they never do so, as they are completely [[aquatic]] and cannot survive on the surface.

Some dwarves [[Preferences|like]] octopus men for their ''many arms'' and their ''intelligence''.

<!-- Reference: "Doctor Octopus", Spider-Man villain -->
'''Octopus men''' have been known to take over the bodies of Spider-men, deeming themselves to have superior intellect compared to the Spider-men.

<!-- Reference: "Octolings", enemies from "Splatoon" series of games -->
Octopus men are a surprisingly unscrupulous race; they often feud with [[Squid man|squid men]] over territory and are known to steal precious materials from them. In rare instances, squid man [[singer]]s have even been kidnapped from their undersea homes and forced to perform for octopus men. Despite this, there is evidence that octopus men and squid men were on equal terms in the distant past.

<!-- Reference: "Octodad" from titular video game series -->
Octopus men occasionally will don a [[clothing|shirt, coat, and trousers]] and [[marriage|marry]] a [[human]], usually living together in the [[town|suburbs]] with [[children]]. Despite their obvious differences, members of the civilization rarely suspect anything, with the notable exceptions of [[cook|chefs]]. Such chefs will form a [[grudge]] against the octopus man and frequently seek [[butcher|vengeance]] armed with a [[tool|meat cleaver]].

<!-- Reference: "Sekto", main antagonist of "Oddworld: Stranger's Wrath" and "oktigi" species -->
For over 14 years there have been rumors of some octopus men actually being [[Deer man|deer men]] whose bodies have been taken over by a parasitic type of octopus, dubbed "oktigi". This is just silly, and the rumors have stopped by the end of 2020.
