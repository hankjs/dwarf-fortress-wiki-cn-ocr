'''Speech files''', also known as '''text sets''', are text files that define sentences which can be spoken by people in [[adventure mode]] and phrases used to name [[books]]. Most of them are found in the <code>data/vanilla/vanilla_text/objects</code> folder, though the creature specific files can be found in <code>data/vanilla/vanilla_creatures/objects</code>. Like other raw files, mods can replace or introduce new sentences.

These tokens are used for [[Book#Titles|book titles]] and specific examples of [[Performer|performances]] such as songs, poems, or dances. It is unknown if the generating tokens can be used in other text sets to generate random words.

{| class="wikitable"

=== Dialogue tokens ===

Character dialogue uses its own set of tokens to reference data.
Scopes identify participants in a conversation and various forms of background information. They can be nested within each other in various cases. If the scopes refer to a historical object, it is expected [verify] that not using the TRANS_NAME argument will display the untranslated name.
Strings are the arguments for scopes, outputting a specific word based on the conversation data. In certain files, they are used by themselves with an implied scope.
