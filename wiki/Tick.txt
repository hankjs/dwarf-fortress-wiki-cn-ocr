'''Ticks''' are a species of ubiquitous above-ground [[vermin]], found in all non-freezing [[biome]]s. Their bite attack drains some [[blood]] out of the victim, though it is a negligible detail due to the difference in size between them and a [[dwarf]]. All ticks possess Legendary [[skill]] in [[Climber|climbing]].

Some dwarves [[Preferences|like]] ticks for their ''ability to expand''.
