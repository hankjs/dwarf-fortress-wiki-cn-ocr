'''Ibex men''' are the [[animal person]] version of the [[ibex]], found in [[savage]] [[grassland]]s and [[desert]]s (spawning in groups of 1-5 individuals), and are roughly the size of a [[dwarf]]. They are one of the few animal people species able to wear dwarf-sized armor and clothing, making them a good choice for [[adventurer mode|adventurer]]s starting in a dwarven civilization. Both ibex men and women have horns, but these are mostly decorative, as they can’t use them for goring attacks. Their hooves add some ”punch” to their kicks, though.

Some dwarves [[Preferences|like]] ibex men for their ''long horns''.
