'''Gigantic squids''' are huge versions of normal [[squid]]s. Unexpectedly, they are able to move on land for a brief time before air-drowning, so they could surprise [[fisherdwarf|fisherdwarves]]. Along with the [[gigantic panda]] and [[gigantic tortoise]], they are the only giant animals that are "gigantic", instead of merely "giant", to avoid confusion with their real-life relatives.

Some dwarves [[Preferences|like]] gigantic squids for their ''ability to spray ink''.
