'''Slurry''' is a material used in [[paper industry|paper making]]. Slurry is created at a [[mill]] or [[quern]] from cloth [[plant fiber|plants]] and pressed into [[paper]] at a [[screw press]]. This also creates [[seed]]s.

The labor associated with making slurries is [[papermaking]], under crafts - ''not'' milling, as one might expect from the building.

Slurry is considered to be a [[glob]] in the [[Stocks]] menu.

Oddly enough, despite not being food, slurries are stored in the food stockpile as a paste.

Here is a workflow for making plant slurry:

* Build stoneworker's workshop ({{menu icon|b|o|t}})

* Produce stone quern using stoneworkers workshop (input: stone)

* Build quern ({{menu icon|b|o|f|q}})

* Add plant stockpile near your quern.

* Have your dwarves gather plants.

* Set a work order for your quern to produce 'slurry' if fewer than 10 'globs' exist. Specify "Adj" to be 'paper-slurry items.  (input: plants) (Note: You need a dwarf with the '[[Manager]]' role and an [[office]] assigned to use work orders. You can do that from {{menu icon|n}} Nobles and Administrators)

== Types of Slurry ==

The following plants can be turned into slurry:
* [[Cotton]]
* [[Flax]]
* [[Hemp]]
* [[Jute]]	
* [[Kenaf]]	
* [[Pig tail]]
* [[Ramie]]
* [[Rope reed]]

== Technical info ==

Slurry is the {{token|SOLID_PASTE|md}} state of [[plant fiber]] and its {{token|SOLID_PRESSED}} state is the [[paper]] itself. The structural material has <code>[MATERIAL_REACTION_PRODUCT:PRESS_PAPER_MAT:LOCAL_PLANT_MAT:THREAD]</code>  to tell the milling [[reaction]] to have slurry as the [[Reaction#Material reaction product|product]], and the slurry has [[Reaction#Reaction classes and products|class]] <code>[REACTION_CLASS:PAPER_SLURRY]</code> to turn the [[glob]] into paper of the same material.

== Bugs ==

* Slurry stored on the floor in food stockpile (not in a barrel/pot) will trigger a [[Cleaning|Clean job]], resulting in the glob being destroyed.{{bug|9884}}  As a work-around, one can use the custom stockpile feature to disable paste from being stored in food stockpiles, and the slurry will remain safely in the quern/millstone until need at a screw press.
