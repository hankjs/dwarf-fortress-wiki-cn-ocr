A '''Stoneworker's workshop''' is where [[stone carver]]s create [[stone]] objects, such as [[statue]]s and [[furniture]], as well as where [[stonecutter]]s create stone [[block]]s. [[Quern]]s, [[slab]]s and [[millstone]]s can ''only'' be made at this [[workshop]].

Dwarves with the [[engraving]] labor also engrave [[memorial]] [[slab]]s at this workshop. 

Depending on the generated world, some musical [[instrument]]s (or certain pieces of them) may or may not be made here.

The workshop can be made out of any building material and requires any of the [[stoneworker]] labors: [[stone carving]], [[stonecutting]], [[stone engraving]], or even [[masonry]] (which isn't even used at the workshop).

==Notes==
*The name of this workshop will change if your fortress's primary race provides a custom value for the {{token|PROFESSION_NAME|c|STONEWORKER}} token.
*As it is cheap to build a Stoneworker's workshop, it can be useful to temporarily make one in any area where you have lots of stone you need to get rid of (e.g. future stockpile space) and then dismantle it when you are through.
*[[Clay]] boulders can not be used in place of stone.
