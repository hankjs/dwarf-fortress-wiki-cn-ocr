'''Giant monitor lizards''' are massive [[Creature|cousins]] of the common [[monitor lizard]] who can be found in [[savage]] [[tropical]] plains and [[forest]]s. They spawn individually and meander through the map, often paying little mind to [[dwarves]] in their vicinity. While over 15 times the size of the average dwarf, these reptiles are not particularly aggressive and don't go out of their way to kill people who approach them, but they will prove a challenge if provoked. Giant monitor lizards share their smaller cousins' rarity, and no more than 10 of them will spawn in the area before they are considered [[Extinction|extinct]]. They are considered exotic [[mount]]s, so you may see [[Elf|elves]] riding them into battle during [[siege]]s.

Giant monitor lizards can be captured with [[cage]] [[trap]]s and [[Animal trainer|trained]] into valuable [[pet]]s, being as worthy as other giant animals. Like their original counterparts, they are prolific [[egg]]-layers and a great candidate to be part of a fortress' [[egg production]]. Breeding them will quickly fill the fortress with giant lizards, who can be [[butcher]]ed into a very attractive amount of [[food]] and [[bone]]s when they reach their maximum size. Products made from giant monitor lizard parts are [[Item value|worth]] twice more than those of standard animals.

Some dwarves [[Preferences|like]] giant monitor lizards for their ''intelligence''.
