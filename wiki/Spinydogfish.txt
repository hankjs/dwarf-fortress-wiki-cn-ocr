'''Spiny dogfish''' are a species of [[Cartilage|cartilaginous]] [[Creature|fish]] who can be found in [[temperate]] and [[tropical]] [[ocean]]s. Half the size of a [[dwarf]], they provide a fair amount of returns when [[butcher]]ed. As non-[[vermin]] fish, spiny dogfish can't be fished by [[Fisherdwarf|fisherdwarves]], but can be caught with the use of a [[drowning chamber]]. Infant spiny dogfish are called ''spiny dogfish pups''.

Being cartilaginous, spiny dogfish won't provide [[bone]]s when butchered (but will provide a [[skull]]).

Some dwarves [[Preferences|like]] spiny dogfish for their ''dorsal spines''.
