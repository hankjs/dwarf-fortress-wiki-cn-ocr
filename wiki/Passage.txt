'''Passages''' are [[cavern]] features that connect one cavern layer to the next, being natural tunnels connecting two layers by [[ramp]]s and short, twisted tunnel sections. Passages can be easily sealed with a constructed [[wall]], and discovering what lies so many layers below may be worth the temporary risk of attack from [[forgotten beast]]s or the like. The [[announcement]] window will let you know you've found a downward passage even if you happen to discover it from the bottom.

Note:  Because of {{bug|6390}}, you may not see a ramp when the discovery of this is first announced.  You should [[channel]] that tile ''and the surrounding tiles'' (as it may not be ''exactly'' where the announcement placed it) to find it.
