'''Honey badger men''' are [[animal people]] variants of the common [[honey badger]] who can be found in [[savage]] [[tropical]] and [[desert]] regions. They spawn in groups of 5-10 individuals and may pose a threat to passing [[dwarves]] as, like their animal counterparts, they are prone to rage and may flip out at other nearby creatures. Like the normal honey badgers, they are also [[Steals food|food]] [[Thief|thieves]]. In terms of size, they are a little over half the weight of the average dwarf.

Like other savage animal people, they can join [[civilization]]s, become [[historical figure]]s, appear as [[visitor]]s and be playable in [[adventurer mode]].

Some dwarves [[Preferences|like]] honey badger men for their ''fearlessness'' and their ''tenacity''.

'''Honey badger men''' are very loyal creatures, especially towards [http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e2JXgQxiDYo&list=PLXX7Rp0iXj0klmNiJH79gzGAsdI0BHvm8 demigod] [[leopard seal man|leopard seal men]], following them without question, as long as the reason for following them is entertaining the world and not [[goblin]] genocide. Although they do not know how to make weaponry of any sort, they do get particularly confident when armed with [[pike]]s, even suicidally so.

Some dwarves say they are nasty, but others don't give a flip.
