{{release notes}}

:We have a Fortress Mode patch this week which adds in a bunch of graphics that we added to Adventure Mode beta as well as some bug fixes. We are still primarily working on getting the last few features for Adventure Mode finished so there won't be regular patches for Fortress Mode quite yet. But we wanted to do this as a little thank you to the Fortress players who have been extremely patient while we've been busy with Adventure Mode. We are getting close now!

:'''A word of warning:''' There is a risk of losing your saves with this update. There's been an issue related to the Steam C++ redistributable, which we think may be resolved. We recommend playing the new patch with a save file you don't mind potentially losing just in case there's any issues that come up in the next few days. We will update you when this risk is no longer an issue.
