If you dislike [[buzzard|buzzards]] because those flying pests steal all the food from your fortress where they can lay their claws on... You'll certainly hate their bigger, stronger and smarter relatives, the '''buzzard (wo)men'''.

While these animal people generally show little interest in attacking your dwarves directly, their presence causes serious disruption to the operation of a fortress; they don't mind attacking any food-hauler who does not voluntarily "donate" the hauled food; scare the hell out of your cattle and so on. They even "help" you harvesting outdoor crops, of course for their own gain.

The real bad part is that these intelligent creatures can not be tamed and dwarves refuse to butcher and eat them.

Some dwarves [[Preferences|like]] buzzard men for their ''striking red face''.
