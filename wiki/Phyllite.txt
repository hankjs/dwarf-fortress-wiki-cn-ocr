'''Phyllite''' is an unremarkable [[metamorphic]] [[stone]].

It is not magma-safe.

In real life, phyllite rocks are an early form of low-grade metamorphism of slate or other clay-mineral shales with a high content of planar minerals like mica.  It too, as in dwarf fortress, is fairly unremarkable in the grand scheme of things.
