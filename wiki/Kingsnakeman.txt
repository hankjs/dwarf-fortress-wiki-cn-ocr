'''Kingsnake men''' are [[animal people]] variants of the common [[kingsnake]] who can be found in various [[savage]] biomes. They spawn in groups of 1-3 individuals and are generally content to keep to themselves. In terms of size, they are a little over half the weight of the average [[dwarf]].

Like other savage animal people, they can join [[civilization]]s, become [[historical figure]]s, appear as [[visitor]]s and be playable in [[adventurer mode]].

Some dwarves [[Preferences|like]] kingsnake men for their ''coloration'' and their ''habit of eating other snakes''.
