'''Hungry heads''' are flying [[Creature|pests]] found in the third [[cavern]] layer, in groups of 5-10 individuals, and similar to [[crundle]]s and [[troglodyte]]s in their abundance and lethality, being different only in that they can fly and have only three outside body-parts (a head and two wings). Despite having no visible eyes, they have full 360° vision. They do not pose much danger to adventurers or decently equipped military, though their ability to fly can make them a job-interrupting nuisance in [[fortress mode]] and you may occasionally lose a civilian [[dwarf]] to them if you do not take care.

Hungry heads possess a [[pet]] value of 50, but lack the necessary tokens to be [[Animal trainer|trainable]]. All members of the species possess Legendary [[skill]] in [[Climber|climbing]]. They can't be spawned in the [[object testing arena]].

Some dwarves [[Preferences|like]] hungry heads for their ''terrifying features''.
