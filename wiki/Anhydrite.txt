'''Anhydrite''' is a [[magma-safe]] [[stone]] of base [[value]] that is only found within various types of [[gypsum]]. In real life, anhydrite is essentially dehydrated gypsum, and on contact with water will immediately hydrate and soften; however in ''Dwarf Fortress'', anhydrite [[floodgate]]s are just as effective as floodgates made from [[granite]]. Oddly, unlike the gypsum in which it occurs, anhydrite '''cannot''' be used to make [[gypsum plaster]].
