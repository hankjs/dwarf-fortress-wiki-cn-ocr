'''Wombat men''' are [[animal people]] versions of the common [[wombat]], who can be found in [[savage]] [[mountain]]s and some [[temperate]] regions. They spawn in groups of 1-5 individuals and are generally content to keep to themselves. In terms of size, they are a little over half the weight of the average [[dwarf]].

Like other savage animal people, they can join [[civilization]]s, become [[historical figure]]s, appear as [[visitor]]s and be playable in [[adventurer mode]].

Some dwarves [[Preferences|like]] wombat men for their ''waddle''.
