A pregnant female dwarf can have a '''miscarriage''' under extreme circumstances, including being [[drink|dehydrated]], [[food|starving]], or sustaining a major [[injury]] while pregnant. This causes a strong negative [[thought#Wedlock|thought]], the same as losing an existing [[relationship|family member]].  With many other factors, your dwarf might [[tantrum|snap]], which in most cases will almost always cause some [[fun]].

Keeping women out of the military can help mitigate this (along with babies being carried into battle), as can ensuring that your food and drink stockpiles are kept sufficiently full. Jailed or otherwise incapacitated dwarves may still be at risk, though, due to the seemingly low priority of "Give Food" and "Give Water" jobs.
