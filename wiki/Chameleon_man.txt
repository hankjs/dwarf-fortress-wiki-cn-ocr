'''Chameleon men''' are [[animal people]] variants of the common [[chameleon]] who can be found in [[savage]] [[tropical]] and [[desert]] regions, spawning in groups of 1-5 individuals, and are generally content to keep to themselves. In terms of size, they are a little over half the weight of the average [[dwarf]].

Like other savage animal people, they can join [[civilization]]s, become [[historical figure]]s, appear as [[visitor]]s and be playable in [[adventurer mode]].

Some dwarves [[preference|like]] chameleon men for their ''ability to change color'' and their ''eyes''.

<!-- Reference: Pokemon Mystery Dungeon -->
In adventure mode, chameleon men will occasionally set up shops inside [[Dungeon_(zone)|dungeons]], and will go berserk if their trade goods get stolen. Despite their harmless appearance, said chameleon men will always be legendary fighters when provoked.

<!-- Reference: Cassette Beasts -->
Reports have surfaced of chameleon men with expertise in fire spontaneously turning and remaining blue.

<!-- Reference: Something that has probably actually happened, since chameleons have a clutch size of 40-50. -->
Instances were reported when a chameleon woman would join a fort as a monster slayer, eventually claim a nest box, and lay up to 50 eggs at a time, that dwarves would cook and eat.
