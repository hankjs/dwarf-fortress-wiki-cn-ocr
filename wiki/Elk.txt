'''Elk''' are [[Creature|animals]] who inhabit [[temperate]] [[grassland]]s and [[tundra]]s, appearing in groups of 3-7 individuals. Five times heavier than a [[dwarf]], they're benign meanderers who do little but wander around aimlessly, being relatively harmless and easy for [[hunter]]s to take down. They possess some sexual dimorphism, with the males having a pair of [[Horn|antlers]], though it doesn't give them the ability to gore enemies. They possess thick fur which provides them with increased insulation compared to most other animals, and their young are called ''fawns''.

Elk can be captured in [[cage]] [[trap]]s and [[Animal trainer|trained]] into exotic [[pet]]s. Given their large size, they provide a good amount of returns when [[butcher]]ed, making them valid targets for a [[meat industry]]. Products made from elk parts are worth [[Multiply value|twice]] more than those made from other, more common animals.

Some dwarves [[Preferences|like]] elk for their ''grace''.
