A '''magma flow''' is a special type of map tile found at the bottom of the [[magma sea]], forming the floor above [[semi-molten rock]]. Creatures can safely walk on the tiles as long as no [[magma]] is present, but since magma pools and volcanoes refill by spawning magma directly above magma flow tiles, they tend not to remain safely walkable for long.

Natural walls and floors dropped onto a magma flow by a [[cave-in]] will disappear. This happens in the same tick as a cave-in, and the magma flow will consume the entire column, no matter how high it is. Similarly, [[obsidian]] cannot be cast onto a magma flow tile, and instead both water and magma present will disappear in a puff of steam.

If the magma is cleared away (or if a large area is excavated beneath stone directly above semi-molten rock), the magma flow tiles will animate and sparkle just like the original [[23a:magma flow|magma flow]] from the earliest versions of Dwarf Fortress.
