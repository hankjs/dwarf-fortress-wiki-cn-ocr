A '''throne''' (called a '''chair''' when made out of [[wood]]) is a piece of [[furniture]] that dwarves use in their daily routines once built as a '''seat''' (the generic term).  A throne can be made from [[stone]] at a [[stoneworker's workshop]] with [[stone carver]], 3 [[metal|metal bars]] at a [[forge]] with [[blacksmithing]], [[glass]] at a [[glass furnace]] with [[glassmaking]], or from [[wood]] at a [[carpenter's workshop]] by a dwarf with the [[carpentry]] [[labor]] (where it's listed as a "chair").  The material has no effect on its functionality; all thrones work the same.  Note that for an equal skill level, wood chairs are produced faster than rock thrones{{verify}}, though different [[material]]s have different final base [[Value#Material_multipliers|value]] multipliers.

A built throne can be placed in the furniture menu ({{Menu icon|b|f|r|sep=-}}). A throne can only be placed [[inside|indoors]].

Seats, like [[table]]s, are an obvious part of [[dining room]]s -- Dining at a seat in a high-quality dining hall will give an (additional) happy [[thought]]. If a dwarf wants to eat, they will look for a free seat. If they don't find one, or one without a free table next to it, they will have an unhappy thought. Dwarves don't like to share tables - they will get an unhappy [[thought]] if the table in front of them is being used by someone else. Having enough seats and tables and placing them in an unambiguous 1:1 pattern avoids these bad thoughts.  Seats are also used to create [[office]]s (and throne rooms, essentially the same thing) for [[nobles]].
