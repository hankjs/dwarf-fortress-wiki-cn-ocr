One of the two mineral sources of [[fuel]], '''lignite''' is found in [[vein]]s in [[sedimentary layer]]s.  When processed at a [[smelter]] or [[magma smelter]], one unit of lignite produces 5 units of [[Fuel#The_two_sub-types_of_fuel|coke]].   If done at a regular [[smelter]], this processing requires one pre-existing unit of fuel (either [[Fuel#The_two_sub-types_of_fuel|charcoal]] or coke), leaving a ''net'' production of 4 fuel.

Lignite is flammable - if exposed to [[fire]] or [[magma]], an item made of lignite will burn for the better part of a year before [[wear]]ing away. Exposure to [[water]] (including rain) will extinguish it, unless it happens to be stored in a [[bin]].

Although no more materially valuable than any generic stone, by default lignite is considered an [[economic stone]], and will be reserved for coke production, unless changed in the {{k|z}}-Stone sub-menu. It otherwise behaves as an ordinary stone - if you don't need it to produce coke, you can use it to produce goods with a mason or stonecrafter.
