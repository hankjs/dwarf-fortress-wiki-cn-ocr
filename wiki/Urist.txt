{{D for Dwarf}}

:''This article is about the Dwarven name. For the weapon, see [[Dagger]].''

The first [[name]] '''Urist''' is generally accepted in the DF community as ''the'' generic dwarven name, and often used as a reference name if someone talks about a dwarf and doesn't have (or want to bother with) an actual name, similar to a generic Anglo/American called "Bob", a Russian being called "Ivan", or a Frenchman called "François", etc. etc. 

This first name is almost always paired with a last name with the [[wikipedia:Celtic onomastics|Gaelic surname prefix]] "Mc", e.g. "McMiner" or "McUselessNoble". The suffix of the surname is always a description of the dwarf or the dwarf's job, even though this is not a valid form for in-game dwarven names. The "Mc" probably stems from both the Scottish accents commonly given to dwarves in fantasy films and video games, and the stereotypes of Scots being drunk and violent, stereotypes also associated quite accurately with dwarves in ''Dwarf Fortress''.

==== Examples ====
:* Urist Mc[[Miner]] can't find his [[pick]]!
:* It's time for Urist McUseless[[Nobles|Noble]] to have an [[unfortunate accident]].
:* Urist McIdiot [[Dodging|dodge]]d into the [[magma]].

The correct pronunciation of "Urist" depends on dialect. Dwarves from your civilization will always pronounce it the right way. Everyone else is wrong.

== Origins ==
The origin of the name's popularity seems to be the tale "[http://www.bay12forums.com/smf/index.php?topic=15572.0 One Dwarf Against the World]," a well-received narrative style account of a hermit fortress played in the 2D version. That dwarf's full name was Urist Borushdumat (Raked-Roughness). Despite that dwarf having been female, the name is used for either gender of generic dwarf.

"Urist" is the [[dwarven language|dwarven]] word for "[[dagger]]", somewhat of a misnomer ''per se'', as dwarves really aren't that sharp.

== Other uses ==
{{main|Temperature}}
'''Urist''' is also the term for the [[temperature]] units used by [[Toady One]] and has since been adopted by players. 

It has also unofficially expanded to be the tongue-in-cheek unit of measurement for ''any'' dwarven measuring system. For example, an artifact [[value]]d at 100,000☼ (normally "dwarfbucks") could be valued ''"at 100,000 urists!"'', an item with [[weight]] of 50Γ could be described as "weighing 50 urists" (especially in very old versions, back before the weight unit was redefined to match the real-world kilogram), or a 10 x 10 tile room could be referred to as ''"100 square urists"'' in area. As long as it's understandable in context, it works just fine.
