'''Pandas''' are large [[Creature|mammals]] found roaming alone through [[temperate]] [[forest]]s. They are noted for their distinctive black and white coloration, and their dependence upon [[bamboo]]; they will only appear in areas where bamboo grows, as its serves as their exclusive diet. Pandas are fairly docile and will generally run away from [[Dwarf|dwarves]], but they aren't entirely benign and will defend themselves if threatened. They are large enough to cause significant damage or even kill an unarmed [[peasant]].

Pandas can be captured in [[cage]] [[trap]]s and [[Animal trainer|trained]] into fairly valuable [[pet]]s. A trained or tame panda must be [[pasture]]d in a patch of bamboo (they won't eat any other kind of grass), otherwise they will die of starvation. The [[Elf|elves]] will not bother to mention this detail to you when they bring pandas for [[trade]]. They can be kept as livestock and [[breeding|bred]] for a [[meat industry]], however their dietary requirements will necessitate excessive micromanagement. Their [[butcher]]ing returns are twice as valuable as common critters, but there are many easier and more lucrative options for livestock. 

In real life, the species is known as the "giant panda", but in-game they are referred to as simply pandas in order to better distinguish them from their [[Gigantic panda|savage counterparts]].

Some dwarves [[Preferences|like]] pandas for their ''striking coloration'', their ''big fluffy heads and bellies'' and their ''lazy nature''.
