'''Mog juice''' is an [[extract]] from [[moghopper]]s, which can be used in [[cooking]].

Mog juice is obtained with the "extract from raw fish" command at the [[fishery]]. This requires a [[captured live fish|captured live moghopper]] and a [[barrel]], and is done by a [[dwarf]] with the [[fish dissection]] labor enabled. Each moghopper yields 5 units of mog juice, and each unit has a [[value]] of 50☼ per unit. Extraction kills the moghopper.

Mog juice is currently the only obtainable product from fish extraction, but due to the rarity of moghoppers, it is not a staple of the dwarven diet.
