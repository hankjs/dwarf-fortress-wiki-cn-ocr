'''Consoler''' is a [[social skill]] used by dwarves while conversing. Dwarves that are particularly good at this tend to make friends easily and will often rise to [[mayor]]al positions. 

To train this skill, let dwarves idle and chatter amongst themselves. [[personality facet#DISCORD|Chaotic]] dwarves, [[personality facet#CRUELTY|cruel]] dwarves, [[personality value#STOICISM|stoic]] dwarves, and dwarves [[personality facet#SWAYED_BY_EMOTIONS|unswayed by emotions]] will never gain [[experience]] in this skill.
