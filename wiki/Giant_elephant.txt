'''Giant elephants''' are the even more massive [[Creature|cousins]] of the common [[elephant]], found in [[savage]] [[tropical]] [[forest]]s and [[shrubland]]s. 666 times heavier than a [[dwarf]], they are [[list of creatures by adult size#end of list|truly enormous]] to say the very least; not only are they eight times the size of regular elephants, they are even larger than [[megabeast]]s like the [[dragon]] or [[roc]]. They are by far the largest land-dwelling creatures in the game and even in the ocean are only matched by the [[giant orca]] and exceeded by the legendary [[giant sperm whale]].

As big as they are, giant elephants are as vulnerable to [[cage]] [[trap]]s as anything else, and like normal elephants, they can be [[Animal trainer|trained]] into pets. Like their smaller counterparts, giant elephants are trainable for both war and hunting. If you can train one, they make the best defense animals in the game; not much can stand against a giant elephant, let alone multiple of them. They also offer an almost unparalleled bonanza of [[butcher]]ing returns.

Letting your dwarves [[Creature#Agitation|agitate]] wildlife when your embark is host to giant elephants is, to put it lightly, not recommended, and ''[[Undead]]'' Giant Elephants will likely be one of the most <s>horrific</s> [[fun]] creatures you ever encounter. Consider use for [[Clown]] hunting.

Since they're "War Animals", "Hunting Animals" and "Exotic Mounts", they can also be fielded during sieges. They're used by human, elven and dwarven siegers as tanks - essentially, filling same tactical niche as [[Cave dragon|cave dragons]], except '''bigger'''.

Some dwarves [[Preferences|like]] giant elephants for their ''strength'', their ''amazing trunks'', their ''calves' spirited antics'', their ''tusks'', their ''great weight'', their ''social behavior'', their ''flappy ears'', their ''uprooting of trees'', their ''aggressive sparring'', their ''trumpeting'', their ''tool use'' and their ''self-awareness''.

<!-- Reference: ? -->
According to legend, in a great siege several humans mounted fortresses on the backs of these great beasts, and rode them into battle as weapons of war. 

<!-- Reference: "The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King" 2003 film, quote from Gimli -->
Despite their great size, slaying a giant elephant still only counts as a single kill.

<!-- Reference: ''The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers'', original 1954 novel -->
It's been rumoured that certain [[planter]]s are especially likely to have a [[Preferences|preference]] for giant elephants, and have even been known to recite [[Performer|poems]] about them.
