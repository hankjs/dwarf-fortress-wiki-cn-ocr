'''Phantom spiders''' are [[vermin]] that occur in [[Surroundings|evil]] forest [[biome]]s. Closely related to [[cave spider]]s, they produce webs that can be collected and woven into [[thread]] at a [[loom]], and bite [[creature]]s to inject a [[Syndrome|venom]] which causes numbness and dizziness for approximately one [[time|month]]. An [[animal dissector]] can use a caught phantom spider to make [[venom]]. Note that stripping an area of available [[tree]]s reduces the amount of webbing present, due to dwarves trampling it.

True to the creature's description, the sprite of the spider is partially transparent.

Some dwarves [[Preferences|like]] phantom spiders for their ''translucence'' and their ''creepiness''.
