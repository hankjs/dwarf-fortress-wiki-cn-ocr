'''Sweet pods''' are a [[underground|subterranean]] [[crop]] grown in [[spring]] and [[summer]]. Sweet pods can be [[milling|ground]] at a [[millstone]] or [[quern]] into [[dwarven sugar]] or [[plant processing|processed]] at the [[farmer's workshop]] into [[barrel|barrels]] of [[dwarven syrup]]. 

Sweet pods can also be brewed into [[Alcohol|dwarven rum]].

Five units of syrup are obtained for each sweet pod, but only one unit of sugar. However, sugar can serve as a solid ingredient in cooking, while syrup cannot.
