'''Frill sharks''' are [[Cartilage|cartilaginous]] [[Creature#Aquatic|fish]] that can be found in any [[ocean]] [[biome]]. They are as large as the average [[dwarf]] and provide an average amount of [[meat]] when [[butcher]]ed. As fully-sized creatures, they can't be fished by [[Fisherdwarf|fisherdwarves]], but can be caught with a [[drowning chamber]]. An infant frill shark is called a ''frill shark pup''.

Being cartilaginous, frill sharks won't give [[bone]]s if butchered (though they'll still provide a [[skull]]).

Some dwarves [[Preferences|like]] frill sharks for their ''needle teeth'' and their ''frilled gill slits''
