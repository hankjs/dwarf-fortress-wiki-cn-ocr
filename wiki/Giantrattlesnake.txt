'''Giant Rattlesnakes''' are the [[giant animal]] variant of [[rattlesnake|rattlesnakes]]. They are found in any non-freezing, [[surroundings|savage]] [[biome]]. While regularly sized rattlesnakes can pose a threat due to their venom, giant rattlesnakes' large size (nearly twice the size of a dwarf) compounds their risk factor.
