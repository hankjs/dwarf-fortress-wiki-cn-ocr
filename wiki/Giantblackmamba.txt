[[Black mamba]]s are an extremely deadly but small species of venomous snake whose bites to your dwarves cause short term [[syndrome|syndromic]] symptoms including dizziness, drowsiness, strong pain, fever, unconsciousness, complete paralysis, and death by suffocation soon after. '''Giant black mambas''' keep their basal creature's deadliness, but beef up their size to that of a full-grown [[tiger]]. Not only do they have no problem piercing through your dwarves' clothes, they have no problem piercing through most [[armor]] either, and may just as well end a bitten [[goblin|goblin spearman]]'s life by crushing his skull as by stopping his lungs. Luckily giant black mambas require 20 years of growth to reach full size, but only live 10 to 20 years, meaning they rarely reach their most imposing size. 

In the wild giant black mambas are solitary creatures that normally flee contact, but have a <tt>[PRONE_TO_RAGE:1]</tt> tag in their [[raw file|creature definitions]], which means that about 1% of the time they will flip out on anyone they see. Unless that dwarf happens to be a [[skill|great]] [[battle axe|axedwarf]] in full [[steel]] [[armor]], they probably won't survive the ensuing encounter. Excellent [[mass pitting|pit]] creatures, if not one of the most durable creatures of their size - better to not [[ambusher|approach]] them in the wild.

Some dwarves [[Preferences|like]] giant black mambas for their ''deadly bite'' and their ''aggression''.
