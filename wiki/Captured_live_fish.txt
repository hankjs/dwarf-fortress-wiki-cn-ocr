'''A captured live fish''' is caught using the "capture live fish" command given at a [[fishery]]. A [[dwarf]] with the [[fishing]] labor will then attempt to catch an aquatic [[vermin]] live using an available [[animal trap]]. The fish will then be placed into an available [[aquarium]]. Unlike normal fishing, which will be done at any suitable location, the "capture live fish" command will '''only''' capture fish from an explicitly designated [[activity zone#Fishing|fishing zone]].

Only ''vermin'' fish can be captured with this method. To capture regular-sized fish, underwater [[cage trap]]s are required. In addition, ordering your dwarves to move a captured regular-sized fish to an aquarium may result in the fish being instantly air drowned due to a bug.{{Bug|1590}}

Captured [[pond turtle|turtles]] and [[moghopper]]s can be used as [[pet]]s. A captured moghopper is also used to make five units of [[mog juice]] using the [[fishery]]'s "extract from live fish" command. This [[extract]] can be used for [[cooking]] and [[trading]].

This task will wait for an available animal trap forever, occupying a fishery when none are available. While the fishery waits, fish cleaners cannot perform their automatic task of preparing raw fish.

Note: a constructed animal trap can not be used unless it is deconstructed.

Unlike [[trapper|capturing land vermin]], trapping a fish does ''not'' fulfill the "doing something exciting" [[need]]. <!-- unless this changed since v47.05 -->
