'''Knowledge''' is a feature in ''Dwarf Fortress'' which is at the heart of decision-making by [[historical figure]]s. Historical figures can know about [[site]]s, events, [[regions]], other historical figures, [[creature]]s, and art forms, but also a number of academic [[topic]]s, as well as [[secret]]s.

== Overview ==
There's several types of knowledge in ''Dwarf Fortress''. Each historical figure will keep a list of these and whether they personally know them.

Knowledge can be spread through different methods, including books, observation, rumors, and apprenticeship.

In fortress mode, the knowledge that dwarves and other intelligent creatures possess can be seen after clicking them to open their overview screen and then in the "[[Skills]]" menu under "Knowledge."

== Historical knowledge ==

Knowledge of other historical features of your world, such as sites, people, regions and [[artifact]]s can be obtained by a historical figure through seeing those things, and hearing [[rumor]]s about them. In fortress mode, your dwarves' knowledge will be updated with each passing [[caravan]] as traders tell the latest tales about the world. Visitors and your dwarves also tell each other stories in [[tavern]]s. In adventure mode, knowledge is reflected in the [[Adventurer_mode#Quests|questlog]], and necessary for historical figures for them to be able to tell you the location of a place, or to form [[reputation]]-awarding opinions on you.

== Topics ==
{{main|Topic}}

Academic knowledge is handled through [[libraries]], where [[scholars]] ponder, discuss, and research [[topics]]. They may make discoveries and [[writer|write]] [[scroll]]s or [[quire]]s. Topics can be learned through reading about them, as well as through apprenticeship, where a teacher will teach the topics directly to their apprentice. Research itself is an extremely slow process, and it is recommended to use books or apprenticeship to further knowledge development. Academic knowledge currently has limited application, the prime effect being the unlocking of [[Book#Literary_Forms|literary forms]].

The nine main branches of knowledge are: mathematics, philosophy, history, geography, medical science, natural science, astronomy, engineering, and chemistry. These all have their own sub-categories, which usually require the base branch to discover.

== Art forms ==
{{main|Performer}}

Knowledge of [[Performer|art forms]] can be obtained by historical figures through observation of the performance, reading about them, and apprenticeship under a different performer.

== Secrets == 
{{main|Necromancer}}

Knowledge of secrets can be obtained though reading [[Book#Secrets|books and slabs]], or under the apprenticeship of a necromancer. Only [[Necromancer|the secrets of life and death]] are implemented; which give their purple practitioners a selection of different necromantic powers, and always the ability to [[Necromancer#Raise corpse/intelligent undead|raise undead]].
