There are several reasons why a dwarf or group of dwarves equipped with crossbows and with access to ammo will not train.
* The most likely reason is a lack of quivers - dwarves will no longer hold a stack of bolts to use with a crossbow.
* Dwarves must use the correct type of ammunition for their weapon.
* Dwarves will only train their crossbow skill if an [[archery target]] is available and marked for training usage.
* Squads must be assigned equipment (weapon, armor) and ammo (bolts).  They must be ''explicitly'' assigned a crossbow.  If they are assigned "ranged, individual choice", they will not practice archery, but they may still fire bolts in combat situations.
* Prior to .09, if you had an [[Arsenal Dwarf]], (s)he had to process all equipment changes.  With .09, the Arsenal Dwarf position is gone.
* '''Dwarves will only use Archery Ranges in their free time (if they're not set to TRAINING in a given month). It's best to consider TRAINING to mean combat training.'''
