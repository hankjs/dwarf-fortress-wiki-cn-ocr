'''Balance''' is a placeholder [[skill]] that has been coded into the game but which lacks a use or method of improvement. It is not associated with any [[labor]]s or [[profession]]s, and is a placeholder to be implemented as part of the combat overhaul underway in some future version of the game.

<blockquote>
"Balance is a measure of how much you can physically do at any one point in time.  Attacks, jumps, and various physical actions put you off-balance, and the more off-balance you are, the less swiftly, accurately, and powerfully you can move or act. 

Hence, the more different actions you try to juggle at a time, the more imbalanced you become.  Likewise, guarding or dodging makes you imbalanced, which gives a penalty to further dodging or attacks, making subsequent dodging less likely. How much balance any given action "costs", and how quickly it recovers could be a measure of Kinesthetic Sense and Agility (although separating out agility and dexterity may be warranted)."
