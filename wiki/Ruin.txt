'''Ruins''' ([[File:icon_site_ruin1.png]] [[File:icon_site_ruin2.png]] [[File:icon_site_ruin_dwarf.png]] [[File:icon_site_ruin_castle.png]] [[File:icon_site_ruin_castle2.png]] [[File:icon_site_ruin_castle3.png]] [[File:icon_site_ruin_small1.png]] [[File:icon_site_ruin_small2.png]]) are [[site]]s which will appear on the map when a player-made [[Fortress mode|fortress]] is [[abandon]]ed to ruin rather than retired, or when sites belonging to any civilized race are abandoned or destroyed due to invading [[army|armies]] or [[megabeast]]s. These abandoned fortresses and other [[site]]s will appear as {{Raw Tile|μ|#808080|#000000}} on the world and [[Adventurer_mode#Fast_travel|fast travel]] maps in both fortress and [[adventurer mode]]. Any sites that once belonged to the player race (or the player him/herself) (normally dwarves) may be reclaimed using [[reclaim fortress mode]].

In ASCII mode, mountain hall ruins will appear as {{Raw Tile|μ|0:0:1}}, hillocks ruins will appear as {{Raw Tile|μ|7:0}}, both of those will appear as {{Raw Tile|μ|5:0}} if taken over by night creatures. Fortress ruins will appear as {{Raw Tile|μ|7:1}}, or {{Raw Tile|μ|5:1}} if taken over by night creatures. Ruins of [[forest retreat]]s will appear as {{Raw Tile|μ|6:1}} or {{Raw Tile|₧|6:1}}, depending on what kind of terrain/biome they are on, and will appear as {{Raw Tile|μ|5:0}} or {{Raw Tile|₧|5:0}} respectively if taken over by night creatures. Ruins of a [[dark fortress]] will appear as {{Raw Tile|μ|0:1}} or {{Raw Tile|μ|5:1}}, or {{Raw Tile|μ|5:1}} if taken over by a night creature. Dark put ruins appear as {{Raw Tile|ª|0:1}}, or {{Raw Tile|ª|5:0}} if taken over. Human town ruins appear as {{Raw Tile|μ|7:0}}, or {{Raw Tile|μ|5:1}} if taken over. Hamlet ruins appear as {{Raw Tile|&#61;|6:0}} {{Raw Tile|≡|6:0}} {{Raw Tile|æ|6:0}} or {{Raw Tile|Æ|6:0}} depending on the land; or {{Raw Tile|&#61;|5:0}} {{Raw Tile|≡|5:0}} {{Raw Tile|æ|5:0}} {{Raw Tile|Æ|5:0}} if taken over. Castle ruins appear as {{Raw Tile|○|5:1}} if taken over.

Barring abandonment, ruins typically appear when a [[civilization]] which is at [[war]] with another civilization doesn't {{token|LIKES_SITE|e|x}} the type of site that they have just taken over, leaving only a tiny few straggler-forced converts that can be slain by beasts. Megabeasts such as [[forgotten beast]]s and [[titan]]s also appear to frequently kill and/or drive out the residents of, and take up residence in, dwarven fortresses. This has the potential of making those reclaims exceptionally [[fun]] depending on the monster. Abandoned settlements and such may or may not be reclaimed by their parent civilization during either [[world generation]] or gameplay.

See the [[map legend]] for more information on map symbols.
