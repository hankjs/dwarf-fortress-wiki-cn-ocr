'''Pond grabbers''' are quite small tentacled, clawed, aquatic [[Creature|monsters]] found in [[Caverns|underground]] bodies of water. They tend to hunt their prey in small groups of 3-5. They will generally leave you alone, but can wrestle and drown a [[dwarf]] startlingly easily. They also generally spend years in ponds, doing nothing and possibly blocking [[Giant cave spider|other, more interesting creatures]] from entering your caverns. It is best to defeat them at range with [[Crossbowman|marksdwarves]] if possible.

Pond grabbers possess a [[pet]] value of 50, but lack the necessary tokens to be [[animal trainer|trainable]]. Things made from their parts, however, can still be requested from the dwarven [[caravan]] thanks to them existing at the first cavern layer. They are notably biologically immortal and only die from violence or disease. They can't be spawned in the [[object testing arena]].

Some dwarves [[Preferences|like]] pond grabbers for their ''patience''.
