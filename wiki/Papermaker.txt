'''Papermaker''' is the skill associated with the papermaking [[labor]]. Papermakers can make [[sheet]]s of papyrus paper directly from [[papyrus]] reeds at a [[farmer's workshop]], or by pressing [[slurry]] at a [[screw press]]. Paper is used to produce [[books]] in the form of codices, quires, and scrolls.  

Treating animal hides with [[milk of lime]] will produce parchment, but this is performed by a [[Tanning|tanner]]. Making paper sheets is an alternative to parchment production and a major part of the [[paper industry]].
