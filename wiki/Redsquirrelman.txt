'''Red squirrel men''' are [[animal people]] versions of the common [[red squirrel]], who can be found in [[savage]] [[temperate]] [[forest]]s. They spawn in groups of 1-5 individuals and are generally content to keep to themselves. In terms of size, they are a little over half the weight of the average [[dwarf]]. All red squirrel men possess Legendary [[skill]] in [[climbing]].

Like other savage animal people, they can join [[civilization]]s, become [[historical figure]]s, appear as [[visitor]]s and be playable in [[adventurer mode]].

Some dwarves [[Preferences|like]] red squirrel men for their ''tails''.

<!-- Reference: Conker's Bad Fur Day -->
Red squirrel men do not commonly have "bad fur days". They are not known to date [[cv:Hare_man|rabbit women]] twice their size. They are also not [[cv:alcohol|alcoholics]]; or at least not to the extent of dwarves.
