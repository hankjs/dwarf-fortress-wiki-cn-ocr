'''Walruses''' are [[amphibious]] [[creature]]s who can be found in [[arctic]] [[ocean]]s, in groups of 3-7 individuals. They are 25 times the size of a [[dwarf]] but are shy and benign, preferring to flee from attackers than try and fight them, which makes them relatively easy prey for a [[hunter]]. In the event they do fight back, a walrus will defend itself by attempting to stab the enemy with their tusks. An infant walrus is called a ''walrus calf''.

Walruses can be captured in [[cage]] [[trap]]s and [[Animal trainer|trained]] into valuable [[pet]]s. Because of their large size and fairly long lifespan, they can serve as a good source of exotic livestock in a [[meat industry]], with their tusks serving as a source of [[ivory]]. If you try and breed them, note that it takes a walrus five years to reach its full size, considerably longer than most [[domestic animal]]s.

Some dwarves [[Preferences|like]] walruses for their ''tusks'' and their ''whiskers''.

{{D for Dwarf}}
<!-- Reference: "I Am the Walrus" song by The Beatles -->
It is rumored that eggmen can be sometimes found near walruses. This, however, is yet to be confirmed for DF.

<!-- Reference: "Wally Walrus" character from "Woody Woodpecker" cartoon series -->
Some dwarven scientists also suggest that walruses' mortal enemies are the red-headed woodpeckers, as these birds will frequently steal their food, destroy their homes, and even go so far as to not let a walrus get a single minute of sleep. The reason for such behavior is still a mystery.

<!-- Reference: ? -->
You should never obey the walrus, whichever elf said that should have Armok [[magma|smite]] them.
