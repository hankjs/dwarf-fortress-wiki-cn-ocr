'''Gorlaks''' are small, [[good]]-aligned sapient [[Creature|humanoids]] encountered in [[cavern]] areas. Despite their appearance, they are benign, and so mostly harmless, although sometimes will cause job cancellations{{bug|3348}} and occasionally make weak attacks against animals or sleeping [[dwarves]]. They are easily dispatched by even an average civilian dwarf. 

Gorlaks are able to join [[civilization]]s (usually dwarven), making them appear as [[visitor]]s, and are playable in [[adventurer mode]] in a similar fashion to [[animal people]]. Before beginning an adventure as a gorlak or enlisting one into your military, note that they have special considerations for [[armor]] usage, as they do not have a torso—a gorlak's limbs connect directly to its head. While gorlaks may equip body and leg wear, they are equipped in the head slot while offering no head protection, only serving to take up space and provide coverage for limbs. As an example, though gorlaks can equip breastplates, the lack of a torso means they ''don't actually offer any protection'' while taking up the "shaped" armor spot for the head, preventing the wearing of a helm. An armor set consisting of a helm, mail shirt (for upper limb protection), gauntlets, and high boots will be the equivalent of full coverage for a gorlak.

Gorlaks cannot kick, and as such don't learn the kicking combat skill via combat training, and may not be able to learn or use the skill at all.

They can't be spawned in the [[object testing arena]].

Some dwarves [[Preferences|like]] gorlaks for their ''impressive tusks'', their ''stimulating conversation'' and their ''helpful guidance''.

They are often said to be found traveling with [[Troll|a blue troll]] and a [[Children|small girl]], and are occasionally found to only have one eye. These cycloptic Gorlaks are admired by some humans [https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2917301608 to the point where they primarily depict them as such in engravings.]
