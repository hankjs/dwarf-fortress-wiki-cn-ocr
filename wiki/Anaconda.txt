'''Anacondas''' are solitary [[creature]]s found in [[tropical]] [[wetland]]s. They carry no poison [[syndrome]] unlike other snakes, but are distinct for being among the largest mundane species of snake in the game, being nearly twice the [[size]] of a [[dwarf]]. Like other snakes, they continuously grow throughout their entire lives, reaching their maximum size at the age of 20, though some anacondas may die of old age as soon as they reach the age of 10, where they're about as large as a [[goat]].

Anacondas can be captured in [[cage]] [[trap]]s and [[Animal trainer|trained]] into exotic [[pet]]s. Their lack of limbs mean they give little [[meat]] and [[bone]]s if [[butcher]]ed, but they provide a significant amount of [[prepared organs]] in turn. Products made from anaconda parts are worth [[Multiply value|thrice]] more than those made out of common animals. Unlike most reptiles, they give live birth instead of laying [[egg]]s.

Some dwarves [[Preferences|like]] anacondas for their ''great size''.

It doesn't want none unless you have buns, so you should be safe as long as you have no bread on you.
