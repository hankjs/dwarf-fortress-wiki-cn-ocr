'''Giant eagles''' are the [[Giant_animal|over-sized]] version of [[eagle]]s, found in the same wide array of [[savage]] [[biome]]s. They can be extremely annoying to an early fortress due to their ability to fly over your fortress defenses and kill your unarmed civilians. Unlike [[giant kea|other aerial pests]], giant eagles will generally not path into your fortress, and usually only attack if provoked. They may also appear as [[mount]]s during a [[siege]], resulting in a highly-maneuverable and dangerous squad of attackers. All giant eagles are born with Legendary [[skill]] in [[Climber|climbing]].

Captured giant eagles may be kept as exotic [[pet]]s, requiring substantial time and effort to tame. Unfortunately, they cannot be trained to increase their combat effectiveness. [[elf|Elven]] [[caravan]]s may offer to trade tame giant eagles if the elven [[civilization]] is situated in a mountainous area.

Giant eagles are relatively useless for [[egg production]] thanks to their small clutch sizes, but they are a viable choice for your [[meat industry]], yielding a respectable amount of food without [[grazer|grazing]]. Once hatched, giant eagle hatchlings take roughly one year to reach adulthood.

There is a current bug where tamed animals that have the [FLYING] tag won't actually fly. Once tamed, your giant eagles will remain earthbound and never take to the sky, which makes them somewhat less deadly than they would otherwise be.

Some dwarves [[Preferences|like]] giant eagles for their ''high soaring''.
