'''Chickens''' are common [[Domestic animal|domestic poultry]] known for their [[egg]]s and meat. Male chickens are known as ''roosters'', female chickens are known as ''hens'', and young chickens are known as ''chicks''. Like other domestic poultry, they spend most of their time rooting around on the ground, eating [[vermin]].

Hens will lay between 4-15 eggs when provided with a [[nest box]]. A rooster is required to fertilize the eggs, but fertilization is not guaranteed. Once hatched, chicks will grow into adults in 1 year.

Economically speaking, [[egg]]s are a very good source of food (1 egg = 1 meal) - starting out with 5 hens and roosters on embark is an easy way to keep a new fortress fed until larger scale food production can be established. Long-term, [[egg production]] remains a viable food industry, though other domestic birds (such as [[turkey]]s) produce more eggs and meat.

Most fortresses will collect the eggs as fast as they are laid, but this will prevent expanding your chicken population. To deliberately expand the population (and provide chickens for a [[meat industry]]), simply forbid one or more stacks of eggs by selecting a nest box in use and press [[File:Button forbid.png]] to forbid the eggs from being collected. Alternatively, deny your dwarves access to the nest boxes with locked doors, or forbid [[stockpile|stockpiling]] and [[cooking]] the eggs. Be warned that large groups of chickens will require a significant amount of space for them to roam, otherwise they will quickly get into [[overcrowding|fights]]; additionally, failing to collect eggs may rapidly lead to a [[catsplosion#Birdsplosion|chicksplosion]].

Some dwarves [[Preferences|like]] chickens for their ''clucking'' and their ''scratching''.

For some reason, roosters give a skull more often than anything else; this may be because the butcher holds them by the throat when cutting. It's a well-known fact that chickens can run even after being beheaded. For more info, see the [[Domestic_animal|domestic animals' page]].

Chickens are often observed crossing [[road]]s, with [[scholar]]s speculating about their motivations.
