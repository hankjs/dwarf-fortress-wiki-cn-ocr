'''Sterling silver''' is a [[silver]]-based [[alloy]], mixed 3:1 with [[copper]], used to create [[furniture]] and miscellaneous objects. It must be made by combining [[bar]]s of pure [[metal]]; it cannot be [[Smelter|smelted]] from [[ore]] directly. The value of sterling silver is equal to that of its components, so this metal is only really useful if you want to cater to a [[preference]] or satisfy a [[demand]]. It does, however, possess a striking white color very similar to [[marble]].

== In real life ==

Pure silver is too soft to make functional items out of, so it is alloyed with other metals (primarily copper, but germanium, zinc and platinum can substitute) to make sterling silver – increasing its strength while retaining pure silver's ductile properties and natural beauty. While sterling silver is most commonly used for cutlery and ornamentation, some manufacturers make musical instruments from it, citing the unique sound character of the metal. Its naturally aseptic qualities also make it ideal for non-disposable surgical equipment.
