The '''organizer''' [[skill]] is used by some military dwarves, by [[manager]]s (an appointed [[noble]] position), and by [[scholar]]s. Higher skill reduces the time taken for:
* military dwarves to organize training
* the [[Manager]] to manage work orders in the Manager menu

Because the organizer skill is trained when leading military demonstrations, you may find that a lot of your soldiers with no civilian skills become Administrators during downtime.

Rarely, the organizer skill is also used by [[scholars]] working on "[[Topic#History|personal interviews]]".
