'''Alexandrites''' are semi-precious [[gem]]s found as small [[cluster]]s in [[granite]], [[marble]], and [[schist]].

In the real world, alexandrite is a variety of [[chrysoberyl]], and is commonly used in lasers for laser hair removal.

{{D for Dwarf}}
Many dwarves have tried, but smelting [[amethyst]], [[pearl]], [[ruby]], and [[sapphire]] won't result in any alexandrite.
