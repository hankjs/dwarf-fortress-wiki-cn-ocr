'''Strawberries''' are an [[above ground|above-ground]] [[crop]]. They can be [[plant gathering|gathered]] nearly anywhere, and are common items when [[trading]] with non-[[dwarven]] [[caravan|caravans]]. The plant can be [[food|eaten raw]], [[cooking|cooked]], or [[Thresher|processed]] into fruit. The fruit can then be [[food|eaten raw]], [[cooking|cooked]], or [[brewing|brewed]] into [[Alcohol|strawberry wine]]. They are much like an above-ground version of [[plump helmet]]s, having the same [[value]] and uses. Keep in mind that they must be brewed from the {{DFtext|Brew Drink From Fruit}} task, rather than the {{DFtext|Brew Drink From Plant}} task.

Strawberry crops are one of the few crops with multiple usable products: harvesting a strawberry crop will yield ''strawberry plant'', a plant used in cooking, and [[Thresher|processing]] a ''strawberry plant'' will yield ''strawberry seeds'' as well as ''strawberry'' fruit, which can be cooked or brewed. As always, cooking a strawberry plant does not yield seeds, and despite this, they are enabled for use in cooking by default. This is a great way to accidentally run out of seeds, although it is easy to obtain more by [[plant gathering|gathering]] them in the wild. [[Brewing]] with strawberries does yield seeds.

Strawberries can be planted and harvested in farm plots year-round.

Strawberries are stored in spice barrels/pots.

Some dwarves [[Preferences|like]] strawberries for their ''vivid red color''.
