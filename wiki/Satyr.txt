'''Satyrs''' are [[fanciful]], intelligent [[creature]]s found in certain [[good]]-aligned [[forest]]s. Standing at the size of a [[dwarf]], these goat-legged creatures spawn rarely, in groups of 3-5 individuals who will do little else but wander the area aimlessly. If approached by a fortress' inhabitants, satyrs will flee rather than pose any threat unless cornered, in which case they will fight with punches, kicks, scratches, bites and by goring the enemy with their horns. They are a male-only race - no female satyrs exist - and are also [[Immortality|immortal]], only dying to violence.

Satyrs are sapient and can open unlocked [[door]]s, though they will rarely do much else than accidentally get caught in [[trap]]s. They are capable of speech and can be spoken to in [[adventure mode]], though they will likely not have much to say. Satyrs possess a [[pet]] value of 250, but lack the necessary tokens to be [[Animal trainer|trainable]] (and even if [[Modding|modded]] to be trainable, the fact they are intelligent creatures will lead to [[Animal trainer#Taming_intelligent_creatures|strange behavior]]).

Their [[evil]] counterparts are the [[foul blendec]]s.

Some dwarves [[Preferences|like]] satyrs for their ''woolly legs''.

{{D for dwarf}}

In mythology, satyrs were traditionally depicted as young men with the ears and tail of a horse. Satyrs in ''Dwarf Fortress'' are more akin to a different class of being entirely: They're fauns, you dork.

==Trivia==
*[[File:satyr_sprites.png|right]]Initially, the premium version had a sprite for a child satyr. It was later removed from the game, because satyrs are adults at birth.
