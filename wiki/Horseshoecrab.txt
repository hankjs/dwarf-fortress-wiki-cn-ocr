'''Horseshoe crabs''' are [[creature]]s found inhabiting [[ocean]] [[biome]]s. Smaller than a [[chicken]], they are unable to endanger your [[dwarves]] and make ideal defensive training partners in [[adventurer mode]], being nearly harmless save for any lucky hits to the face. Unlike most animals, they can neither be [[Animal trainer|trained]] nor possess any [[Pet#Pet value|pet value]], and a [[butcher]]ed crab will yield only a single piece of [[meat]] and [[fat]].

Some dwarves [[Preferences|like]] horseshoe crabs for their ''ability to hide in sand''.

Contrary to their name, they are not wearable by horses.
