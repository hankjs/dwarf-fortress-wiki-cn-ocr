'''Forest retreats''' ([[File:icon_site_forest_retreat_1.png]], [[File:icon_site_forest_retreat_2.png]] or {{Raw Tile|î|#FFFF00|#000000}}, {{Raw Tile|¶|#FFFF00|#000000}} in ASCII mode) are [[site]]s created by [[elf|elven]] [[civilizations]], little more than various large, unnatural-looking trees given [[religion|particular importance]] by their inhabitants, with the elves living and conducting business from the canopy. They also tend to have orchards. Forest retreat ruins appear as [[File:icon_site_ruin_forest_retreat1.png]] and [[File:icon_site__ruin_forest_retreat2.png]] (or {{Raw Tile|μ|6:1}} and {{Raw Tile|₧|6:1}} in ASCII mode).

Features of retreats include tree houses, shaping trees, market trees, tavern trees and the Home Tree. Tree houses are quite literally that, large trees with floor-like structures of branches where elven citizens loiter around. Shaping trees are used for producing naturally-grown wooden [[finished goods]] and tend to have assorted imported items littering the canopy, even including foreign clothing too big for them to wear. Market trees are their equivalent to shops. Unlike most features, market trees tend to have various market stalls set up underneath the tree instead of in the canopy. Tavern trees are similar to market trees, with tables, chairs, instruments, and a tavern keeper underneath a huge flat canopy growing out from a single trunk (and they can be truly enormous). The Home Tree is where the local religious leaders and other [[noble]]s can be found, and it contains large circle-shaped "node-like" structures spreading out away from the tree with paths of branches connecting them. Sadly, you can't conquer the pesky little tree-huggers by claiming the site for yourself and kicking everyone off the Home Tree, unlike taking over a [[hamlet]].{{bug|8001}}
