'''Turkeys''' are a species of [[domestic animal|domesticated]] [[creature]] who can be brought on [[embark]] or found in the wild, inhabiting [[temperate]] [[wetland]]s. Males are called ''turkey gobblers'', females are called ''turkey hens'' and hatchlings are called ''poults''.

[[Domestic animal#Comparison of domestic poultry|Compared]] to other domestic poultry, turkeys are the largest in size, being a better [[food]] source than the likes of [[chicken]]s. Turkeys take two years to reach their full weight, while the slightly smaller [[blue peafowl]] and [[goose|geese]] take only one year. They lay the most [[egg]]s in average out of all domestic birds (12, compared to the average 10 eggs of the [[duck]] and 9 of the [[guineafowl]]), making them the best domestic birds for [[egg production]]. Having both genders of turkey around allows one to breed them fairly quickly, though [[framerate]] can be negatively impacted by [[catsplosion#Birdsplosion|plentifully]]-peeping poults. As with other tame animals, if many turkeys are confined in a small area, they can become [[overcrowding|overcrowded]] and start fights. Since poults need no food, and have no practical utility until mature, they are generally best [[cage]]d, where they cannot eat FPS by doing line-of-sight checks until they are ready for egg laying or [[Butcher|slaughter]]. Putting a couple in a cage in the [[dining hall]] gives dwarves who like turkeys happy thoughts, as well.

Wild turkeys can be captured with [[cage]] [[trap]]s. [[Animal trainer|Training]] them will render them completely tame.

Some [[Dwarf|dwarves]] [[Preferences|like]] turkeys for their ''wattle'', their ''snood'' and their ''gobble''.
