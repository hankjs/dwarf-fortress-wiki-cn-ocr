"'''Goblinite'''" is an unofficial term for the [[metal]] and [[clothing]] resources that can be picked from off the [[corpse]]s, and severed [[body part]]s, of your enemies. Traditionally, this means [[goblin]] corpses, but new developments in [[diplomacy]] have made it possible to mine new veins of goblinite. Depending on the fortress, such items may be an important supplement to normally-produced or -traded [[armor]], [[weapon]]s, and [[clothing]]. The clothing content of [[siege]]s can almost single-handedly provide an entire fortress with clothes (albeit with the occasional [[wear|Xsuspiciously axe-shaped holeX]] in them), while [[melt|melting]] down weapons and armor can make up for a lack of ore at an embark site. Even useless items, like wrong-sized clothing or weapons made of inappropriate [[material]]s, can always be sold to the next [[caravan]].

The type of loot your enemies helpfully supply will depend both on the civilization and the race. The civilization will determine the type of items they bring. This can include items [[Weapon#Foreign weapons|dwarves can't make themselves]], which could be a very useful high-quality iron [[whip]], a mere curiosity like a leather turban, or a useless silver [[halberd]]. The race will determine what [[Clothing#Size|size]] the clothing and armor are. These items will generally be low-quality, except in the case of warlords, mercenaries, or races that particularly [[Ethics|value craftsmanship]], like humans or other dwarves. A warlord's master-quality gear can be quite useful, as long as it's something like an iron [[spear]] or helm and not a copper [[short sword]] or wooden [[low boot]].

Raids aren't necessarily homogeneous, either. A siege might include the allies or other races who live alongside your enemies. Angering a human city might mean you're attacked by a few humans, but many of their [[animal person]] allies. While a goblin force will almost always consist mainly of goblins, it can also include the occasional [[Thief#Goblin snatchers|adopted]] member of another race. These characters will generally be wearing the same sort of items as their compatriots, but sized appropriately. A troll fighting alongside goblins will be wearing the same sort of clothing as the goblins, but it [[Clothing#Size|will be too large for dwarves to wear]]. Attacking enemies can also include mercenaries, who might be any intelligent race, and have any sort of equipment.

Many races also ride [[mount]]s, which generally don't have equipment, but are helpfully [[Butcher|made of]] delicious [[meat]] and useful [[bone]] and [[leather]]. (Technically, so is everyone, but dwarves have pesky [[Ethics|moral objections]] to butchering anything more intelligent than a cat.) If you [[Captured creatures|capture]] these mounts in a [[cage trap]], you can [[Animal trainer|train]] them, but they'll always be hostile to your fortress, and can even cause [[Losing|Fun]] [[loyalty cascade]]s. The main use would be training the [[animal trainer]] skill or simply allowing you to easily slaughter the captive mounts, or you could sell unintelligent mounts in [[cage]]s to the next passing [[trade caravan]]. If you really ''must'' have your own [[beak dog]]s, however, with some careful micromanagement you can [[Breeding|breed]] enemy mounts, and their offspring won't be inherently hostile once trained.

==Goblins==
[[Goblin]]s are always hostile to dwarves, and can't ever be reasoned with. That's not a bad thing, since goblins generally make their weapons, armor, and shields out of useful [[copper]], [[iron]], [[silver]], and ([[bismuth bronze|bismuth]]) [[bronze]]. Goblins mainly use the same sorts of weapons as dwarves, but can also have [[large dagger]]s, [[whip]]s, [[flail]]s, [[scourge]]s, [[scimitar]]s, and [[bow]]s and [[arrow]]s. Their clothing is also handy, since it's the correct [[Clothing#Size|size]] for dwarves to wear. All of these can be used as-is, although some of the exotic weapons, like bows and the various whip-like weapons, have odd [[combat skill]]s that don't match up with any dwarf-made weapons, making them a bit of a dead-end long term. Alternately, the metal equipment can be [[Melt item|melted down]] to serve as the raw material for superior, dwarf-made arms and armor.

[[Thief#Goblin snatcher|Goblin thieves]] will only have a [[large dagger]] if they have any weapon at all and rarely wear any armor to speak of, but they do bring a [[bag]] that holds seeds or flour just as well as a dwarven child.

Goblin invaders often ride various creatures from the [[cavern]]s. On one hand, this means potentially fun (or [[losing|Fun]]) pets like [[blind cave bear]]s or [[jabberer]]s. On the other hand, dwarves can simply dig down to the caverns and capture these creatures themselves.

==Elves==
If you anger the [[elves]] by clearcutting trees, or disregarding their [[Elf#Trading|particular taboos while trading]], they may ineffectually attempt to go to war with your dwarves. Elves wear [[Clothing#Size|the same-sized clothing]] as dwarves, but that's about where their usefulness ends. They make their weapons and armor out of [[wood]], which will serve dwarves [[Material science#Material and item properties|just as poorly as it served the previous owners]]. Their most useful weapons are [[bow]]s, but they use a different [[combat skill]] from dwarves' own inexpensive and easily-made [[crossbow]]s, and force you to scavenge or trade for [[arrow]] [[ammunition]] to use them. Elves have a grisly habit of making crafts out of their slain enemies, so you can occasionally get an amusing ring or bracelet made from elven or goblin bone or hair.

Elves often ride interesting land animal mounts from the [[Surroundings|savage and good-aligned]] [[Biome|forests and jungles]] they typically settle in, including [[Giant animal|gigantic]] or [[Unicorn|fanciful]] animals of all sorts. This can be a source of [[giant tiger]] guards for your fortress, or perhaps just some tasty and valuable ☼Unicorn roast☼.

==Humans==
It's a bit harder to anger [[human]]s. You'll have to [[Mission|attack their settlements]] or [[trade caravan]]s, although dwarven [[civilization]]s occasionally end up at war with them in [[world generation]]. Like goblins, humans make their weapons, armor, and shields out of [[copper]], [[iron]], [[silver]], and ([[bismuth bronze|bismuth]]) [[bronze]]. Because humans [[Ethics|value craftsmanship]] almost as much as dwarves, these items tend to be a bit better [[quality]] than goblin-make. However, unlike goblins, human-sized [[Armor|clothing and armor]] are [[Clothing#Size|large-sized]], too large for dwarves to wear. Humans use a very wide variety of weapons, including [[Weapon#Foreign weapons|unusual weapons]] that dwarves can't normally make. Like goblin-made weapons, this is great if they bring something useful like a [[whip]], but many of these weapons require oddball [[weapon skill]]s. Unlike goblins, humans also wield many weapons that are simply [[Weapons#Size|too large for dwarves to use]].

Humans frequently ride mounts, but they're usually boring [[Creature#Livestock and Domestic Animals|domesticated animals]] like [[horse]]s and [[One-humped camel|camel]]s. They do occasionally bring war-trained [[grizzly bear]]s or [[giant animal]]s, though.

==Other dwarves==
Going to war with [[dwarf|dwarves]] is harder than you'd expect. Even if you [[Civil war|somehow end up at war]] with your home [[civilization]], they won't ever attack your fortress. You'll need to offend another dwarf civilization, usually by [[Mission|attacking them on the world map]] or killing their [[trade caravan]]s. Once you do, dwarves are deadly foes, since they will have [[Quality|well-crafted]] weapons and armor made of any [[weapons-grade]] metal, including [[steel]]. While any civilization can have [[artifact]]s, dwarves are much more likely to have them, since dwarf civilizations are the primary source of such items. Obviously, these are useful dwarf-sized items, but you'll need to take them from the cold, dead hands of their previous owners first!

Dwarves can occasionally ride mounts, almost always [[Creature#Livestock and Domestic Animals|domesticated animals]].

==Kobolds==
[[Kobold]] civilizations will always attack dwarves. However, they never attack in large numbers, only sending [[Kobold thieves|thieves]], singly or in small groups. If these thieves have any armament at all, it will be a [[copper]] [[dagger]]. Even their clothes are useless, since kobolds are [[Clothing#Size|smaller than dwarves]]. 

When kobold adventurers and mercenaries can show up in other races' raids, they can have equipment made from any [[weapons-grade]] metal, even steel.

==Animal people==
[[Animal people]] can show up in siege-like attacks two different ways.

While [[Creature#Above ground|above-ground]] animal people usually show up naked as small groups of wandering neutral creatures, the same way as animals do, they can also be part of any other civilization. These civilized animal people will show up alongside their allies in sieges, carrying weapons and armor of similar quality and materials and riding the same sorts of mounts. (Sometimes the mounts can be silly; [[cardinal men]] living alongside humans can be riding horses rather than flying faster and higher under their own power.) These animal people can wear clothing or armor [[Clothing#Size|appropriate to their size]] (which can be dwarf-sized, or too small or large, depending on the race), but often only carry a weapon and shield.

[[Creature#Tribesmen|Subterranean]] animal people live in tribes of their own in the [[cavern]]s. Hostile tribes of animal people will often migrate into the caverns from open map edges, sometimes in great numbers. These tribes are mostly armed with spears and shields, with the occasional [[blowgun]] mixed in. These will always be minimum quality, but they can be made of any [[weapons-grade]] metal, including [[steel]]. These tribes are one of the few sources of blowguns, but blowguns are even more useless than bows, due to the shortage of [[blowdart]] [[ammunition]].

==Undead==
If you settle near a [[Tower (necromancy)|necromancer's tower]], they'll occasionally send forces of [[undead]] to attack you, led by [[intelligent undead]] or a [[necromancer]]. These attacking forces are especially heterogeneous, and can include [[zombie]]s, intelligent undead, and necromancers from any [[Creature#Civilized|civilized race]]. The type, quality, and materials of the attackers' armament appears to depend on the race of the head necromancer back at the tower, usually a human or dwarf, although reanimated [[historical figure]]s seem to have equipment appropriate to the [[civilization]] they lived in before dying. A dwarf necromancer's sieges might even include [[steel]] equipment. Otherwise, the [[Clothing#Size|size of the clothing and armor]] and the types of weapons the invaders use will depend on their race.

Attacking necromancers occasionally bring a [[book]] with them. If this book contains [[Book#Secrets|the secrets of life and death]], reading it will turn the reader into a necromancer themselves, so you might want to sequester such reading material from your [[library]] unless you want your citizens embracing undeath.

==Goblinite ore==
{{D for Dwarf}}

Goblinite is an important ore, good for iron, copper, bronze, and/or silver. Unlike other ores, goblinite is not restricted to any particular layer, though it is most often found on or near the surface. It occurs in [[Thief|small clusters]], which can sometimes be dealt with by a solitary dwarf with a [[pick]], and [[Ambush|veins]] and [[Siege|large clusters]] which require greater effort to excavate and process. The discovery of a large vein of goblinite is cause for celebration, a holiday known as [[goblin christmas]]. Also, there have been some reports of goblinite spontaneously condensing in the vicinity of [[trap|strategically positioned catalyzing sharp edges]].

Once the [[Combat|mining]] is complete, the goblinite can be [[Forbid|unforbidden]] and your dwarves can carry it off to the [[stockpile]]. To yield the precious metal, each piece of ore must be designated for [[melt]]ing and processed at a [[smelter]]; the yield is typically less than that of normal ores of iron and copper, but can be an important resource in a particularly metal-poor location, provided you have sufficient [[Military|fuel]]. Many [[caravan]]s prize [[Goblin|raw goblinite]], along with its attendant wrappings.

As of the current version dwarves and goblins have the same adult body size, therefore allowing goblinite to be equipped directly without melting and reforging as an early or cheap source of low quality armor for a fortress.

Recent advances in the field of dwarven fashion have increased the demand for the [[clothing|wrapping paper]] in which goblinite is often packaged.  While the dwarves of yore would often throw this into the [[magma]] while muttering about [[FPS]], the young dwarves of today have been spotted wearing it.
