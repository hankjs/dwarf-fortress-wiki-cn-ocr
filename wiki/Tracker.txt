[[File:tracker_preview.png|right]]'''Tracker''' is a [[skill]] used in [[adventurer mode]] which allows an adventurer to track [[creature]]s. Higher levels let you spot more tracks and help distinguish different tracks. The only time that this skill is not being trained is when your adventurer is sleeping, waiting, or having too much [[fun]]. As a result, it will typically reach legendary status by the end of an in-game week.  [[Historical figure]]s that have done scouting, beast hunting or wandering in the past always seem to have some levels of this skill.

In [[fortress mode]], this is used by [[scholar]]s who are [[naturalist]]s.  [[Visitor#Monster_slayer_and_beast_hunter|Monster slayers]] also have this skill, but it is unknown if or how it helps them pursue their personal goals.

In adventure mode, certain types of tracks can be identified when close enough to them. Track icons are seen in the top-right corner of the screen. Any tracks made by the controlled character will have a green outline, while any tracks made by others will have no outline at all. There are five general types of tracks that can be seen: broken vegetation, humanoid prints, beast prints, footwear prints and unknown messes. The prints can come in the form of tracked liquids or imprints in terrain.
