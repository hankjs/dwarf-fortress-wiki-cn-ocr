''For information regarding [[material]]s known as lime, see [[calcium carbonate]] and [[quicklime]].''

'''Lime''' is one of the many genera of [[tree]]s found above ground in most [[tropical]] [[biome|biomes]]. Lime [[wood]] is displayed in-game as brown, and produces brown products. 

Some [[Dwarf|dwarves]] [[Preferences|like]] lime trees for their ''fruit''.
