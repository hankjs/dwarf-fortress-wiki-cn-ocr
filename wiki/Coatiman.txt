'''Coati men''' are [[animal people]] variants of the common [[coati]] who can be found in [[savage]] [[temperate]] and [[tropical]] [[forest]]s. They spawn in groups of 1-5 individuals and, much like their common precedential type specimens, are prone to [[Thief|stealing]] whatever items they can find and getting beaten to death by random civilians - sometimes even livestock - on sight. This will give your refuse stockpile's savior a fairly severe bad thought, just like killing any other sapient creature. In terms of size, they are a little over half the weight of the average [[dwarf]].

Like other savage animal people, they can join [[civilization]]s, become [[historical figure]]s, appear as [[visitor]]s and be playable in [[adventurer mode]].

Some dwarves [[Preferences|like]] coati men for their ''curiosity''.
