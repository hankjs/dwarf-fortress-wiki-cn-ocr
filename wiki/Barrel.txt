'''Barrels''' are storage units that, like [[bin]]s and [[bag]]s, conserve [[stockpile]] space by containing several items of the same type. They can be made out of [[wood]] at a [[carpenter's workshop]] (requires one [[log]] for each barrel) or forged from [[metal]] at a [[forge]] (requires 3 [[metal]] [[bar]]s). Non-magma [[forge]]s also require one [[bar]] of [[fuel]]. Graphically, if a barrel is empty, the sprite will show an empty barrel with no lid; if it is filled with a specific type of item, the top of the barrel will have the matching items sticking out of the top. If the barrel contains a liquid, the barrel will have no lid and show the top of the liquid it contains, as well as having a tap attached to it, making the barrel resemble a keg. If the barrel contains content such as [[slurry]], paste or [[tallow]], the top of the barrel will have a lid:

When a barrel is emptied, it may be used again or stored in a Furniture stockpile with type Barrels, plus appropriate materials (Wood is under Other materials), and qualities allowed. For more information on managing barrels in stockpiles, see [[using bins and barrels]].

For most uses, barrels can be replaced by a [[large pot]], which has the same storage capacity (and requires no [[wood]] or [[metal]]) and is only one quarter as heavy ''as a barrel made of the same material''. Typical stone pots will be 33% heavier than wooden barrels. Fire clay "stoneware" pots weigh the same as a wooden barrel, while earthenware pots are lighter but must be glazed.

Barrels are used in building [[dyer's shop]]s and [[ashery|asheries]]. Using a valuable masterwork or [[artifact]] barrel to build one of these buildings can significantly increase fortress [[wealth]].

Barrels can hold up to 60 prepared meals, plants, or cheeses, 30 pieces of meat or fish, any number of units of brewed [[alcohol]] (but only a single stack), 100 units of [[lye]] or [[milk]], or 6000 eggs regardless of size. However, alcohol brought at [[embark]] will be in barrels that only contain up to 5 units each; this due to alcohol barrels allowing only 1 stack and embark items coming in stacks of 5 units or less.

The name of a barrel can vary by circumstance: the name of an empty barrel is the material it is made of, e.g. "tower-cap barrel", otherwise a barrel will be named for what it contains with its material appended, e.g. "dwarven wine barrel (tower-cap)". Additionally, if a barrel is assigned for use in a stockpile, the number of the stockpile will be appended, e.g. "dwarven wine barrel (tower-cap) <#1>".
