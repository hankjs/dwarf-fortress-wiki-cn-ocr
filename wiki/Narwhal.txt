'''Narwhals''' are marine [[creature]]s who inhabit [[arctic]] [[ocean]]s. They spawn one at a time and do little but meander through the water, minding their own business. Narwhals are huge, weighting over a ton, but are benign and will rarely pay attention to [[dwarves]] even if they fall into the ocean. If forced to fight for whatever reason, they will attempt to stab the enemy with their tusks or slap them with their tails. Narwhals will occasionally "tusk" one another as a greeting, bumping their tusks together in a similar manner to how [[cat]]s greet others by head-bumping. An infant narwhal is called a ''narwhal calf''.

Being fully-sized creatures rather than [[vermin]], the only way to fish narwhals is to trap them on land, typically with the use of a [[drowning chamber]]. Due to their huge size, they provide a great amount of returns when [[butcher]]ed, with their tusks serving as a source of [[ivory]].

Some dwarves [[preferences|like]] narwhals for their ''horns''.

[[Human]]s would tell you [[unicorn]] horns are actually the severed tusks of a narwhal. Dwarves know better, however, as they're professionals in extracting horns from actual unicorns as well as narwhals if needed. Both are equally delicious when cooked into biscuits.

Some [[dwarf|dwarves]] [[preferences|like]] narwhals for their ''commotion'' or their ''awesomeness''.
