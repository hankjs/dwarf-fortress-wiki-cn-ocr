'''Potash''' is a [[wood industry|wood-based]] product which has applications in [[farming]], as well as production of mid- and high-end [[glass industry|glass]] products.

==Producing potash==
Potash can be created at an [[ashery]] by a [[dwarf]] with the [[potash maker]] labor enabled. This process requires one unit of either [[ash]] or [[lye]].

Since lye is produced ''from'' ash, it is extra work to use lye to produce potash, but lye gets the job done just the same if you wish. Either method requires one initial unit of [[wood]], which is then turned into ash by [[wood burner|burning logs]] at a [[wood furnace]], and then lye can be optionally produced at an [[ashery]]. While making ash directly into potash takes less time and uses fewer workers, making ash into lye first has several advantages:
* It keeps more dwarves busy, potentially satisfying [[need]]s
* It provides extra [[skill|experience]] (and associated [[attribute]] increases) to the workers
* Lye can be stockpiled in much less space (100 units per [[barrel]], compared to only 10 [[bar]]s of [[ash]] per [[bin]])
* Lye can also be used to make [[soap]]

Potash is produced in [[bar|bars]] with no quality level. These bars are stored in bar [[stockpile]]s, and are viewable in the stocks screen under "bars."

==Uses==
Potash can be used to [[Farming#Yield and Fertilization|fertilize]] a [[farm plot]], increasing the stack size of harvested plants. Doing so can help cut down on the need for large farms, which may result in less labor overall.

Alternatively, potash can be further processed into [[pearlash]] at a [[kiln]] or [[magma kiln]]. This material is necessary if you wish to produce [[glass]] products of [[clear glass|clear]] or [[crystal glass|crystal]] quality. Because potash is a wood-based product, [[elves]] will refuse to [[trade]] it.

==Real world==
[[Wikipedia:Potash|Potash]] refers to a wide variety of potassium-bearing salts, first produced in roughly 500 CE. In modern times, they are used primarily in production of fertilizer, though they were once part of glass and soap production. While modern production methods have developed, this substance was once produced by soaking plant ash in a pot full of water, thus the name ''pot-ash'', which in turn gives the name to the element ''potassium''.
