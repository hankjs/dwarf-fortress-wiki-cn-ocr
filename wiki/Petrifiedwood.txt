'''Petrified wood''' is a brilliant red [[stone]] found in small clusters in sedimentary layers, which is [[magma-safe]]. Petrified wood is no longer [[wood]], but stone, so you cannot make [[wood]]en items from it. [[elf|Treehugger]]s will be perfectly happy to trade items made of it, as well. Petrified wood is notable for being the least [[density|dense]] [[economic stones|non-economic]] [[magma-safe]] stone.

<!-- Reference: Minecraft development -->
While it is possible to create [[slabs]] out of petrified wood, these slabs possess no remarkable properties, and certainly not any that would transcend the pataphysical bounds of the game's world.  Bay 12 has shown no indication that they will be made unobtainable in a future release.
