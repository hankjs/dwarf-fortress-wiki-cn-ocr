'''Giant leeches''' are super-sized versions of the common [[leech]], who inhabit [[savage]] [[pool]]s and [[lake]]s. While their original counterparts are just [[vermin]], these [[creature]]s are over 3 times larger than a [[dwarf]]. They spawn individually and are not particularly aggressive, but are not benign and will attack other creatures (including dwarves) who provoke them, potentially killing them. However, due to their lack of [[bone]]s, they are fairly vulnerable to damage and can be killed rather easily. Being bitten by a giant leech may cause it to suck some [[blood]] out of the victim.

Giant leeches can be captured in [[cage]] [[trap]]s and [[Animal trainer|trained]] into [[pet]]s, possessing the standard giant creature pet value. They are born adults and cannot be permanently tamed. Due to their lack of limbs, they produce very few products when [[butcher]]ed, making them a subpar choice for a [[meat industry]] despite being born instantly fully-sized. They are exotic [[mount]]s and may be witnessed being ridden by [[Elf|elves]] during [[siege]]s.

Some dwarves [[Preferences|like]] giant leeches for their ''feeding habits''.
