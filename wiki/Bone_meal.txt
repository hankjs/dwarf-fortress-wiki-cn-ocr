'''Bone meal''' is the resulting powder one winds up with after grinding up [[bone]]s.

==Fortress Mode==
At present, bone meal cannot be acquired in fortress mode. The only sign of its existence is the custom [[Stockpile#Food|food stockpile]] option for bone meal that does not actually do anything except confuse the occasional wayward player; perhaps that is how you ended up at this page in the first place. Actual ingame bonemeal isn't stockpiled properly, unless you mod bones to have token POWDER_MISC_CREATURE. 

However, [http://www.bay12forums.com/smf/index.php?topic=13513.msg123926#msg123926 Toady has suggested] that it may eventually be used as a [[farming|fertilization component]], much like [[potash]]. Producing it in a future version of ''Dwarf Fortress'' would be simplicity itself: simply [[miller|mill]] leftover [[bone]]s at a [[millstone]] or [[quern]].

==Adventure Mode==
Bone meal frequently appears in [[night troll]] lairs and [[minotaur]] labyrinths in [[adventurer mode]]. It currently has no use and appears to be nothing more than a prop. Although obviously made of bone, {{token|BONECARN}} creatures have never yet been observed consuming it.

==Real Life==
In reality, bone meal is made by grinding animal bones into a powder and is used as a fertilizer for plants and as a nutritional supplement for animals.
