This occurs when a miner attempts to dig out a tile that was designated for digging but was subsequently removed by other means.

Several situations have been observed to generate this message:
* A miner prepares to dig out a tile, but the tile immediately above is channeled away
* A miner prepares to remove a ramp tile, but nearby digging causes it to collapse
* A tile containing a tree sapling is designated for channeling, and the tree matures to full size
