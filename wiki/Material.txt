'''Materials''' are the wide array of base resources from which objects can be created.  Different materials have different base properties (including [[Value#Material_multipliers|value multipliers]] which can significantly affect the [[value]] of the item - a [[gold]] [[throne]] is worth more than an identical-quality [[lead]] one, for example).

Not every end-product can be made of all materials, and similar materials may have very different properties  - for instance, [[obsidian]] is the only [[stone]] that can be used to make stone-based [[weapon]]s, only [[magma-safe]] stones will not melt when immersed in [[magma]], and [[fire imp]] [[leather]] will not burn. While nearly all metals can be made into furniture and crafts, only a select few can normally be made into [[weapon]]s and [[armor]]. These metals are generally called weapon-grade metals. This alone doesn't necessarily give these materials a higher base value, but it may make them worth more to the player and their fortress in a practical sense.
{{catbox|Materials}}
Some dwarves have [[preference|preferences]] for one material over another - they receive a happy [[thought]] when working with the material, tend to produce higher-[[quality]] results, and perceive items (or rooms) made of the material as higher-[[quality]], which can also give them more happy [[thought]]s, e.g:

{{DFtext|Unib Rulushlikot likes [[rhyolite]], [[silver]], [[amber opal]], [[persimmon]] [[wood]] and [[giant emu]] [[leather]].|2:1|links=1|linkcolor=3:1}}

General groups of materials include, but are not limited to:

:* [[Stone]]   [[File:Gabbro_sprite.png]] / {{Tile|•|0:1}}
:* [[Wood]]   [[File:Pine_logs_sprite.png]] / {{Tile|▬|6:0}}
:* [[Metal]]   [[File:Iron_bar_sprite.png]] / {{Tile|≡|7:0}}
:* [[Glass]]   [[File:Clear_crystal_glass.png]] / {{Tile|♦|3:1}}
:* [[Leather]]   [[File:Leather_sprite.png]] / {{Tile|ß|6:0}}
:* [[Cloth]]   [[File:Cloth_sprite_preview.png|32px]] / {{Tile|º|7:1}}
:* [[Bone]]   [[File:bone_sprite.png]] / {{Tile|²|7:1}}
:* [[Shell]]   [[File:shell_sprite.png]] / {{Tile|²|2:0}}
:* [[Gem]]   [[File:Cut_green_jade_sprite.png]] / {{Tile|♦|2:1}}
:* [[Wax]]   [[File:Liquid_Premium.png]] / {{Tile|≈|6:1}}

Certain materials tend to be geared toward making certain items - while stone, wood, metal, and glass can be made into similar furniture, there are some items which are normally restricted to certain materials.  For example, [[bed]]s can only be made out of wood, and [[bin]]s and [[bucket]]s cannot be made out of stone.  Cloth and leather can both be made into clothing, but leather can also be used to make [[armor]]. Gems are largely for [[decoration|encrusting]] finished items made from other materials.  Of over two dozen different [[metal]]s and [[alloy]]s, only a handful are usable to make [[weapon]]s. If a [[dwarf]] is under a [[strange mood]], they will be given the ability to construct certain objects with materials that wouldn't normally be possible, such as a "[[yellow diamond]] [[armor stand]]".

In all cases, each group of materials is divided into many possible sub-types of material; there are, for instance, 11 pure [[metal]]s, another 14 [[alloy]]s, scores of different types of [[stone]] and well over 100 different types of [[gem]]s.  It is best to look up each individual category, or particular material, to become familiar with its value and what it can and cannot be used for.
