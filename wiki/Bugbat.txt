'''Bugbats''' are small, flying [[creature]]s who inhabit the second and third layers of the [[caverns]], appearing in swarms ranging from 5-15 individuals. Only half the size of a [[kobold]], these weird-looking critters will spend their time flying through the underground, fleeing from [[Dwarf|dwarves]] who approach them; they are benign and will rarely fight back if confronted. All bugbats are born with Legendary [[skill]] in [[Climber|climbing]].

Bugbats can be captured in [[cage]] [[trap]]s and [[Animal trainer|trained]] into low-value [[pet]]s, reaching their full adult size at 2 years of age, and should be [[butcher]]ed by then for a maximum amount of returns.. They are prolific breeders and appear in large numbers, meaning it's easy to set up a bugbat farm relatively quickly. 

Unlike most creatures, they can't be spawned in the [[object testing arena]].

Some dwarves [[Preferences|like]] bugbats for their ''freakish insect heads''.
