'''Bronze''' is an [[alloy]] of [[tin]] and [[copper]], which can be used to create all metallic items in the game.

== Smelting ==
Bronze can be made at the [[Smelter]] or [[Magma smelter]] using one of the following recipes:

* from [[ore]]: 1 [[Cassiterite]] + 1 [[Native copper]], [[Malachite]] or [[Tetrahedrite]] = 8 Bronze bars
* from [[bar]]s: 1 [[Tin]] bar + 1 [[Copper]] bar = 2 Bronze bars
== Use ==
Bronze can be forged into [[weapon]]s and [[armor]], and has [[Weapon#Material|material qualities]] very close to [[iron]]. Bronze can also be used to make [[furniture]] and other objects at a [[metalsmith's forge]]. It has a [[value]] of 5 and uses the same ingredients as [[fine pewter]] (which also has a value of 5). If you find yourself short of [[tin]], use this metal to make your objects of art instead of using [[fine pewter]]. If you are using ores to smelt bronze, you can produce 8 bars of weapon-grade metal with one unit of [[fuel]], making it an extremely useful material.

Alternatively, copper and tin can also be alloyed with [[bismuth]], in order to make the alloy [[bismuth bronze]]. While this doesn't improve the properties of the materials, it does result in a modest increase in [[value]] and cuts the cost in tin in half. 

The one major drawback of bronze compared to iron is that it cannot be used to make [[anvil|anvils]].

== Material properties ==
As mentioned before, bronze has material properties that are very similar to those of [[iron]], and is a significant improvement over [[copper]], except for blunt weapons where its superior edge properties are virtually irrelevant. If your fortress is in an area without significant quantities of iron ore, then bronze is a very good substitute. However, the material properties of bronze are inferior to those of [[steel]] in virtually every way.

The properties of [[bismuth bronze]] are identical in every way to standard bronze, the only differences are that items made from bismuth bronze are 20% more [[value|valuable]] (×6 vs. ×5), and the [[color]] of bismuth bronze items in-game is yellow rather than brown.
