[[File:v50_food_preview.png|right]][[Dwarves]] may be [[alcohol]]ics, but a dwarf cannot live on drink alone; they also need '''food'''. Hungry dwarves are indicated by: [[File:status_hungry_icon.png]] / {{Tile|↓|6:0}}. Unfed dwarves will progress from hunger to starvation and, ultimately, to death.

* Note that a "Food" [[stockpile]] includes consumables of all types and varieties: food, drink, and ingredients which must be further cooked or processed to be consumed, as well as a few non-consumables (e.g.[[venom]]s, and [[lye]], among others).

== Mechanics of eating and hunger ==
Dwarves require about 2 units of food each season. Dwarves that go without food will do the obvious: become increasingly hungry, work more slowly, become more and more unhappy, and eventually [[death|die]] of starvation. Hungry dwarves that cannot get at fortress resources will steal food from any [[caravan]]s that arrive; the merchants do not particularly care, but it is added to their expenses when the caravan leaves the map. Additionally, when starving, dwarves will catch and consume [[vermin]] to survive, resulting in an unhappy thought.

Dwarves will forgo food, drink, and [[sleep]] for a while to complete tasks they are currently performing; how long they will go on depends on their [[personality]], but dwarves will generally not knowingly endanger their lives to finish a job. Dwarves without a current job will perform these activities if they are even a little thirsty, hungry, or drowsy, and will only snap to "No job" once they have done so. The only task that can actually lead to death by preventing a dwarf from covering their vital necessities is a mother trying to find her [[children|infant]]{{verify}}.

Dwarves who don't get enough exercise will quickly become fat, a change that can only be seen by examining their [[thoughts and preferences]] screen. Not surprisingly, fat dwarves are slower at moving around, but the extra fat provides additional insulation from extreme temperatures, a small amount of additional protection against attacks, and longer "burn time" when exposed to [[fire]]. A dwarf's fat stores are depleted by the mere fact of existing, but this happens very slowly. As a dwarf becomes hungrier, they use up more fat, and will die when their reserves are completely exhausted. Fat dwarves can be made fit by giving them more physical and less intellectual things to do; a [[hauling]] regimen works wonders, for instance, possibly leaving some players wondering why it's so hard for people to shed weight in real life, when all they have to do is move [[stone]] from place to place.

==Detailed mechanics==

Hunger increments by 1 during each game tick ''(i.e. 1,200 per day, 33,600 per month, 403,200 per year)''. This rate doubles if the dwarf is a mother carrying her child. When it reaches certain thresholds, the following things happen.

:* {{Tooltip|40,000|34 fortress days}} - dwarf starts considering getting something to eat (1/120 chance per tick) if idle
:* {{Tooltip|45,000|38 fortress days}} - dwarf decides to go get something to eat if idle
:* {{Tooltip|50,000|42 fortress days}} - dwarf starts flashing "[[Status icon|Hungry]]"
:* {{Tooltip|65,000|55 fortress days}} - dwarf gets an unhappy thought about being hungry, cancels current job to get something to eat
:* {{Tooltip|75,000|63 fortress days}} - dwarf starts flashing "[[Status icon|Starving]]", begins hunting for vermin
:* {{Tooltip|85,000|72 fortress days}} - dwarf gets an unhappy thought about being starving
:* {{Tooltip|100,000|85 fortress days}} - dwarf starts burning stored fat; when this is completely depleted, the dwarf dies of starvation

Completing an Eat job decreases the relevant counter by 50,000 (to a minimum of zero), though it may also be decremented additional times during the job's progress. Dwarves will pick up whatever food is closest in the max(x,y,z) + min(x,y,z)*0.414 metric.

Being starving for even a single [[time|tick]] will cause a [[miscarriage]] among pregnant dwarves.

== Thoughts ==
There are a number of good and bad [[thoughts]] associated with food. Food cooked from or consisting of ingredients the dwarf [[preferences|likes]] will generate a happy thought. High-quality food will improve this happy thought, making a good [[cook]] a valuable addition to the fort. Dining in a high-quality setting will also bring a happy thought, making a legendary [[dining room]] an easy way to bring up happiness.

On the other hand, eating the same food over and over again will make the dwarf tire of it, and they will crave new dining. Having a particularly limited dining selection will cause this thought to manifest, more likely early in a fortress's life. For this reason, it is important to get your food industry running, to provide more of a selection to the dwarves. Additional food of most categories can also be purchased from a [[caravan]].

== Food groups ==
Food can be divided into several food groups; the state of the fortress's food reserves can be seen on the [[status]] screen, with the 2 important groups being 'drink' and 'other' (includes prepared meals). Any sort of accurate count will require a [[bookkeeper]]. The same goes for the {{k|k}}-stocks screen that gives a fully detailed overview.

*[[Plant]]s can be [[farming|farmed]] or [[plant gathering|gathered]], and are also the only food group besides [[honey]] that can be processed into drink. Farms are reliable and (usually) easily extendable sources of food, and generally form the backbone of most fortresses' food production.
*[[Meat]] can be sourced from [[meat industry|livestock]], [[hunting|hunted]], [[cage trap|caught live]] and then killed for [[arena|military training]], or stripped from siege [[mount]]s. Meat is more difficult to procure, but comes with important secondary resources ([[leather]], [[fat]], [[bones]]) and provides more variety than plants at a significantly easier rate. Terrestrial [[vermin]] don't produce meat.
*[[Creature#Aquatic|Fish]] can be caught, either via [[fishing]] or [[drowning chamber|fishing chambers]]. This is the most dependent of the industries, requiring a body of water (be it an [[ocean]], a [[lake]], or a [[river]]). Larger fish caught via fish traps are slaughtered, and their parts counted as part of the meat industry.
*[[Egg]]s can be sourced from a [[egg production|hatchery]]. Any [[tame]] [[Egg_production#Egg-laying_Animals|egg-laying]] female animal will do so occasionally when allowed access to an unclaimed [[nest box]], including very exotic animals like [[alligator]]s and [[roc]]s. These eggs can then be cooked.
*[[Milk]] can be [[Milker|milked]] from certain tame female animals, including the more exotic ones like [[kangaroo]]s and [[tapir]]s. Milk can be cooked or processed into higher-value [[cheese]].
*[[Honey]] and [[royal jelly]] can be produced via [[beekeeping]], and can be cooked or processed into [[mead]].

Note that most food is subject to [[Miasma#Food_rot|rotting]] if not stored properly.
