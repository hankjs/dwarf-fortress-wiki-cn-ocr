'''Sperm whale men''' are [[animal people]] counterparts of the common [[sperm whale]], who live in [[savage]] [[ocean]]s. 

They are by far the largest of the animal people – half the weight of a fully-grown [[dragon]], and roughly 33% larger than a [[giant]]. This makes taking them on very dangerous, but since they live in the water and are generally not aggressive, you'll be hard-pressed to have a sperm whale man problem – unless you have embarked on an [[evil]] [[ocean]], but in that case, you brought that on yourself. 

Like sperm whales, they have a 1/101 chance of being born with white skin instead of gray. They are also rarely subject to [[beaching]].

While they can learn and would be able to join [[civilization]]s, they never do so, as they are completely [[aquatic]] and cannot survive on the surface, and game doesn't feature aquatic civilizations.

Some dwarves [[Preferences|like]] sperm whale men for their ''teeth'' and their ''vengeful nature''.
