'''The basic point of [[fortress mode]] is:'''

*Defend your fortress ([[trap]]s/[[military]])
*Accumulate [[wealth]] and [[objects|treasures]]
*Build and sustain a bustling fortress impressive enough to attract your civilization's [[monarch]]
*Please that monarch so well that they [[Monarch#Becoming_a_Mountainhome|declare]] your fortress to be the [[mountainhome]] of your civilization

*Create a working [[military]] that [[goblin]]s and [[elves]] alike fear to even speak of
*Send [[squad]]s out on [[mission]]s to bring that fear home to them
* ... or to bring spoils or [[Mission#Artifact.2FCitizen_recovery|stolen valuables]] home to you
*Dig out the riches of the earth like [[platinum]], [[gold]], [[gem]]s, and [[adamantine|mythical materials]] previously only dreamed of
*Experiment with and experience the full depth of all game features
*Complete [[Megaprojects|megalomaniac construction projects]]
*Experiment with and/or discover [[stupid dwarf trick]]s
*Do it all over again with one skill-less dwarf in a [[terrifying]] biome
*Profit!
