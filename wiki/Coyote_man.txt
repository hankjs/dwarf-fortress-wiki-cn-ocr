'''Coyote men''' are [[animal people]] variants of the common [[coyote]] who can be found in a wide range of [[savage]] regions. They spawn in groups of 2-10 individuals and are generally content to keep to themselves, but may attack if approached. In terms of size, they are a little over half the weight of the average [[dwarf]].

Like other savage animal people, they can join [[civilization]]s, become [[historical figure]]s, appear as [[visitor]]s and be playable in [[adventurer mode]].

Some dwarves [[Preferences|like]] coyote men for their ''howling''.

{{D for Dwarf}}
Coyote men do not fixate on catching and consuming road runners, nor do they purchase or create any kind of [[cv:trap|traps]] to do so.
