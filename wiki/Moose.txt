'''Moose''' are large herbivorous [[Creature|animals]] who inhabit [[taiga]]s and [[temperate]] [[forest]]s, where they spawn one at a time. They are benign meanderers and generally avoid confrontation, and as such a [[dwarf]] [[hunter]] will typically emerge victorious when trying to hunt them. Moose possess significant sexual dimorphism, with males being over 1.5× larger than females and having access to a gore attack. Male moose are called ''bull moose'', while females are ''cow moose'' and their newborns are ''moose calves''.

Moose can be captured in [[cage]] [[trap]]s and [[Animal trainer|trained]] into fairly valuable exotic [[pet]]s. Given their large size, they make prime targets for a [[meat industry]] and a good choice for a breeding program. The returns shown to the right are those of a male moose - a female will give less due to being smaller. Trained moose are [[grazer]]s and therefore must be kept in a [[pasture]] in order to keep them fed and alive. Moose are exotic [[mount]]s, and may be seen being ridden by [[human]]s during [[siege]]s.

Some dwarves [[Preferences|like]] moose for their ''broad antlers'' and their ''large size''.

The '''Moose''' is capable of bringing down the toughest adventurers and soldiers, with hooves that cave in skulls with frightening ease. This creature has been dubbed the Scourge of Canada by survivors of such horrific encounters.

<!-- Reference: Monty Python and the Holy Grail -->
Moose have also been known to bite female dwarves attempting to carve their initials into their flanks. Nó realli!
