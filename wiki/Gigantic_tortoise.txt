{{creaturedesc}}
'''Gigantic tortoises''' are the monstrous version of [[giant tortoise]]s.  Along with [[gigantic panda]]s and [[gigantic squid]]s, they receive the "gigantic" title instead of "giant", since there is a normal version of those creatures that is already referred to as "giant".

Due to the fact that tortoises are not only benign, they also react first and foremost by retracting into their shell, if a herd of gigantic tortoises walk onto your map, it is possible to actually build [[cage trap]]s directly underneath a tortoise that is in its shell to capture it without worry.  

With the males half the size of an [[elephant]] at full size (5 years), these creatures provide enough food products to feed a decent-sized fortress for a year. Also, due to the fact that they are born in clutches of 5-10 at a time, a breeding pair and offspring of gigantic tortoises is fully capable of supplying all the food a fortress will ever need.  For moods, they also provide shells.  

While they are benign, they can still be used for your fortress defense; their shells are impressively difficult for enemy troops to penetrate (and nigh unbreakable for unarmed enemies), making them a great distraction that may as well be used to buy time as to give your dwarves a chance to attack unsuspecting [[goblin]]s.
