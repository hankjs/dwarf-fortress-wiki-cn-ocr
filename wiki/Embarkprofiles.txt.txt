:''See [[Starting build]] for detailed information on planning an embark.''
:''See [[Embark profile repository]] for a collection of embark profiles.''

The '''embark_profiles.txt''' file contains any [[embark]] profiles (or [[starting build]]s) you have created. It is found in the <code>prefs/</code> [[Game_folders_and_files|folder]], the location of that depends on the [[Settings#Portable_mode|portable mode]] setting, but the file only exists once you've saved a profile. Most of these can be transferred between minor versions (e.g. v0.34.10 to v0.34.11), but you need to remember to do so.

== Format ==
Each profile begins with a [PROFILE] tag, followed by a [TITLE:''name''] tag.

=== Skills ===
Skills are identified by their [[skill token]]. The syntax for skills is:
 [SKILL:''#'':''skill name'':''level'']
where # is the dwarf (1-7), "skill name" is the skill, and "level" is the number representing how skilled the dwarf is.

Note that skills are capped at Proficient (5), and this is checked by the game on embark, so it's not possible to start with legendary dwarves. There are other ways to do this (see [[Cheating#All Skills Legendary|Cheating]] or [[User:Vjek]] for more information).

=== Items ===
Items are identified by their material and item tokens, the same format as [[reaction]]s:
 [ITEM:''quantity'':''(material token)'':''(item token)'']
For examples, see [[reaction]], [[item token]], [[material token]], or [[Utility:DFHack/createitem|DFHack createitem]].

Be aware that profiles cannot add any items that the player's [[civilization]] does not have access to. If an embark profile specifies an iron anvil, but the host nation has not discovered iron, then the anvil will not get included. This specific issue can be worked around by specifying a more expensive steel anvil (which is always available). For lumber, [[tunnel tube]] wood is also always available and (as of DF v0.44) is the lightest wood that is so.

=== Pets ===
 [PET:''quantity'':''creature name'':''caste'':''age'']
* "Creature" is the creature ID found in the raws (e.g. CAT for [[Cat/raw|cats]]).
* "Caste" is the caste ID, which can also be found in the raws. Most creatures have MALE and FEMALE castes.
* "Age" can be either STANDARD (for adults) or CHILD (for children).

==Obtaining new profiles==
* See [[Embark profile repository]] for a collection of embark profiles.
* The [[Masterwork:Main Page|Masterwork mod]] includes a set of embark profiles as well.
