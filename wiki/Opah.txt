'''Opah''' are a species of [[Creature|fish]] who can be found in [[temperate]] and [[tropical]] [[ocean]]s. Over three times the size of a [[dwarf]], they provide a good amount of returns when [[butcher]]ed. As non-[[vermin]] fish, opah can't be fished by [[Fisherdwarf|fisherdwarves]], but can be caught with the use of a [[drowning chamber]]. Infant opah are called ''opah fry''.

Some dwarves [[Preferences|like]] opah for their ''coloration''.
