'''Cassava''' is an [[aboveground]] [[crop|garden plant]]. They can be planted in all seasons, only the plant is edible when [[cooking|cooked]], and can also be [[brewing|brewed]] into [[alcohol|cassava beer]].

This is to reflect that in real life the raw plant contains poisonous cyanogenic glycosides, which need to be leached out of the plant before consumption.

Some [[Dwarf|dwarves]] [[preferences|like]] cassavas for their ''roots''.
