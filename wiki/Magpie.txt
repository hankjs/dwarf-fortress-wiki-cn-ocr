'''Magpies''' are a type of [[above ground]] [[vermin]], found in a number of [[temperate]] [[biome]]s. They may be captured in [[animal trap]]s and turned into [[pet]]s. All magpies possess Legendary [[skill]] in [[Climber|climbing]].

Some dwarves [[Preferences|like]] magpies for their ''intelligence'' and their ''fondness of shiny objects''.
