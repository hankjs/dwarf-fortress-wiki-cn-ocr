As of v50.01, the '''construction removal''' [[labor]] has been changed into a job within the [[mining]] labor. More specifically, it has been incorporated into the remove ramps/staircases designation.

You can no longer have dwarves responsible only for removing constructions, they now need to have the mining labor enabled.

==Bugs==
A dwarf will (temporarily) cancel the removal of a walkable tile if another creature is standing on the tile. He won't cancel, though, if *he* is the one standing on the tile (as a result of a "creature swap", for instance), making construction removal at least moderately dangerous work.{{bug|8253}}
