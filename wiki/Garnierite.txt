'''Garnierite''' is the only ore of [[nickel]], a low-value [[metal]], that only occurs in [[gabbro]], appearing in the form of [[vein]]s. With [[classic|classic graphics]], it is also the only stone/ore that is bright green, making it uniquely useful for [[Color|color-coded]] [[lever]]s as well as general decorative purposes. Despite being found in magma-safe stone and producing a magma-safe metal, garnierite itself is not magma-safe.
