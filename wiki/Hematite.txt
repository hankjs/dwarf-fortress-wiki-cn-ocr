'''Hematite''' is an [[ore]] of [[iron]], a mid-value [[metal]] useful for [[weapon]]s, [[armor]], and [[steel]] production. Hematite is found as [[vein]]s in [[sedimentary]] and [[igneous extrusive]] [[stone layers|layers]], as well as in small clusters in [[metamorphic]] and [[igneous intrusive]] layers.

Hematite can be [[smelter|smelted]] by a dwarf with the [[furnace operating]] [[labor]] to produce four iron [[bar]]s per ore unit. Raw hematite can also be [[gem cutter|cut]] by a [[jeweler]] to produce cabochons (stone [[gem]]s), however, [[stud]]ding with iron produces 4x as many [[decoration]]s, with higher material [[value]] as well.

It is also the name of the fourth month of the dwarven [[calendar]], and takes place during early Summer.
