[[File:Fractured Metamorphosed Sedimentary Layers.jpg|thumb|320px|right|This is ''easily'' 200 rock doors minimum.]]A '''metamorphic layer''' is a [[stone layer]] comprised of metamorphic rock. Metamorphic layers contain several unique and valuable types of [[gems]]; however, they are generally poor in metal ores, containing small clusters of [[iron]] at most. Furthermore the only metamorphic [[flux]] layer stone is [[marble]]. 

Metamorphic rocks arise from the transformation of existing rock types, in a process called metamorphism, which means "change in form". The original rock is subjected to heat and pressure, causing profound physical or chemical change. The protolith may be a sedimentary, igneous, or existing metamorphic rock.
