'''Angelsharks''' are [[Cartilage|cartilaginous]] [[Creature#Aquatic|fish]] that don't do much of anything except laze about in [[temperate]] and [[tropical]] [[ocean]]s. At half the size of a [[dog]], they pose no threat to [[dwarves]]. As fully-sized creatures, they can't be fished by [[Fisherdwarf|fisherdwarves]], but can be caught with a [[drowning chamber]]. An infant angelshark is called an ''angelshark pup''.

Being cartilaginous, angelsharks won't give [[bone]]s if [[butcher]]ed (though they'll still provide a [[skull]]).

Some dwarves [[Preferences|like]] angelsharks for their ''ability to conceal themselves''.
