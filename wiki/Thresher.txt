'''Thresher''' is the skill that [[dwarves]] use when given the '''plant processing''' [[labor]]. Not all plants can be "processed", only those that have a useful by-product. If a [[stack]] of plants is processed, that's it, it cannot then also be [[cook]]ed, [[brew]]ed or otherwise prepared, however the seeds may be planted or (if appropriate) processed.  

"Processing plants" actually covers 4 separate, different [[job]]s done at a [[farmer's workshop]], depending on the plant being processed:

:* '''Process plants''': turns [[Plant_fiber|fibrous plants]] into the corresponding types of [[thread]] plus their [[seed]]s, or certain unusual plants into their [[Modification:Expanded_Plants/Reactions#Growths|growths]] plus seeds. 

:* '''Process plants (to [[bag]])''': turns [[quarry bush]]es into quarry bush leaves and seeds ([[rock nut]]s).  Five leaves and one rock nut are produced per [[quarry bush]] in the stack.

:* '''Process plants (to [[barrel]])''': turns [[sweet pod]]s into [[dwarven syrup]] and produces sweet pod seeds.  Each sweet pod in the stack produces five units of syrup.

:* '''Process plants (to [[vial]])''': turns [[valley herb]]s into [[golden salve]]. Requires a [[glass]] vial.  Currently, there is no use for this [[extract]] other than as an export good.

Furthermore the "Make Dye" from leafs (and bark) jobs at the [[dyer's shop]] use this skill.
