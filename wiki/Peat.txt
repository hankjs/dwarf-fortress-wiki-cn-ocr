'''Peat''' is one of the many types of [[soil]] that can be found in [[soil layer]]s. Peat layers occasionally contain an [[aquifer]].

== In real life ==

[[wikipedia:Peat|Peat]] can be used as a home-heating fuel (after drying), and some places have power stations either directly fueled by peat, or by distilled [[alcohol]] made from peat. On geological timescales, buried peat eventually turns into [[lignite]]. It's also used to give Scotch whisky its distinctive taste. None of these uses are implemented in ''Dwarf Fortress''.
