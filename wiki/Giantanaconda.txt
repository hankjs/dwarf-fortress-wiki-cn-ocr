'''Giant anacondas''' are the [[giant animal]] variant of the common [[anaconda]], who can be found in [[savage]] [[tropical]] [[wetland]]s. Regular anacondas are a particularly large species of snake, but their giant counterparts take this to an extreme: at 933,000 cm<sup>3</sup> they are one of the [[list of creatures by adult size#end_of_list|largest above-ground creatures]] in the game, almost as large as [[water buffalo]]s and [[giraffe]]s, and 15.55 times the size of a lowly [[dwarf]]: when it comes to snakes, only the even-more-extremely oversized [[giant python]] is larger. While not [[syndrome|venomous]], their bite is strong enough to reliably tear entire limbs off your dwarves, [[armor]] and all. Their {{tt|[LARGE_PREDATOR]}} [[creature token]] makes them aggressive towards any dwarves foolish enough to come close. They should only be approached by multiple seasoned military dwarves in full [[armor|regalia]], or better yet, avoided entirely.

Giant anacondas can be captured in [[cage]] [[trap]]s and [[Animal trainer|trained]] into [[pet]]s, possessing the default giant animal value. They are born adults and as such cannot be permanently tamed. Giant anacondas require 20 years of growth to reach full size, but only live 10-20 years, meaning they rarely reach their most imposing size. Like all giant animals, they are considered exotic [[mount]]s.

Some dwarves [[preference|admire]] giant anacondas for their ''great size''.
