[[Citizenship]] refers to belonging to a specific entity. Being a citizen of a [[civilization]] has many implications, such as adopting that civilization's [[ethic]]s and being hostile to any enemy civilization and other [[name]]d enemies.

==Fortress mode==

=== Types of citizens ===

==== Your dwarves ====

Your starting seven dwarves and subsequent [[Immigration|migrants]] are always considered citizens of your fort, and your fort's parent civilization. If you [[Emigration|expel]] them, they will lose citizenship of your fort, but will retain that of your civ. 

You may also acquire non-dwarven citizens in some special cases, [[Citizenship#Risks_and_benefits_of_non-dwarven_citizens|detailed below]].

==== Visitors ====

After being granted long-term residency, and after about 2 years in your fort, [[visitor]]s may apply for citizenship, and accepting will allow them to have [[labor]]s in your fort. You will also be able to reassign their [[occupation]]s.
Mercenaries will never apply for citizenship, though it is worth noting that a bard or other visitor-turned-citizen will be able to become a [[militia captain]], effectively enabling all-mercenary squads. 

When a [[visitor]] petitions for citizenship, they will meet up with your [[mayor]]. All pending petitions are listed on the Petition screen with the name and reason of the [[visitor]]. You can then accept or deny the request.

Once you accept a visitor as a citizen, they will no longer be able to hold a room in a [[tavern]] as a long-term resident, and you will need to provide a [[zone#Bedroom|room]] in the same way you would for a [[dwarf]]. They will accept labors and can be put to work, the same as any dwarves might be. 

In a [[library]], petitioned citizens will read [[books]] and [[scroll|scrolls]], but cannot make them unless they are [[scholars]].


==== Rescued prisoners ====

If you send [[squad]]s on a rescue/recovery [[mission]] to a foreign site that happens to hold prisoners, your dwarves may free them and bring them back to your fort. These units become citizens of your fort, but their labors can't be changed and are set to whatever [[skill]]s they had. Like visitors, rescued prisoners can be from any race.

==== Tamed sentients ====

You may acquire citizens by [[Animal training#Taming intelligent creatures|training]] sentient creatures that are trainable (i.e. have {{token|PET}} or {{token|PET_EXOTIC}}). Currently, this only concerns [[gremlin]]s. You can also get tamed sentients that could not be tamed in any other way (like goblins) through [[tribute]]s. Pet sentients are subject to all sorts of weird behavior, which eventually disappears when they apply for citizenship after 2 years like visitors. However, they still need to be trained, and your animal trainer may die of thirst trying to follow around your pet (''or 'pet' as the case may be'') as it goes to its various errands, if you aren't careful. Note that any offspring that you train as children will become fully tame, as with any other animal, and won't need training.

=== Risks and benefits of non-dwarven citizens ===

Multiracial forts have a number of benefits, but also carry risk due to the inherent differences between your dwarves and other races. There are some things to watch out for:
*Non-dwarf citizens may want to pray to their own deity, not the dwarven pantheon. They will be able to if you have a temple not dedicated to any specific [[deity]].
*The different [[Value|values]] of other creatures may cause negative [[thought]]s, or even [[grudge]]s, if arguments happen (can occur as part of the socialise task); or if, for example, an [[elf]] is asked to chop down a [[tree]].
*Non-dwarves don't handle alcohol really well; this may result in brawls and various degrees of alcohol poisoning.
*If a visitor happens to be from one of the various [[animal people]] races, some traits carried over from the animal species can be... interesting. Some tags, such as {{token|CURIOUSBEAST_GUZZLER}}, {{token|CURIOUSBEAST_EATER}}, {{token|CURIOUSBEAST_ITEM}}, or {{token|MEANDERER}} may result in [[fun|unexpected]] behaviour.
*Many need different-sized clothing.  Elves can wear the same clothes as dwarves, but humans need larger clothes and goblins need smaller.  You can specify the size of clothing made. Note that armorsmiths, clothes makers, etc. will make gear and clothes appropriate to their own size, regardless of the general racial population make-up of the fortress.

On the other hand:
*Non-dwarves don't suffer from [[cave adaptation]], nor are they [[alcohol]] dependent (except for those hardened by trauma who "don't really care about anything anymore"). You can freely send them outside and they won't drink as much booze (make sure you have a clean water supply set up if you haven't already).
*Some races have intrinsic abilities, e.g. [[gremlin]]s have natural [[ambusher]] skill and will hunt alongside your hunters.
*Some races have a different attribute distribution.  Humans are considered to be average at everything.  In comparison, dwarves are a little stronger and tougher but less agile.  Elves have naturally-high agility, and so they would be good at jobs that require moving around a lot, like Shearing, Herbalism, or Milking.
*Some animal people races may have truly awesome perks, such as special abilities (like web walking) or immunities (to pain, stunning, dizziness, etc.), making them a good choice for your army. The rule of thumb is: if the animal in question has the perk, the citizen probably has it, too.  Unfortunately, having visitors other than dwarves, elves, humans, and goblins is rare.

== In Adventure mode ==

During character creation, you may choose to become a citizen of one of the civilizations you'll start the game in (except if you choose to be an Outsider). As such, you will have access to all the knowledge acquired by that civilization: music/poetry/dance forms, bestiary, location of [[site]]s as well as a portion of the world map, and so on. Choosing one's starting civilization is therefore not a trivial choice.

== With DFHack ==
Through judicious use of [[DFHack]]'s <code>tweak makeown</code> you can turn ''any'' sentient creature into a citizen of your fort. {{catlink|Learns|The possibilities are limitless}}. This may have side effects though, depending on whom you use this on. The base requirements for the creature to be considered a citizen appear to be {{token|CAN_LEARN|c}} + {{token|CAN_SPEAK|c}}. After using the command, the target will start behaving like a long-term resident of your fortress, and will petition for full citizenship after the requisite two years. To otherwise reassign their [[labor]]s, you'd have to use utilities like <code>gui/gm-editor</code> if you didn't want to wait that long.
