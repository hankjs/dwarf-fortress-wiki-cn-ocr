'''Brass''' is an [[metal|alloy]] of [[zinc]] and [[copper]]. Brass can be used to make [[furniture]] and [[metal crafter|other objects]] at a [[metalsmith's forge]].

Brass can be made using one of the following recipes:
*[[Zinc]] bar + [[Copper]] bar = 2 brass bars
*[[Sphalerite]] + [[Native copper]] or [[Malachite]] or [[Tetrahedrite]] = 8 brass bars

Zinc and copper both have a [[material value]] of 2, but brass has a value of 7, making it a very profitable alloy to produce (specifically, a value increase of 250%). Note that brass is not [[magma-safe]].
