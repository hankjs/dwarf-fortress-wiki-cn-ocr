[[File:bin_preview.png|right]]Ordinarily, each item or stack (e.g. ≡Dwarven Ale Stew [12]≡) of items occupies one space of [[stockpile]] room. You can consolidate stockpile space by making [[bin]]s, [[barrel]]s and [[large pot|pots]] that can hold many items at once. Barrels and pots store [[food]] and [[alcohol]]; bins can store many types of smaller items, such as [[finished goods]], [[metal]] [[bar]]s, [[ammo]], and [[gem]]s. Building a steady supply of containers helps reduce the space you need for [[storage]].  If resources permit, it's very easy to keep a nominal amount of bins and/or barrels available by using [[Manager]] work orders.

==Bin & Barrel storage==
Bins and barrels can be assigned to hold items in various stockpiles*. However, to store empty bins or barrels...

* Empty Bins are stored in a Furniture/Bins stockpile.
* Empty Barrels are stored in a Furniture/Barrels stockpile.

It is not necessary to do this, especially if you have fewer bins/barrels than your other stockpiles are demanding.*  

:: ''(* see [[Using bins and barrels#Managing stockpiles directly|managing stockpiles directly]], below)''

Note: It may be an idea to limit Quality and overall Quality, to save your Masterwork and/or Artifact Bins/Barrels for display for dwarves that may have those [[preference]]s.

===Food storage===

Food can be stored in [[barrel]]s and [[large pot|pots]]. Each barrel or large pot can hold up to 60 total units. Each unit in a stack counts towards the total storage.

Foods will only be stored together if they're from the same category.  For example, dwarves will never mix plants and meat in the same barrel.

One thing to note about storing [[seed]]s is that [[bag]]s are required to put seeds in. These bags will then be placed inside the barrel or pot. Otherwise, the dwarves will end up with one seed per tile. Furthermore, as seeds will rot outside of a stockpile, you may find that your fortress is not getting seeds from the plants you're consuming when the food stockpile is full. Get your textile industry started early; you may want to avoid milling plants until it ramps up. [http://www.bay12forums.com/smf/index.php?topic=79168.msg2055095#msg2055095]

===Drink storage===

[[Alcohol]] must be [[brewer|brewed]] into either a barrel or pot. Each container can hold a single stack of alcohol. Larger batches should be, but aren't, split across multiple containers automatically. 

You can empty a container of alcohol by drinking, cooking, shotgunning it out of a minecart, trading, or application of extreme cold that destroys the container.

===Goods storage===

Most non-food items can be stored in [[bin]]s; the quantity allowed depends upon the items stored. Each bin can store up to 12 [[bar]]s or [[block]]s, while 30 or more small [[craft]]s may fit into a single bin.

==Managing stockpiles directly==

It is possible to set whether bins and barrels can be used in a non-Furniture stockpile by opening that stockpile's menu ({{Menu icon|p}} and clicking on the pile, or when creating it) and then clicking on the barrel icon within the menu. Some stockpiles will have a default to use either bins or barrels:
* bins are used for Bar/[[Block]], ammo, gems, finished goods, [[cloth]] and [[leather]] stockpiles
* barrels are used for food stockpiles (of all types)
Also by default, the stockpiles that specifically use barrels or bins to store other items will permit the <u>maximum number</u> of bins and/or barrels to match the total size of the stockpile. You can override this by specifying the maximum number of barrels and bins that an individual stockpile is allowed to utilize by clicking the plus and minus buttons or by clicking the pound sign and typing the desired number.

* Take care when changing a stockpile's size or allowed contents, as this can reset the allowed numbers of barrels and bins.

Once a bin or barrel has been placed in an assigned food or item stockpile, it is available to be filled with appropriate items according to that stockpile's definition.  Note that, if you designate a stockpile to have a certain number of bins and/or barrels, those will be placed there even if that stockpile has no items which can be placed into a bin and/or a barrel.

==Bin/Barrel reassignment==

If you have a limited number of barrels and pots (possibly due to a lumber and stone shortage because you're playing in a [[Fun]] place like the tundra) and your food stockpile is using too many barrels and you need some for booze, or if for some reason the opposite is true, you can force the dwarves through a series of steps to have the barrels switch from one stockpile to another.  Assume you have too much barrelled food and you need barrels for booze.  First, designate a small [[Activity_zone#Garbage_Dump|garbage dump]] zone nearby.  Then set the maximum barrel limit on the food stockpile way down--possibly to zero.  Don't worry, the existing barrels won't be dumped as a result.  Now you can dump items in the barrels individually, by clicking on the barrel and clicking the dump icon on each item within... or, you can dump en masse with [[designations]]: {{Menu icon|i|p}} and click on each barrel. When dumping en masse, you can leave designations with {{key|esc}} or {{key|right click}} and click into each barrel afterwards to remove dumping on the barrel itself. 

Once the contents are marked for dumping, the dwarves will take the food from the barrel and throw it into the garbage zone, and once the barrel is empty they will immediately move it to a furniture stockpile because the food stockpile barrel limit is exceeded already.  Now you have a free barrel with which to [[brewing|brew]].  You can reclaim the food from the garbage dump now, and the dwarves will do what they can to store it.  Be warned that this might end up being on the floor in the stockpile which could attract flies.  Remember to set the barrel limit on the food stockpile back up to some reasonable level if you get your hands on some new barrels.

This trick does not work on [[artifact]]s as these cannot be dumped. One way to remove artifacts from a bin is to select them for display on a [[pedestal]].

==Barrel and bin material==
Heavy barrels and bins slow down hauling, so it is wise to make them from light materials when possible. Even the heaviest types of [[wood]] are lighter than any metal (excluding [[adamantine]]) - the wood of [[feather tree]]s is the best of all. As an alternative, you can place small "feeder" [[stockpile]]s that disallow barrels/bins and link them to larger storage stockpiles nearby to greatly reduce the distance traveled while carrying a heavy container.

[[Metal]] barrels are supposedly better for food stockpiles because they resist [[vermin]]; unfortunately there is no good way to convince your dwarves to allocate metal barrels for food storage aside from using them exclusively.

The material of the container also determines whether the container is [[fire-safe]] and [[magma-safe]].

== Bugs ==

* Hauling jobs block access to all the items in the destination containers until the hauling is complete. This often results in cancellation spam and work delays.{{bug|9004}} One workaround is creating a "feeder stockpile" with containers disabled. [https://dwarffortressbugtracker.com/view.php?id=9004#c42743 This may have been fixed].

* Items in bins are sometimes not found for tasks.{{bug|8755}}
