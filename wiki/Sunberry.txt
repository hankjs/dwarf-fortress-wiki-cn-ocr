'''Sun berries''' are an [[above ground|aboveground]] [[plant]] found naturally growing only in [[good]] areas, and only next to natural water sources. They are most numerous upon an embark start in good [[wetland]]s of any salinity. Sun berries have a high value and can be [[brewing|brewed]] into sunshine, the highest-[[value]] [[alcohol]] in ''Dwarf Fortress''. While high value does not increase the chance of a [[dwarf]] having a happy [[thought]], it may increase the effect of such a thought. [[Caravan]]s that travel to your fortress from good areas may bring stacks of sun berries or bags of seeds for trade; this can allow you to set up a sun berry [[Farming|farm]] anywhere outdoor crops will grow, as long as you are in an adequate biome. Note that despite being described as a "berry," sun berries are considered plants and not fruits, and must be brewed from the "Brew Drink from Plant" task, rather than "Brew Drink from Fruit."

Some dwarves [[preference|like]] sun berries for their ''inner light''.
