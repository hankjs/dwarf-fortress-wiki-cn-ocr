'''Lice''' are a species of unremarkable [[above ground]] [[vermin]] who may be found in any non-freezing [[biome]]. They may not be caught in [[animal trap]]s. A comment on their raw files states they should not survive without a host, implying [[Main:Toady One|Toady One]] plans them to be parasitic in a future update. All lice possess Legendary [[skill]] in [[Climber|climbing]].

Some dwarves [[Preferences|like]] lice for their ''ability to infest''.
