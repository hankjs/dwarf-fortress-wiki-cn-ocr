'''Glob''' is a broad classification in the [[stocks]] menu, used for a variety of amorphous solids. [[quarry bush|Rock nut paste]], [[fat]], [[tallow]] (processed fat), [[slurry]], usable [[wax]], and [[magma]] are all types of glob.

==Fatty== 

Most fleshy [[creature]]s have [[Tissue definition token|layers]] of [[fat]] to store energy in. When [[butcher]]ed, the creature will yield a number of globs of fat based on its body size and proportions.

A [[cook]] can render fat into useable [[tallow]] at a [[kitchen]]. Tallow can then be used to make [[soap]] or as another ingredient in [[prepared meal]]s.

Tallow and fat, along with [[wax]], are stored together in food [[stockpile]]s under the "Fat" category.

==Paste==
[[Plant]]-based paste and [[slurry]] is milled at the requisite workstation, either at a [[quern]] or a [[power]]ed [[millstone]]. These materials are intermediaries for later tasks at the [[screw press]].

A [[miller]] can grind [[Quarry bush|rock nuts]] and a small variety of other [[:Category:Pressable|oil-bearing]] [[seed]]s using the "mill seeds/nuts to paste" job, with seed paste needing to have [[oil]] pressed from it to serve as a [[soap]] component.

Most [[thread]]-bearing plants (not counting [[papyrus sedge]]) must be processed into [[slurry]] at a mill before they can be [[Screw press|pressed]] into [[paper]] . The "mash plants into slurry" job is performed by a [[papermaker]].

Slurry and paste are stored in food [[stockpile]]s under the "Paste" category.

==Pressed== 
A [[presser]] working at a [[screw press]] generates [[press cake]]s as a byproduct of pressing plants and seed paste into [[oil]]. Press cakes and pomaces are unremarkable ingredients, only used as filler for a [[prepared meal]].

A presser can also press a [[honeycomb]] to receive [[wax]] and [[honey]], producing a raw material for [[wax worker]]s to make into [[finished goods]].

Press cakes and pomaces are stored in food [[stockpile]]s under the "Pressed Material" category.

==Other Globs== 
Liquid items that [[Temperature|freeze]] or re-solidify will become a glob. 

Creature [[interaction]]s, such as that of the [[magma crab]]'s molten [[basalt]] spit, can launch globs of material.

If a glob is {{token|EDIBLE_RAW|md}}, then it can be [[Food|eaten]] in [[Adventure mode]]. This property is used by certain [[mythical substance]]s, but can also apply to paste and [[press cake]]s.
