'''Spotted wobbegongs''' are a species of [[Cartilage|cartilaginous]] [[Creature|fish]] who can be found in [[temperate]] and [[tropical]] [[ocean]]s. A little heavier than the average [[dwarf]], they provide a fair amount of returns when [[butcher]]ed. As non-[[vermin]] fish, spotted wobbegongs can't be fished by [[Fisherdwarf|fisherdwarves]], but can be caught with the use of a [[drowning chamber]]. Infant spotted wobbegongs are called ''spotted wobbegong pups''.

Being cartilaginous, spotted wobbegongs won't provide [[bone]]s when butchered (but will provide a [[skull]]).

Some dwarves [[Preferences|like]] spotted wobbegongs for their ''coloration''.
