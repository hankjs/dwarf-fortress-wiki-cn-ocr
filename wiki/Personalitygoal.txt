[[File:personality_v50_preview.png|thumb|262px|right|Randomly generated personality of a [[miner]].]]

Some creatures dream of accomplishing certain '''goals''' in their life, and these goals can, presumably, affect their behavior. If a creature has such goals, they will be listed in the "Values" sub-tab of the "Personality" tab of their character sheet. Dwarves will receive a happy thought upon completion of their goals, receiving the notation of "and this dream was realized" in the personality description following their original goals. Goals would apparently ''not'' currently be limited to one per creature, but for some sort of oversight: [http://www.bay12forums.com/smf/index.php?topic=169696.msg8083871#msg8083871]. A creature needs the ability to [[Learning|learn]] in order to have a goal in life.
