The '''magma sea''' is a large, multi-level "sea" of [[magma]] that spans the entire world. These can typically be found by around Z level -120 (though this seems to vary widely (minimum -5, maximum -450 z level){{verify}}. The magma sea is always found below the last [[cavern]] level. 

It is not uncommon to find multiple z-levels of pillars of [[raw adamantine]] in the magma sea (in fact, a 3×3 embark square guarantees at least one).

In addition, around and under the magma sea is [[semi-molten rock]], which is impassable. There are [[Hidden_Fun_Stuff|a few]] [[Underworld spire|exceptions]], however. 

Any items or natural rock walls dropped into the magma sea (specifically, onto "magma flow" tiles above semi-molten rock) will vanish without a trace.

Stockpiles may not be placed on a magma flow tile. However, the magma flow tile can be "destroyed" by creating a construction on top of it and removing the construction.
