Outside of standard [[armor]], [[clothing]] and [[weapon]]s, there are only five other equippable or otherwise usable items in ''Dwarf Fortress''.

* [[Pick]]s allow your dwarves to [[mining|mine]].
* [[Battle axe]]s allow your dwarves to [[wood cutting|chop down trees]].
* [[Backpack]]s allow your dwarves to carry rations.
* [[Flask]]s allow your dwarves to carry water and alcohol.  (Leather flasks are called [[waterskin]]s, glass ones are called [[vial]]s.)
* [[Quiver]]s allow your dwarves to carry [[ammunition]].

==Picks==
[[File:pickaxe_sprite.png|right]]A [[pick]] is a native [[weapon]] that can be [[Metalsmith's forge|forged]] from most (not [[silver]], for example) weapon-grade metals like copper and iron. Picks are required by [[miner]]s to strike the earth, carve staircases and everything else related to the removal of rock and soil tiles, with the exception of rock [[Engraver|smoothing and engraving]]. You will need to supply picks on embark as miners won't bring their own. Speed at digging through rock depends on the user's [[Mining]] skill level, and as of 53.08, the material of the pick (for both dwarves and invaders).

==Battle axes==
[[File:battle_axe_sprite.png|right]]A [[battle axe]] is a native [[weapon]] that can be [[Metalsmith's forge|forged]] from weapon-grade metals like copper and iron.  Battle axes are required by [[wood cutter]]s to fell trees. You will need to supply battle axes on embark as wood cutters won't bring their own. The material used when making a battle axe doesn't have any effect on its wood-cutting performance, with the exception of wooden training axes, which can no longer be used to cut down trees.

==Backpacks==
[[File:backpack_sprite.png|right]]In [[fortress mode]], [[soldier]]s who are ordered to carry food (from the military menu) will equip a backpack to carry the rations in it, which saves them from going to a [[food]] [[stockpile]] whenever they are hungry. This does not mean that they will eat or drink while on duty, it only means that they will save time on their breaks. To prevent extreme hunger and thirst while dwarves are on an active schedule, you must lower the amount of soldiers required for a scheduled task, so that they can be free to eat and drink.

Note that inactive squads will still carry food in their backpacks, and will eat it as civilians when hungry. You may wish to disable this, as while eating their rations saves on travel time, the dwarf will not receive any happy [[thoughts]] about their dining area.

Backpacks can be sewn from leather at the [[leather works]] or [[adamantine]] cloth at a forge.

In [[adventurer mode]], a backpack is required if you want to carry more than you can hold in your hands or strap to your back. Any items taken from the ground with {{adv menu icon|g}} will be automatically placed in the first empty grasp (usually a hand), or if those are all full, then the first backpack worn (unless a quiver is worn, which receives any [[ammo]]) even if it is full.{{bug|2562}} However, putting items into a backpack with {{adv menu icon|p}} will respect the [[storage|capacity]] of backpacks or any other container. A backpack can also be filled with a nearby liquid with {{adv menu icon|i}}, holding up to 50 units{{verify|should be true if drink/liquid is 600 and backpack cap is 30000}}; dropping a liquid from any container with {{adv menu icon|d}} will also drop every thing else in that container.

==Flasks==
{{main|Flask}}
[[File:flasks_sprites.png|right]]In [[fortress mode]], [[soldier]]s who are ordered to carry a drink (from the military menu) will equip a [[flask]] (or waterskin or vial) to carry the drink in. Due to a bug, dwarves will occasionally choose vials which contain extracts to use as a flask; somehow combining [[dwarven wine]] with [[giant desert scorpion]] venom is completely safe.{{bug|3116}}

In [[adventurer mode]], a flask can be used to carry up to 3 units of liquid, using {{adv menu icon|i}} to fill them from nearby liquids; other small items can put into them with {{adv menu icon|p}}; dropping a liquid from any container with {{adv menu icon|d}} will also drop every thing else in that container. They can also be worn under clothing or armor with {{adv menu icon|w}}, but this does not keep them from freezing.

==Quivers==
[[File:quiver_sprite.png|right]]A quiver is an item used to store [[bolt]]s or [[arrow]]s. It is worn on the body, like a backpack. 

Dwarves require a quiver to hold their [[ammo]] whenever engaging in any kind of shooting.  Therefore, you'll need at least one quiver for each [[hunter]] and each marksdwarf in your military.

Quivers are made of leather at a [[leather works]] or [[adamantine]] cloth at a forge.  Invaders, merchants, and migrants often have silk and cloth quivers. They are stored in finished goods stockpiles.

In adventurer mode, arrows and bolts picked up from the ground will automatically be placed in a free grasp, or if no grasp is empty, in the first quiver worn, even if the quiver is full. If filled with the put {{adv menu icon|p}} command, it can hold up to a volume of 12,000 cm³. For example: a quiver can hold 80 various bolts and arrows, but fewer larger items. A quiver can also be filled with a nearby liquid with {{adv menu icon|i}}, holding up to 20 units; dropping a liquid from any container with {{adv menu icon|d}} will also drop every thing else in that container.
