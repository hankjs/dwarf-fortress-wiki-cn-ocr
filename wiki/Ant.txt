'''Ants''' are a type of unremarkable [[above ground]] [[vermin]] found in large numbers in any area that isn't freezing. The color of their wild colonies reflects the material underneath it. Their anthills ([[File:ant_hill_sprite.png]]) can be seen in random locations on the surface.

Some [[dwarves]] [[Preferences|like]] ants for their ''propensity to dig''.
