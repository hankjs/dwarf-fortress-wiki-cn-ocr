The '''Larch''' is a type of [[above ground]] [[tree]], found in [[temperate]] [[forest]]s and occasionally in [[taiga]] regions. Like the overwhelming majority of overland trees, larch [[wood]] is brown and produces brown products. Logs can be processed in a [[dyer's shop]] into golden yellow [[dye]].

Some [[Dwarf|dwarves]] [[Preferences|like]] larches for their ''cones'' and their ''needles''.

{{D for Dwarf}}
With proper instruction, the larch can be recognised from quite a long way away.
