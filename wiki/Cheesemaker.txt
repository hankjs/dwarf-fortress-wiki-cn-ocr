'''Cheese maker''' is the skill associated with the '''cheese making''' [[labor]]. Cheese makers turn [[milk]] into [[cheese]] at the [[farmer's workshop]].

Legendary Cheese makers are known to players for their versatility. They are capable of skillfully baiting [[Trap design|traps]], exploring [[fun]]-filled [[caverns]], digging open [[Magma pool|magma pipes]], <s>meatshielding</s> bravely defending forts from the [[goblin]] horde, and even making cheese. Humans even divined a positive correlation between possessing an enormous amount of cheese and enormous amount of friends, which is further proven by the fact that cheesemakers spend most of their days socializing. Blessed are the cheesemakers.
