'''Unknown frozen creature substance''' is a placeholder [[creature]] [[material]]. It can occasionally appear in-game as a result of [[bug]]s (''or a particular [[Duplicated raws|deliberately induced bug]], per se''). It is a light gray solid that is not affected by [[temperature]], similarly to other undefined materials.
