'''Calcite''' is a [[flux]] stone; however, it's not particularly special, as it is found solely within [[limestone]] and [[marble]], both of which are ''also'' flux. Its only distinguishing characteristic is that it is a [[magma-safe]] rock.

==In real life==

Calcite is a crystalline form of calcium carbonate (CaCO<sub>3</sub>). Calcite is extremely common, forming multiple types of rocks, such as [[limestone]], [[marble]], and [[chalk]], it is also known to form as a concrete in some [[sandstone]]s and [[siltstone]]s. Calcite, along with other crystalline forms of calcium carbonate such as Aragonite (which is not present in ''Dwarf Fortress'') is readily edible (although not easily chewed, and not very palatable), and can be used as a supplementary source of calcium in an otherwise calcium-poor diet.
