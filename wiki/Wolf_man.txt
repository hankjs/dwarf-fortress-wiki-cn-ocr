: ''This page is about wolf people, not to be confused with a werewolf; a type of [[werebeast]].''
{{creaturedesc}}
'''Wolf men''' are humanoid versions of the common [[wolf]] and a [[Creature|species]] of unremarkable [[animal people]], found in a variety of [[savage]] [[biome]]s. They are about as heavy as a [[dwarf]], being only slightly smaller, and should pose no real threat to a civilian unless provoked. They are particularly rare to encounter compared to most animal men.

Like other savage animal people, wolf men may occasionally join [[civilization]]s, becoming full-fledged citizens who may appear in your fortress as [[visitor]]s or be playable in [[adventurer mode]].

[[Clothing]] sized for wolf men can still be worn by dwarves, although it's slightly smaller and, therefore, [[weight|lighter]].  As such, metal [[armor]] forged for wolf men will encumber your dwarves about 8% less, the downside being slightly reduced protection against slashing [[weapon]]s.

Some dwarves [[Preferences|like]] wolf men for their ''cunning''.

<!-- "The Wolf Man" franchise of horror films -->
There is currently no clear link between the Wolf Men known to appear in ''Dwarf Fortress'' and the Wolf Men known to appear in extremely badly-made B movies, although they stand roughly equal chance of becoming involved in hideous, gory horror shows. 

<!-- Reference: "The Boy Who Cried Wolf" fable of Aesop -->
