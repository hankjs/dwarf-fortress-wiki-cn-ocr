==Usage==

No known [[Sphere|spheres]] have any links to this symbol, and default [[Entity|entities]] don't reference this symbol. This symbol might become more relevant with a deeper implementation of [[magic]].

Like all symbols, this can still be used by mods to add flavor to [[Entity token|custom entities]].
