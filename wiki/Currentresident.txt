When an [[animal]], like a [[dragon]] or [[alligator]], kills a humanoid during worldgen, it is named (same as during [[fortress mode]]). As a result, it will move into a [[cave]] and can be found by a player who embarks on said cave, or travels there in [[adventurer mode]]. Instead of "'''Wild Animal'''" they will be designated "'''current resident'''". The same happens during adventure mode when you or your <s>meatshields</s> fellow adventurers are killed by a creature. They are not affected by [[trap]]s and they are stronger than regular animals of their kind.{{Verify}}

Other creatures like [[troll]]s or [[giant rat]]s that may actually dwell in the cave too will be listed as a wild animal, unless they are named.
<!--Verify: If I remember correctly, named creatures have a taste for blood and cannot be tamed.--~~~~-->
