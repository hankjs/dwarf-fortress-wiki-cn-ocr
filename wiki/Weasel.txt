'''Weasels''' are small [[creature]]s who can be found in every biome except [[mountain]]s and [[glacier]]s. They are solitary and may not be found during the winter. They're benign and one of the smallest animals in the game who aren't outright [[vermin]], making them entirely harmless. A newborn weasel is called a ''weasel kit''.

Weasels may be captured in [[cage]] [[trap]]s and [[Animal trainer|trained]] into exotic [[pet]]s of low value. Their tiny size means they can't be [[butcher]]ed if hunted, and slaughtered tame ones will only give a [[skull]] in return. Weasels are also very short-lived, living no more than 3 years.

Some [[Dwarf|dwarves]] [[Preferences|like]] weasels for their ''long bodies'' and their ''short legs''.
==Trivia==
*Weasels share the same sprites as [[stoat]]s.
