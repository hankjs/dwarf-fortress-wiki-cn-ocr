'''Native copper''' is one of the several [[ore]]s of [[copper]], the most versatile [[metal]] in ''Dwarf Fortress'', primarily useful in creating [[alloy]]s. Native copper is found in the form of [[vein]]s. Mined-out hunks of native copper are called ''copper nuggets''. Other copper-bearing ores include [[malachite]] and [[tetrahedrite]].

== In Real Life ==
Native copper is not strictly an ore, but chunks of copper in its naturally formed (native) metallic state.  As copper is fairly unreactive as metals go, this is much more common than native aluminum. It was an important source of copper for many prehistoric cultures.
