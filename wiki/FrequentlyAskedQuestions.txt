==Gameplay: Uncategorized==

'''Water Questions'''

Q: ''If you drain water into naturally flooded caverns, will it flow off the map? Or will they eventually start to fill up?''

A: It will flow off the edge of the map.

'''Bones'''

Q: ''I've got someone in a mood and he wants bones. Well, there's a dead bear skeleton just outside the fort, and I've got lots of tame animals tethered or wandering around.''

A: First off, make sure you've got a butcher's shop, and a dwarf with butchering labor enabled.
Then go to the "animals screen"(from {z} screen), and toggle "ready for slaughter" for those you want to kill.
Your butcher will also automatically butcher every dead animal in the refuse stockpile. This includes extracting bones from "partial skeletons". Make a refuse stockpile by the butcher's, and enable refuse gathering from the outside(o->r->o, iirc).

'''Mining'''

Q: ''I have 3 miners in my fort, 1 is a migrant (He's the working miner) the other 2 came on embark. The original 2 won't mine anything. (I checked and they're holding picks) The new guy is steady mining all the time. What gives?''

A: If you're mining a tunnel which is only 1 square in width, only 1 dwarf will mine. Ensure they all have picks equipped. 
Did you perchance assign mining through Dwarf Therapist?
Either way, unassign, unpause, and then reassign mining labor. Could be all that's required.
In some of my own tests, it wasn't even necessary to unpause - just going into v-p-l, selecting Mining (or Wood Cutting) and hitting Enter twice was enough to fix it.

'''Immigrants'''

Q: ''Is there any way to edit the frequency or max/min amount of migrants that join your fortress? I keep keeping double digit migrations and I hate being forced to expand quickly. I know I can just draft some into military positions, but I have a picky principle on better to not have labor than to waste labor.''

A: See [[Immigration]]

'''Groups'''

Q: ''I've recently noticed while browsing Legends that some of my dwarves started a group, "The Noiseless Thing". It doesn't say it worships anything/anyone, but dwarves entered it ''en masse'' (though I don't think all of them). Should I be worried? I also have not found anything when searching for "group" on the subject on this wiki.

'''Saving'''

Q: ''Is there autosaving?''

A: Autosave frequency can be configured in [[Settings#Autosaves|settings]]; this does not happen in adventure mode, and the number of autosaves cannot be configured.

'''Sound'''

Q: Every time I start the game the sound is at 255/255. Is there any way to make it start at a different level?

A: In your init file, you can turn sound off by default with [SOUND:NO] or set the sound to a specific volume with [VOLUME:100] or whatever level you want. The init file can be found in the ''Dwarf Fortress'' folder under data/init/init.txt

==Using DF Wiki (Editing policies)==
While browsing the wiki, users are encouraged to contribute by adding information, correcting mistakes, improving links between articles, and researching unconfirmed or incomplete facts.  If you're new to the game, you are even more likely to encounter errors, be confused by inconsistencies or phrasing, or have unanswered questions that should be answered here.  While you gather your answers — from the [[::Forums|forums]], on [[::IRC|IRC]], through playing and testing, or by other means — and figure things out, you're in a unique position to improve the information here for the next person.

A good wiki is not just about quality information, but also quality presentation and accessibility.  There are many editing customs which contribute to quality and consistency of the wiki.  Please take a few minutes to read the [[DF:Community_Portal|Rules]].  You can also look through the [[DF_talk:Manual_of_Style|Style Manual]] and some of the other discussions on the [[DF:Centralized_Discussion|centralized discussion page]] found through navigation panel on the left.  For technical help with editing features, such as linking and formatting, click the [[Help:Contents|Help link]], also on the left navigation panel.

Facts should be verified to be complete and accurate, preferably in game, before adding to the wiki.  When in doubt, but you think it's useful information, just add it and someone will fix it later.  If an item of information is not verified, it should be [[:Category:Verify|labeled for verification]].

Each topic has a Talk page where you can ask questions, discuss your ideas and reasoning with others until the facts are worked out, or say anything that doesn't belong in the actual topic page.  Remember this is not a forum, so don't expect replies or even to be noticed if you didn't use a verify label in the topic page.  Always [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Signatures sign] your talk page comments with <nowiki>~~~~</nowiki>, and read the [[Wikipedia:Talk_page_guidelines|talk page guidelines]].  Note that not all topics have an existing Talk page.  Clicking a verify link or the Discussion tab on the topic's main page will create one (see Starting a New Page below).

Starting a New Page: There are various ways to [http://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/Help:Starting_a_new_page start a new page].  However, only the "Autoconfirmed" [[Special:ListGroupRights|user group]] may do so.  You will be automatically added to this group once you have contributed a reasonable number of edits (currently 3). Until then, you may request the creation of new pages on [[DF:Page request|this request page]].

==Writing answers policy==
If you know of a page on the wiki that answers a question already, '''don't''' just redirect to it. Edit the FAQ and change the link to point to it directly.

Whether you link to a page, or create a new page to answer the question, '''don't forget''' to add the template code! That would be: <nowiki>{{Name of FAQ}}</nowiki>
