'''Coyotes''' are small and rare canine [[Creature|animals]] found in packs of 2-10 in most [[biome]]s, except tropical and freezing ones. Half the size of a [[dog]] or [[wolf]], coyotes aren't aggressive and will generally avoid [[Dwarf|dwarves]] despite being carnivorous, preferring to simply meander around the area aimlessly. A juvenile coyote is called a ''pup''.

Coyotes can be captured in [[cage]] [[trap]]s and [[Animal trainer|trained]] into exotic [[pet]]s. They aren't trainable for war or hunting and give roughly less returns than dogs when [[butcher]]ed, but their parts are worth [[Multiply value|twice]] more than those of common animals. Due to their low frequency rate, however, they make poor choices for livestock, as you may not even encounter them at all.

Some dwarves [[Preferences|like]] coyotes for their ''howling''.

{{D for Dwarf}}
Coyotes are well known for eating only very fast birds, and they will frequently try and lay slightly overblown [[trap]]s to catch them, only for the trap to fail spectacularly and nail the coyote instead, not unlike what happens with some dwarven settlements. As a result, some dwarves tend to see the coyote as kin, a brotherhood of bad luck, if you will.
