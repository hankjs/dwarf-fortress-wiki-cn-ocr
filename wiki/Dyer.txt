'''Dyer''' is the skill associated with the '''dyeing''' [[labor]]. Dyers use a [[dyer's shop]] to [[dye]] either [[thread]] or [[cloth]].  Finished cloth goods may not be dyed.

Dyeing adds the [[value]] of the dye, multiplied with the [[quality]] of the dye job to the thread or cloth. Depending on the dye used and the quality of the dyeing, this can give a nice value boost.
