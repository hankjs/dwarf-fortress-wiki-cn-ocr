'''Moon snail men''' are [[animal people]] variants of the common [[moon snail]], who can inhabit [[savage]] [[temperate]] [[ocean]]s. They spawn in groups of 1-3 individuals and are generally content to keep to themselves, and may not encounter your fortress at all due to being purely aquatic. In terms of size, they are a little over half the weight of the average [[dwarf]].

Like other non-amphibious, aquatic animal people, moon snail men cannot currently join civilizations or appear as visitors and they are not playable in adventurer mode.

Some dwarves [[Preferences|like]] moon snail men for their ''predatory nature'' and their ''striking coloration''.
