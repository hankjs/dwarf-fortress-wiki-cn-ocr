[[File:attributes_v50_preview.png|thumb|262px|right|Attributes of a stoneworker.]]A creature has numerous '''attributes''' which affect its performance at various tasks, split into physical factors associated with the body, and mental factors associated with the [[soul]].

Body Attributes can be viewed in the creature's Health -> Description screen. Soul Attributes can be viewed in the creature's Personality -> Traits screen. Positive attributes are shown in green, negative attributes are shown in red, and average attributes are omitted. Said attributes may be listed as follows (may have to be highlighted to be seen):<br />
{{DFtext|He is slow to tire and agile, |2:0}}{{DFtext|but he is quite susceptible to disease.|4:0}}

On the Overview screen, a dwarf's top six most varied attributes and [[personality_trait|personality traits]] are summarized in order of how much they differ from the average dwarf. The adjectives used are more generalized than those used in the Traits screen and are limited to two per trait (Creative and Not creative, Strong and Weak, etc.). For example, "a boundless creative imagination" is merely listed as "Creative", while "unfathomably weak" is just listed as "Weak". Since some of the adjectives used in the Overview summary overlap with some used in the Traits screen, this can be somewhat misleading. However, average and one tier above/below average traits will never be listed in the Overview screen, so only a "very weak" or below dwarf will be listed as "Weak" in the overview.

Attributes are associated with skills, so that shield use will raise endurance as an attribute, but not attributes like memory. Different attributes raised by one skill may not be raised by the same amount. Attribute and skill gain and rust rates are moddable in the raws as a [[creature token]].

== Descriptions ==
In-game attribute descriptions are calculated based on the difference from the [[creature|species]] average<!-- caste average? -->. [[Human]]s' median attribute values are always 1000 - thus, if the median [[dwarf]] has higher than 1000 for an attribute, that means the median dwarf is better than the median human for that attribute (however, individual humans may be better than individual dwarves, due to intraspecies variation). Likewise, if the median dwarf has below 1000 for an attribute, then the median human bests the median dwarf in that contest.

The tiers at which descriptions change are 250, 500, 750, and 1000 above or below the species median. Interestingly, if a species has an attribute with a median below 1000, such as dwarves' agility, the lowest tier will never be displayed.

These descriptions are not used in [[adventurer mode]].

== Body attributes ==
The attribute values given in the tables correspond to default racial averages for dwarves only. Modded dwarves or any other creature will report the same phrases, but the underlying numbers may be very different, as they are calculated based on the species average. In almost every case, a higher attribute value is better, as opposed to [[personality trait]]s where one may prefer higher or lower depending on the situation.

=== Strength ===
Alters the damage done in melee (increases velocity of weapon swings), increases muscle mass (a thicker muscle layer also resists damage more, and larger size makes one stronger in general), and increases how much a creature can carry. Higher strength also increases the speed of fast [[gait]]s in most creatures, including running, soaring, galloping, and fast swimming, however, proportionate gains in muscle mass can eventually reduce speed enough to overtake the gains (more so with larger creatures than dwarves). The dwarven median of 1250 is higher than average.

{| class=wikitable style="width:400px;"
! Value
! Description|-| 2250&ndash;5000 || unbelievably strong|-| 2000&ndash;2249 || mighty|-| 1750&ndash;1999 || very strong|-| 1500&ndash;1749 || strong|-| 1001&ndash;1499 || (no description)|-| 751&ndash;1000  || weak|-| 501&ndash;750   || very weak|-| 251&ndash;500   || unquestionably weak|-| 0&ndash;250 || unfathomably weak|}

===Agility===
This attribute affects the speed of a creature's fast-moving [[gait]]s in the same way as strength &mdash; a creature with maximum agility and strength can run faster than a creature with minimum agility and strength. The median dwarf agility of 900 is slightly below average.

Because dwarves in general have below-average agility, and because the descriptions are based on the difference from the racial average, no dwarves will ever display as "abysmally clumsy".

{| class=wikitable style="width:400px;"
! Value

Description|-| 1900&ndash;5000 || amazingly agile|-| 1650&ndash;1899 || extremely agile|-| 1400&ndash;1649 || very agile|-| 1150&ndash;1399 || agile|-| 651&ndash;1149  || (no description)|-| 401&ndash;650   || clumsy|-| 151&ndash;400   || quite clumsy|-| 0&ndash;150     || totally clumsy|-| (never displayed) || abysmally clumsy|}

===Toughness===
Increases time required to suffocate. The dwarf median of 1250 is higher than average.

{| class=wikitable style="width:400px;"
! Value
! Description|-| 2250&ndash;5000 || basically unbreakable|-| 2000&ndash;2249 || incredibly tough|-| 1750&ndash;1999 || quite durable|-| 1500&ndash;1749 || tough|-| 1001&ndash;1499 || (no description)|-| 751&ndash;1000 || flimsy|-| 501&ndash;750 || very flimsy|-| 251&ndash;500 || remarkably flimsy|-| 0&ndash;250 || shockingly fragile|}

===Endurance===
Reduces the rate at which creatures become exhausted, increases the rate of tiredness recovery, increases time required to suffocate, and, if both this and WILLPOWER are effectively above 1750, prevents falling over from exhaustion. The dwarven median endurance of 1000 is exactly the human average.

{| class=wikitable style="width:400px;"
! Value

Description|- | 2000&ndash;5000 || absolutely inexhaustible|-| 1750&ndash;1999 || indefatigable|-| 1500&ndash;1749 || very slow to tire|-| 1250&ndash;1499 || slow to tire|-| 751&ndash;1249 || (no description)|-| 501&ndash;750 || quick to tire|-| 251&ndash;500 || very quick to tire|-| 1&ndash;250 || extremely quick to tire|-| 0 || truly quick to tire|}

===Recuperation===
Increases the rate of wound healing and the speed at which fat is lost. The dwarven median recuperation of 1000 is exactly the human average.

{| class=wikitable style="width:400px;"
! Value
! Description|-| 2000&ndash;5000 || possessed of amazing recuperative powers|-| 1750&ndash;1999 || incredibly quick to heal|-| 1500&ndash;1749 || quite quick to heal|-| 1250&ndash;1499 || quick to heal|-| 751&ndash;1249  || (no description)|-| 501&ndash;750   || slow to heal|-| 251&ndash;500   || very slow to heal|-| 1&ndash;250 || really slow to heal|-| 0 || shockingly slow to heal|}

===Disease resistance===
Reduces the effects of resistable syndromes, increases the speed at which one gains a resistance to resistable syndromes, and reduces the chance of wounds being infected. The dwarven median disease resistance of 1000 is exactly the human average. Having a disease resistance of 5000 does not grant immunities.

{| class=wikitable style="width:400px;"

==Soul attributes==
The attribute values given in the tables correspond to default racial averages for dwarves only. Modded dwarves or any other creature will report the same phrases, but the underlying numbers may be very different. In almost every case, a higher attribute value is better, as opposed to [[personality trait]]s where one may prefer higher or lower depending on the situation.

With respect to skills: most of these attributes only affect duration, when that is the only available skill effect to begin with, but they are factored into outcomes when it applies.

Notes:
*Spatial Sense and Kinesthetic Sense are almost everywhere
*Nothing trains Disease Resistance or Recuperation
*Intimidator and Comedian, both social skills, raise Agility. Dwarven comedy is slapstick/clowning, not stand-up.
*Student skill doesn't boost skill gain except for teacher-student relations in a barracks
*Choose high-volume labors that train useful attributes for militia day-jobs/bootcamp
*Fishing, Siege Operating, and Record Keeping are useful for marksdwarves as they train the Focus attribute
*Hunting (ambusher/sneak) has identical attribute gain to Crossbow and Archer skills

== Dwarf attributes ==

Each attribute is a number between 0 and 5000, but in dwarven terms anything below 200 is rare [http://dffd.bay12games.com/file.php?id=5882] and anything above 2500 is extraordinary. In the default raws (/raw/objects/creature_standard.txt), dwarven attributes come in four levels. 

Focus and Spatial Sense are referred to as "++", or two steps above default. Their range is defined as [700:1200:1400:1500:1600:1800:2500], which sets out six ranges: 700-1200, 1200-1400, etc. Dwarves have an equal chance of dropping into any of these ranges, and an equal probability again of getting any number in that range. So the bottom one-sixth of your dwarves will be really low, the top one-sixth really high, and the two-thirds in the middle huddled around average. This also means that the median and the mean are slightly different: the mean for ++ is 1516.66... while median is 1500.

Strength, Toughness, Analytical Ability, Creativity, Patience, and Memory are +, or one step above default. Their ranges are [450:950:1150:1250:1350:1550:2250], and their mean is 1266.66...

Endurance, Disease Resistance, Recuperation, Intuition, Willpower, Kinesthetic Sense, Linguistic Ability, Musicality, Empathy, and Social Awareness are AVG, or the default. Their ranges are not specified in the raws, but they are [200:700:900:1000:1100:1300:2000] for Physical and [200:800:900:1000:1100:1300:2000] for Mental.

Agility is "-", the only attribute to be below default. Its ranges are [150:600:800:900:1000:1100:1500], mean 870.83..., median 900.

It would seem that various skills train various attributes at different rates. For physical attributes and Willpower, military training works best - it relatively quickly gives a dwarf some extra Agility and Strength, making them walk and work faster in all areas (According to [http://www.bay12forums.com/smf/index.php?topic=121573.msg3944723#msg3944723] speed is a factor in determining how fast a labor is completed).  

According to [https://www.reddit.com/r/dwarffortress/comments/zquv8f/psa_you_can_build_a_gym_for_your_military_with/] Reddit post, strength and stamina can be trained via screw pumps reasonably quickly. The pumps don't have to be adjacent to any liquids, and dwarves will still operate them, pumping air.

Plant gathering trains Agility, Kinesthetic Sense, and Memory to a lesser degree. After a couple of years, plant gatherers become the faster dwarves in the fortress and are generally suitable for transfer to any demanding job.

All attribute values are capped based on their initial value, the attribute's {{token|MENT_ATT_CAP_PERC}} or {{token|PHYS_ATT_CAP_PERC}} value (which defaults to 200), and the attribute's ''median'' value (i.e. the middle value in {{token|PHYS_ATT_RANGE}} or {{token|MENT_ATT_RANGE}}) - the exact cap is either ``(starting_value * ATT_CAP_PERC) / 100`` or ``starting_value + ATT_RANGE.MEDIAN``, whichever is higher.

The speed of learning attributes is governed by "cost to improve" in {{token|PHYS_ATT_RATES}} and {{token|MENT_ATT_RATES}}. By default CTI for attributes is 500, which means the counter for using that attribute has to be incremented 500 times for the dwarf to gain 1 in that attribute. The lower the CTI, the faster an attribute increases. According to [http://www.bay12forums.com/smf/index.php?topic=66525.msg3993120#msg3993120] the counter is incremented every ten ticks a skill using that attribute is in use. This means it takes 5000 TUs or just over 4 in-game days of continuous labor to improve an attribute by 1. The improved attribute gain from military training may stem from the fact that sparring and individual combat drills train multiple skills at the same time.

==Standard ranges==

The game comes pre-stocked with several sets of attribute ranges, some better than others. The signs that come after the numeral ranges indicate what level that range represents, but have no effect in and of themselves.
