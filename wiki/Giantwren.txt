'''Giant wrens''' are massive flying [[creature]]s that appear in most [[savage]] [[biome]]s rather frequently. Much larger than a normal [[wren]] and nearly four times the size of the average [[dwarf]], they will scare [[Domestic animal|livestock]] and cause constant job cancellation spam whenever they appear in the surface, but unlike other more aggressive flying giants, they are benign and will avoid actually harming your civilians. They are considered exotic mounts, so you may see [[Elf|elves]] riding them into battle in the event of a [[siege]].

They are handy for the production of [[meat]], [[bones]] and [[tallow]] thanks to their great size. Being birds, they can be [[Animal trainer|tamed]] and will lay delicious [[egg]]s if a [[nest box]] is provided. Both of these make them a colossal boon for a highly populated fortress.

Some dwarves [[Preferences|like]] giant wrens for their ''intricate songs''.
