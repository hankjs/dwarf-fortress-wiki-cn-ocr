'''Soaper''' is the skill associated with the '''soap making''' [[labor]]. Soap makers create [[soap]] from [[tallow]] or [[oil]], and [[lye]] at the [[Soap maker's workshop]]. The soap can then be used for [[cleaning]] or as a [[construction]] material. Soap has no quality modifiers, so any dwarf can be assigned the task and yield the same result; the only difference is faster production. 

Soap is critical to avoid infections in wounded dwarves.

<!-- Reference: "Fight Club" drama film with a soap maker main character. -->
Skilled Soapers are sometimes also known for their unusually high skill in [[combat skill|fighting]], and have even been known to establish [[guild|guilds]] dedicated to demonstrating such skills. It is rumored that the reason such guildhalls are not possible to create normally is because such guilds are very secretive, and both the first and second rules governing their members are to never speak of the fighters guild. It is also said that all newcomers to such guilds must also participate in a fighting demonstration if it is their first time attending.
