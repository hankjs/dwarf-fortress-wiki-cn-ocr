'''Giant tapirs''' are [[creature]]s found in [[savage]] [[tropical]] moist broadleaf [[forest]]s; the much larger cousin of the common [[tapir]]. They are considerably larger than both [[Dwarf|dwarves]] and normal tapirs, weighting nearly 2 tons - about 28 times heavier than the average Urist - though despite their great size, they are as benign as their common cousins and will react to attackers by trying to run away from them. Note, however, that they can deal massive damage to dwarves in the event they do fight back, so it's good to keep an eye open. Like normal tapirs, a baby giant tapir is named a ''giant tapir calf''.

Giant tapirs can be captured in [[cage]] [[trap]]s and [[Animal trainer|trained]] into [[pet]]s, possessing the standard value of giant creatures. Their huge size means they give a very good amount of returns when [[butcher]]ed, and like normal tapirs, they also serve as a source of [[milk]] and later [[cheese]]. Note, however, that giant tapir milk and normal-sized tapir milk are completely identical in every aspect. They are exotic [[mount]]s, and so may be used by [[Elf|elves]] during [[siege]]s.

Some dwarves [[Preferences|like]] giant tapirs for their ''floppy noses''.
