[[File:construction_preview_anim.gif|thumb|198px|right|A dwarf constructing a [[still]].]]'''Constructions''' are buildings such as [[floor]]s, [[wall]]s, and [[stairs]]. They can be made of [[boulder]]s, [[log]]s, [[block]]s, and [[bar]]s of any solid material—including [[wood]], [[stone]], [[metal]], [[glass]], [[clay]], and are accessible in the build menu by {{menu icon|b|n}}.

Unlike most objects accessed from the {{menu icon|b}} build menu, constructions are treated as inert terrain features when completed, with a few limitations as described below. Some constructions can only be interacted with by looking at them or by pressing {{menu icon|m|x}} to designate their removal. Clicking on such will give no information after the construction is completed, but will allow [[removal]], suspension, and an idea of the current status before the construction is complete.

== Required labors ==

In order to make a construction, a dwarf must have the "Wall/Floor Construction" [[labor]] enabled, found under the "Other Jobs" heading.

The [[mining]] labor is required for removing constructions, regardless of the material the construction is made from.

== Constructions and mines ==

Constructions are similar to [[Mining|mined out formations]]. However, unlike the [[wall]]s and [[floor]]s surrounding [[Mining|mined]] or [[channel]]ed spaces, constructed features cannot be smoothed, or carved into minecart tracks unless blocks are used, though they can be engraved. In order to construct [[smoothing|smooth]] stone [[wall]]s and [[floor]]s, [[block]]s need to be used in place of raw [[stone]]; smooth constructions can be engraved as normal. [[Wood]], [[metal]], and [[glass]] constructions are not considered either rough or smooth, but in the case of wood, building with [[block]]s will increase room value - [[metal]] [[bar]]s have the same value as metal blocks and are thus interchangeable (though blocks may be preferred to simplify resource tracking), and glass can ''only'' be used in block form.

== Order of construction ==

Constructions, when equidistant to dwarf{{Verify}}, are built in a Last-In-First-Out (LIFO) order. That means that whichever constructions are ordered first will be built last. Also, if there is a large group of constructions being built, and a new set of constructions is ordered, the constructions in progress will be ignored until the new constructions are finished. 

If you place a single multi-tile order, as in the case of a long bridge or wide walkway over a gap or river, then that will be treated as a "single order".  It will be built logically, from connected locations out, but it, as a single "order", will be addressed in sequence according to the rules of LIFO.  Note that "logic" does ''not'' include building corners of a wall first, and so can result in un-reachable tiles.  Use LIFO to avoid this - designate the main line of wall first (perhaps leaving a 1-tile additional space), ''then'' designate the corners; using LIFO, the corners will then be built before the main line, and you can fill in the last gaps after the hard-to-reach spots are finished.

The exception to this is if you click on the placed construction, and then click "Top Priority". This moves this construction to the front of the list - along with ''all other'' "Top Priority" constructions.  These Top Priority constructions will then be treated as a priority list and finished in Last-In, First-Out order, followed by non-priority constructions in ''their'' LIFO order.

Respecting the LIFO order is also necessary to efficiently and correctly construct [[Tower (project)|multi-z-level walls]].

==Destruction==
Constructions which have not yet been completed are technically Buildings, which permits them to be toppled by building destroyers. Once they are completed, they become map tiles, which are effectively indestructible. Constructions are generally inert, resisting [[building destroyer]]s, but will be destroyed if [[magma]] and [[water]] can interact in the square of the construction to form [[obsidian]], or in a [[cave-in]].  Building and removing a construction can change the floor it is built upon to a default value, removing things like [[engraving]]s and the "magma flow" floor above [[semi-molten rock]].

==Impact on framerate==
Constructions introduce slowdowns from two angles:
# It has to keep track of the original item (though there is a DFHack plugin which will delete the item and flag the construction as "recreate the item from scratch when you deconstruct it"), which means that general item lookups take slightly longer (it's done via binary search, so you'd only notice significant slowdowns each time the item count in your fortress doubles).
# It has to keep track of what the construction is made of, using a separate structure that needs to be looked up for each constructed tile that is visible on the screen. These also use binary searches, though with three values (X+Y+Z coordinates) instead of just one so they're a little bit slower. Typically, you only get noticeable slowdowns when you're building something on the scale of [http://www.bay12forums.com/smf/index.php?topic=43679.0 FlareChannel].
