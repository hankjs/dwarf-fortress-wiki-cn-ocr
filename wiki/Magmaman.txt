'''Magma men''' are dangerous and exceptionally rare inorganic [[construct creature]]s who inhabit the [[magma sea]]. They are composed of an inner liquid [[basalt]] core (which is to say, [[magma]]) and an outer, solid [[obsidian]] layer. As a result, they are much more durable than [[fire imp]]s and especially [[Fire man|fire men]] and their natural attacks are dangerous. They do not breathe [[fire]] or magma in any form, though. Like other inorganic construct creatures, magma men feel no emotion or [[No Exert|exertion]], are [[No Pain|immune to pain]] and [[No Stun|cannot be stunned]]. They are as large as [[human]]s and are immortal, only dying to violence.

Their hot [[temperature]] has the interesting effect of actually [http://mkv25.net/dfma/movie-2120-magmamanforcedevaporation drying up water] if they are submerged in it, as well as melting adjacent unmined [[ice]]. They will create [[steam]] upon touching water and being [[Weather#Rain|rained on]], which will most likely lead to anyone caught in the steam clouds starting to cough. Additionally, they can create bursts of boiling blood if they step in a bloodied area, which displays the message {{DFtext|Magma Man is caught in a burst of boiling blood!|4:1}}. Magma men are Level 2 [[building destroyer]]s, which means that [[door]]s, [[hatch]]es, [[bars]], and other similar constructions are vulnerable to their rampage. When they die, they leave a usable chunk of [[obsidian]] instead of any carcass, although when you consider their rarity, there are much better sources of obsidian around.

Magma men can be captured in [[cage]] [[trap]]s. However, if you use a [[wood]]en cage, it will slowly decay and eventually disappear, letting the magma man free to roam in your fortress, leading to much [[Fun|!FUN!]].

Some dwarves [[Preferences|like]] magma men for their ''flowing movement''.
