'''Hoary marmots''' are small, furry [[creature]]s who inhabit [[mountain]]s, where they appear in groups of 1-4 individuals. They are benign and do little but meander about aimlessly, being harmless to [[dwarves]] save for the occasional job interruption. A young hoary marmot is called a ''hoary marmot pup''.

Hoary marmots can be captured in [[cage]] [[trap]]s and [[Animal trainer|trained]] into exotic [[pet]]s. These can be useful at the beginnings of your [[meat industry]], but do not give enough [[meat]] when butchered to make notable contributions to an advanced fortress' food supplies. They are notably [[grazer]]s and as such require a [[pasture]] to survive if trained, otherwise they may starve to death.

Some dwarves [[Preferences|like]] hoary marmots for their ''whistles''.
