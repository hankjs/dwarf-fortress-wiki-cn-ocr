{{release notes}}
:Here is a release to continue to stabilize the lua update. There are several regular fixes as well, listed below in the patch notes.
:Also, we have some dye improvements for you! You can now mix dyes to produce a variety of colors, and you can tint with dyes to mix the natural color of the material and the color of the dye during the dyeing process. If you make a new world, you'll also have access to some additional outdoor plant dyes. Leather can now be dyed, and there are some new stockpile controls to help you manage all of the new stuff.
:If you want to see your dwarves in their new outfits after you've made some shiny clothes, there's the existing preference setting to show their dyed outfits rather than coloring them by profession.

:It’s Alexandra here with update 52.03 which brings new colour and options for dying and some general fixes and improvements.
