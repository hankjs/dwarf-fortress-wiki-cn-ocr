'''Finger lime''' is one of the many genera of [[tree]]s found above ground. Like the vast majority of above ground trees, finger lime [[wood]] is brown and produces brown products.

Finger lime trees yield [[fruit | finger limes]]. Finger limes cannot be brewed, but can be eaten or cooked.  Due to their unbrewability, the trees are better used as [[bed | beds]], [[cage | cages]] and [[block | dimension lumber]] unless you very desperately need food.

Some [[Dwarf|dwarves]] [[Preferences|like]] finger lime trees for their ''fruit''.
