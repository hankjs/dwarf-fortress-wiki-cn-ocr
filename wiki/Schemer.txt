'''Schemer''' is a [[skill]] presumably used as part of the [[intrigue]] system.

The [[dungeon master]] [[noble]] favors this skill, though its use is not fully understood. Migrants may be experienced in scheming, making them interesting candidates for the position. However, there have been reports of [[villain]]s coming undercover to the fortress, with high scheming skills.

It appears to be possible to slowly train the skill by [[Justice#Interrogation|interrogating]] dwarves.
