'''Surgeon''' is the skill associated with the [[Surgery]] [[labor]], as well as the hospital [[occupation]] associated with it. Surgeons are responsible for treatment of complex overlapping injuries, damage to internal organs, and [[syndrome]]s, using the [[table]]s and [[traction bench]]es at a [[hospital]], bringing your fortress's injured heroes back from the brink as part of the [[health care|health care industry]]. The skill is also used by [[scholars]] when thinking about medical science-related [[topics]].

Surgeon [[skill|skill level]] is related to rate of success and post-operation [[healthcare#Infection|infection]]{{verify}}. The patient must be at rest to perform surgery. If the patient is not at rest, the surgeon will cancel surgery. The patient will stop resting when they get too hungry or thirsty. The patient may cease resting while being carried to the surgery table, if it is a long distance away. Graphically, they wear all black clothes.

Any surgery which is ''not'' performed on a [[table]] (e.g. if the patient is instead resting in a [[bed]]) will have its skill rolls cut in half.

A job to remove necrotic tissue starts with a {{DFtext|Surgery}} job, which appears to be a prep phase, followed by a {{DFtext|Remove Rotten Tissue}} job, after which another {{DFtext|Surgery}} job occurs.  The necrotic tissue is gone at the end of the {{DFtext|Remove Rotten Tissue}} job.  The body parts from which the tissue was removed will be light yellow (oddly, even body parts that were previously darker due to existing injuries).  The initial surgery job will be preceded by a {{DFtext|Clean Patient}} job if possible.
