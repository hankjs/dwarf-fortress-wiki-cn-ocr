'''Giant groupers''' are a species of [[Creature|fish]] who can be found in [[tropical]] [[ocean]]s. Ten times heavier than a [[dwarf]], they provide a great amount of returns when [[butcher]]ed. As non-[[vermin]] fish, giant groupers can't be fished by [[Fisherdwarf|fisherdwarves]], but can be caught with the use of a [[drowning chamber]]. Infant giant groupers are called ''grouper fry''.

Note that, despite the name, giant groupers aren't [[savage]] versions of a normal grouper. They're an actual animal with "giant" in its name.

Some dwarves [[Preferences|like]] giant groupers for their ''lips''.
