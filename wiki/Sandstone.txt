{{For/see|the month|[[Calendar]]}}

'''Sandstone''' is a [[sedimentary layer]] of [[stone]]. It can sometimes contain an [[aquifer]], can be found along the [[ocean]] shore, and is also named for the eighth month of the dwarven [[calendar]], covering mid-Autumn.

==In real life==

Sandstone is a sedimentary stone composed of broken pieces of minerals, usually quartz or [[Orthoclase|potassium feldspar]], cemented together with either the minerals [[hematite]] (Fe<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>), [[calcite]] (CaCO<sub>3</sub>), or silica (SiO<sub>2</sub>), or through sheer pressure compacting the grains together. When the individual grains are larger than 2 millimeters, the stone is called a [[conglomerate]] if the grains are rounded, or a breccia (not present in ''Dwarf Fortress'') if the grains have sharp points or angles. If the individual grains are smaller than 1/16th of a millimeter, the stone is called a [[siltstone]]. When sandstone is exposed to high heat, such as through [[magma]] coming into contact with the stone, the grains melt and are recrystallized, forming the stone [[quartzite]]. It is found in numerous colors, the most common being yellow, red, gray, white, tan, and brown.
