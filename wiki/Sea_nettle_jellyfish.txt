'''Sea nettle jellyfish''' are a type of aquatic [[vermin]] found in [[temperate]] [[ocean]]s year-round, unless the water freezes, in which case they will be wiped out and come back next year. They are a ready source of [[food]] when [[fish cleaning|cleaned]] at a [[fishery]]. Sea nettle jellyfish are distinct for being the only species of vermin capable of [[beaching]], though being vermin, this already-rare behaviour is even more difficult to notice.

Some [[dwarves]] [[Preferences|like]] sea nettle jellyfish for their ''beauty''.
