== Synopsis ==
The series was intended to follow the seven dwarfs calling themselves "The Dead Eye-Jailer" from a dwarven civilization known as The Lance of Oiling, in their undertaking to reclaim it and jail the cyclops Sedurlitast Ushdishokang who had taken over the fortress of Nokörtorad, Deadbody. With the cyclops rushing out right after embark and killing all but one dwarf, Stâkud Konosakgos, who ran away from the slaughter. Being on her own without food in an arctic biome full of reanimating zombies biome, with her former friends rising and longing for her flesh, Stâkud was in a dire spot. 

She eventually managed to get into the fortress while locking the cyclops outside. As Stâkud was lucky enough to have been able to grab a pick when still on the outside, she managed to dig down to the caverns and hunt for [Crundle]s meat and collecting seeds for cave wheat and sweet pods. With the resources for food and drinks gathered, Stâkud built herself a still and started to produce some alcohol. Around this time, it became clear the fortress was hunted by the ghosts of its former inhabitants. Stâkud started to carve memorial slabs for each new ghost she encountered. This was the start of Nokörtorad's remembrance hall. Over time, a number of dwarfs from its founding party of became immortalized there to calm their ghosts.

About a year later and totally unexpected, a group of 2 adults and two children along with a cat and a yak showed up. The adults, being capable woodcutters, seemed to grasp the danger immediately, forming a small squad and clearing out some of the dwarf zombies in their way with their axes. Steadly heading with their kids to towards a mountain ridge through which Stâkud quickly dug a tunnel to usher the group in. The plan worked, and only the yak had to be left behind. This brought Nokörtorads population to five dwarves. To make her new friends feel welcome, Stâkud dug out some spacious bedrooms, as the horrors of their arrival and the sparse living conditions seem to draw on their mood.

A dwarven caravan of merchants appearing a few days later was less lucky and got slaughtered by the zombies. A further migrant wave fled when encountering the zombies. Leaving behind a piglet that soon was killed by the zombies. Only to reanimated to become a zombie piglet.

Due to the need of wood the dwarves decided to venture into the caverns to clean out the hordes of undead crundles sweeping into the fortress in waves. The military of 3, wearing water buffalo bone armor, actually manged to inflict a dent within the zombie crundles. But all through a vicious fight with two seriously wounded dwarfs rushed to a makeshift hospital.

Six more migrants made it to the entrance tunnel at the ridge later that year, bringing the population to 11. While the new hands had been highly appreciated, the new faces caused a food crisis. Another group of migrants had to be turned away due to the food situation not stabilizing otherwise. As the caves became totally overrun with undead, an underground tree farm got established. The caverns got sealed off right after. To raise the mood within Nokörtorad a new meeting hall was build and furnished.

To handle the zombie population outside, an ingenious dwarven plan to dispose the zombies was enacted. The undead were trapped in cages and dumped into a deep pit. The corpses mangling each other when dropped onto one another. In the process, the Cyclopse returned to the fortress trap zone. The dwarfs of Nokörtorad decided to delay the mission and avoided facing the cyclops. They came up with a new trap tunnel design: a spiral tunnel spiked with stone fall traps. When the Tunnel was finally opened, it took only seconds for Sedurlitast Ushdishokang to rush in. Making it through 31 traps before being finally slain. In the end the cyclops was overcome. 

In honor of her six dead friends killed right after their embark, Stâkud commissioned an updated version of the memorial chamber. Depicting each of them in a statue. All facing a statue of Sedurlitast the cyclops next to his rotting bones. A testament to what a single dwarf can do.
