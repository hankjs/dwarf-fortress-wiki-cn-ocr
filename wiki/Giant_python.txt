'''Giant pythons''' are [[Giant animal|the]] [[list of creatures by adult size#end_of_list|largest snakes]] in the game, larger than [[hippo]]s and [[walrus]]es. While not [[syndrome|poisonous]], their bite is strong enough to reliably tear entire limbs off your dwarves, [[armor]] and all. They should only be approached by multiple seasoned military dwarves in full [[armor|regalia]], or better yet, avoided entirely.

Giant pythons can be [[cage trap|captured]] and [[tame]]d. With 10 to 30 eggs per clutch, they will breed exponentially if you manage to get a couple of them. Giant pythons require 20 years of growth to reach full size, but only live 10-20 years, meaning they rarely reach their most imposing size.

Some dwarves [[preference|admire]] giant pythons for their ''great size''.
