'''Igneous intrusive''' [[stone layers]] can consist of [[granite]], [[diorite]], or [[gabbro]], all of which typically contain [[gold]] and [[tetrahedrite]].

Gabbro can also contain [[garnierite]] (the ore of [[nickel]]), [[kimberlite]] (which may contain [[diamond]]s), and [[olivine]] (which may contain [[native platinum]]).  Granite can contain [[cassiterite]] (the ore of [[tin]]), [[bismuthinite]] (the ore of [[bismuth]]), and [[galena]] (the ore of [[lead]], plus a 50% chance of silver).

==In the real world==
Igneous intrusive [[stone]] is formed by magma solidification occurring below the surface, as opposed to [[Igneous extrusive layer|igneous extrusive]] stone, which forms above the surface of the earth.
