'''Maples''' are a type of [[above ground]] [[tree]], found in nearly any [[temperate]] region with [[plants|vegetation]]. Like the overwhelming majority of overland trees, maple [[carpenter|wood]] is brown and produces brown products. Logs can be processed in a [[dyer's shop]] into light brown [[dye]].

Maples produce '''Maple leaves''' and '''Maple samaras''', which cannot be stockpiled, brewed or cooked at present, nor is there any current means to extract maple syrup from maple trees. Cut them freely.

Some [[Dwarf|dwarves]] [[Preferences|like]] maples for their ''autumn coloration''.

Although some attempts to pulp the tree for "syrup" have been unsuccessful, many continue trying.
