'''Flasks''' are containers used by dwarves to carry [[alcohol]] or [[water]] while hunting, or on military duty.
There are three different items which fall under this definition:

A single job creates three flasks, waterskins or vials.

Flasks and waterskins are functionally equivalent. Vials can be used as flasks or waterskins, and are also used to make [[extracts]]; however, soldiers will sometimes choose to use filled vials to store drinks.{{bug|3116}} Flasks and waterskins ''cannot'' be used to make extracts.  Flasks can hold up to three units of alcohol or water - alcohol is preferable to water, as it prevents unhappy thoughts and doesn't freeze in low temperatures. Soldiers can be told how to fill their flasks from the {{menu icon|q}} [[squad]] interface -> equip -> supplies. When not in use, flasks will be stored in [[finished good]]s stockpiles.

As above, flasks and waterskins are functionally equivalent, except, due to the material, flasks are more expensive in character creation. Either will initially be filled with water.

To drink from a container, hit {{Adv menu icon|e}} and choose "water" (or whatever it is filled with). To fill any container, stand next to a liquid water source, {{Adv menu icon|i}} interact with the container and choose "fill"; they can also be filled from [[contaminant|pools]] of other liquids, such as blood; or with snow, though not [[ice]]; or from containers in the same tile, like barrels or jugs.

In adventurer mode, the water in any container will freeze after some time in cold enough weather. The resulting ice can be licked instead of drunk, but doesn't quench thirst or melt from this action; however, the ice can be melted using a [[campfire]], by {{Adv menu icon|I}} interacting with either the container or the ice.

A flask or waterskin can be {{Adv menu icon|w}} worn inside an item of body clothing, defaulting to the upper body. If an adventurer is wearing nothing on their upper and lower body, they will not be able to wear either. If all other items are removed from the body part that the flask or waterskin is worn on, it will be dropped when time passes. Wearing either does not appear to affect the freezing of its contents. The ''Be extravagant'' [[need]] is not satisfied by wearing an improved-[[quality]] flask or waterskin, probably because they are worn '''in''' clothing instead of on a body part.

[[Dungeon guardian]]s in [[mysterious dungeon]]s carry waterskins that contain a [[mythical substance]], which can heal those who consume it, even regrowing limbs.
