'''Emus''' are [[Creature|birds]] who inhabit [[temperate]] [[shrubland]]s and [[forest]]s, appearing in groups of anywhere between 2-10 individuals. They are half the size of a [[human]] (a little over half the size of an adult [[dwarf]]) and are entirely benign, doing little but meandering about aimlessly. They'll normally flee if confronted in combat, but on rare occasions may attempt to defend themselves, primarily with kick attacks.

Emus can be captured in [[cage]] [[trap]]s and [[Animal trainer|trained]] into exotic [[pet]]s. They produce a good quantity of returns when [[butcher]]ed and lay a fairly high amount of [[egg]]s if placed in a [[nest box]], opening the opportunity for an emu farm. Among the ratite birds in the game (emus, [[ostrich]]es and [[Cassowary|cassowaries]]), emus are the smallest and shortest-lived of the three.

Some dwarves [[Preferences|like]] emus for their ''size'' and their ''inquisitive nature''.

<!-- Reference: Australian [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emu_War| 'mythology'] -->
One human kingdom is historically famed for losing a bloody war against emus, despite having the reputation of wrestling [[saltwater crocodile]]s into the ground and killing [[dingo]]es with their bare hands. They handled the loss fairly well, however, considering they love to joke about it to their dwarf friends. Although many dwarven [[scholar]]s do not believe most of those claims (any self-respecting Scientists will scoff at the thought of a small handheld ballista being capable of firing 500 times a minute), this is just another proof that humans are much better than those damned elves.
