'''Rhesus macaques''' are small [[creature]]s found in many [[temperate]] [[biome]]s, spawning in loose groups of 5 to 10 individuals with the intent to [[Thief|steal]] [[Steals food|your]] [[Steals items|fortress]] - they are not cute little chimps that wear tiny tuxedos and dance to calypso music. They are larger, meaner, and considerably more likely to leave teeth marks in the neck of any working [[dwarf]] foolish enough to get in their way. If they exist on a map, they ''will'' be trouble at one point or another. They are known for stealing pretty much everything, including [[food]], [[Finished goods|items]], [[weapons]], [[armor]], and [[Legendary artifact|artifacts]]. [[Weight]] is no consideration; they'll steal your one and only [[anvil]] as quickly as they will your bag of [[plump helmet]] seeds. All rhesus macaques are born with Legendary [[skill]] in [[Climber|climbing]].

Fortunately, they can be dispatched without too much trouble due to their small size, and will often flee when faced with even the most ludicrously underpowered militia. War [[dog]]s will also usually make quick work of them, though it is generally recommended to take all important items underground as soon as possible when embarking in a macaque-inhabited area, as a group of them can quickly swarm an undefended [[Wagon (embark)|wagon]]. They are essentially flightless [[kea]] and should be treated accordingly.

Rhesus macaques can be captured in [[cage]] [[trap]]s and [[Animal trainer|trained]] into low-value [[pet]]s. While they can be bred to supplement a [[meat industry]], they are small and yield few products when [[butcher]]ed. They also take 3 years to reach adulthood, much longer than [[Cow|more]] [[Water buffalo|accessible]] sources of food, which may not be worth waiting for.

Some dwarves [[Preferences|like]] rhesus macaques for their ''mischief''.

{{D for Dwarf}}
It has been suggested by some that diced rhesus macaque meat cooked with [[dwarven syrup]] is used for a tasty dwarven candy, or Rhesus Pieces. [http://www.bay12games.com/forum/index.php?topic=46408.msg922819#msg922819]

Some [[insane]] dwarves find the mammalian features of macaques exceptionally hilarious, laughing hysterically as they run around giggling "Macaques really hairy!" All dwarves who exhibit this symptom defy all laws of insanity by showing no signs that they would become insane; One case even had a dwarf return to normal life before being eaten alive by a group of hungry, hungry [[hippo]]s.
