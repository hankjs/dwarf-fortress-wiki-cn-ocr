:''For a comparison of different weapons, see [[Weapon]].''

[[File:scimitar_sprite_preview.png|right]]A '''scimitar''' is an [[attack types|edged]] [[weapon]] with a curved blade that is very similar to a [[short sword]]. In fact, the only differentiating factor appears to be the contact area of the pommel, which is half the size of those on a short sword. 

Scimitars use and train the [[swordsdwarf]] skill. As foreign weapons, dwarves cannot [[forge]] scimitars, limiting supply to whatever low-[[quality]] specimens can be traded from human [[caravan]]s or scavenged from invaders. All dwarves can equip scimitars, though, like short swords, [[Weapon#Size|a tiny fraction must use two hands]]. Given their marked similarity to short swords, your dwarves are almost certainly better served by equipping high-quality short swords.
