'''Ospreys''' are a species of [[Creature|bird]] who can be found in [[water]]-heavy [[biome]]s such as [[ocean]]s, [[lake]]s, [[river]]s and [[marsh]]es, where they spawn individually. Despite being carnivorous, they are benign and under half the size of a [[cat]], doing nothing but fly across the area aimlessly, proving no threat to a [[dwarf]] whatsoever. All ospreys are born with Legendary [[skill]] in [[Climber|climbing]].

Ospreys can be captured in [[cage]] [[trap]]s and [[Animal trainer|trained]] into cheap exotic [[pet]]s. They produce a tiny amount of returns when [[butcher]]ed and lay an average of 3 [[egg]]s at a time, making them poor choices for livestock.

Some dwarves [[Preferences|like]] ospreys for their ''fishing ability''.
