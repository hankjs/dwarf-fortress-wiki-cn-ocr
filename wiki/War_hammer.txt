:''For a comparison of different weapons, see [[Weapon]].''

[[File:war_hammer_sprite_preview.png|right]]A '''war hammer''' is a [[attack types|blunt]] [[weapon]] that is essentially a hammer with a long handle. A war hammer is half the size of a [[mace]] with half the contact area as well, and less than 1/3 the size of a [[maul]]. Because blunt damage focused in a small contact area is mostly unaffected by [[armor]], war hammers are considered one of the best weapons for fighting humanoid opponents. 

War hammers use and train the [[hammerdwarf]] skill. Dwarves can [[forge]] effective war hammers out of any weapons-grade [[metal]], though those with higher [[density|densities]] (like [[silver]]) or higher impact fracture/yields (like [[steel]]) tend to cause more damage. All dwarves can equip war hammers, though [[Weapon#Size|a tiny fraction must use two hands]].

== Forging and melting ==
* Metal war hammers cost '''one''' [[metal]] bar to [[forge]], or '''three''' [[adamantine]] wafers.
* When a non-adamantine metal war hammer is [[melt|melted down]], it will return '''0.9''' metal bars, for an '''efficiency of 90%'''.
* When an adamantine war hammer is melted down, it will produce '''0.9''' wafers, for an '''efficiency of 30%'''
