{{DFtext|Dwarf cancels task: Handling dangerous creature.}}

This message occurs when a dwarf who is handling any larger-than-[[vermin]] [[creature]] is assigned another non-creature-handling task. Note that this is generally a "soft cancel" (meaning the task will be reissued to another dwarf eventually), however, constructions may be [[suspend]]ed, requiring player intervention. 

This error is relatively common with both [[milking]] and [[shearing]] tasks, but can be reduced and/or eliminated by limiting the labors enabled on your animal-handling dwarves, and dedicating a specific [[farmer's workshop]] solely for creature-handling tasks.
