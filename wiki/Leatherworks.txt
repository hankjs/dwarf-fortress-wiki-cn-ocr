'''Leather works''' is a [[workshop]] which produces [[leather]] items out of tanned [[skin|hides]] made at the [[tanner's shop]]. These items include [[armor]], [[backpack]]s, [[flask|waterskins]], [[quiver]]s for [[military]] dwarves, and [[clothes]] and [[bag]]s for civilian use. [[Armor#Types_of_armor|Leather armor]] is significantly less protective than metal armor, but is [[Armor#Encumbrance|lighter and thus better]] for initial [[Armor user|armor wearing]] training and for [[Squad|squads]] that value [[gait|movement speed]] over defensive ability. 

[[Decoration|Decorating]] [[finished goods]] with leather is also done at this workshop.

[[Crafts]] made from leather are made at the [[craftsdwarf's workshop]]. 

To create differently sized clothing or armor, request it to be made from the workshop as usual. Afterwards, go back to the main workshop menu and, by [[File:Mag glass icon.png]] button, set the details of the issued job. Click specify size, search for a species ([[Humans|e.g. humans]]), and click their name in the list.
