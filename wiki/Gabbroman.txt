'''Gabbro men''' are extremely rare [[construct creature]]s made of solid [[gabbro]], found exclusively at the third layer of the [[caverns]]. Like other construct creatures, they are non-sentient, [[No Pain|feel no pain]] or fear, [[No Stun|cannot be stunned]] and don't need to breathe. They are as large as [[human]]s and are level 2 [[building destroyer]]s. Gabbro men are immortal and only die to violence.

Gabbro men are deadly to the average [[dwarf]] and will usually kill unarmed civilians. Punches and kicks will glance away from their stone hide, but some may deliver lucky bites which can fracture them. Gabbro men should nonetheless be engaged with an equipped [[military]] before they can wreak havoc among dwarves and buildings. When killed, gabbro men turn into a rough gabbro boulder which can be used by your [[mason]]s or [[stone crafter]]s. They can't be spawned in the [[object testing arena]].

Some dwarves [[Preferences|like]] gabbro men for their ''rockiness''.

Despite many rumored sightings and artistic depictions, there is no [[human]] that has become an orange gabbro man through a teleportation experiment. It has also been stated that this particular gabbro man has allied himself with three other humans with supernatural abilities.
