'''Giant tigers''' are strong carnivorous animals, roaming savage [[tropical]] areas. Adult giant tigers are more than three times the size of a standard [[cow]]. Giant tigers may also appear as [[mount]]s during a [[siege]].

Captured giant tigers may be [[tame]]d and kept as [[pet]]s, [[animal trainer|trained]] for hunting or war, or bred as livestock for a [[meat industry]]. While they do not produce as much meat as some other "giant" creatures, giant tiger [[butcher]]ing returns are worth four times as much as those of common domestic animals.

Giant tigers are well-suited for [[military]] service, as they are by far the biggest of all the giant cats and breed relatively rapidly. Even untrained, giant tigers present a formidable defense for a fortress. As [[grazer|non-grazers]], giant tigers don't require a [[pasture]], and so need no special attention after taming.

Some dwarves [[preference|prefer]] giant tigers for their ''large stripes, of course''.
