[[File:wool_sprite_preview.png|right]]'''Wool''' is produced after [[shearing]] (or [[butcher]]ing) one of a {{catlink|Shearable|handful of animals}}, currently [[llama]]s, [[alpaca]]s, [[troll]]s, and [[sheep]]. Animals can be sheared again to produce more wool after 300 days  have passed. Wool is stored in a refuse stockpile under Hair/Wool and appears under [[Body parts]] in the [[stocks]] menu. Wool can be [[spinner|spun]] into [[yarn]] [[thread]]s, which can then be woven into [[cloth]] at a [[loom]] and used to create a variety of textile products such as [[bag]]s, [[clothing]], [[rope]]s or [[crafts]]. ''(For a full discussion of the process and possibilities, see [[textile industry]].)''
