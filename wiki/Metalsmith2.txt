[[File:metalsmith_sprite_preview.png|right]]'''Metalsmith''' is a category [[profession]] that encompasses any or all skills relating to the [[smelting]] of [[metal]]s and [[alloy]]s and the crafting of various metal products, including metal [[armor]] and [[weapon]]s, metal [[furniture]], [[chain]]s, metal [[toy]]s, [[bucket]]s and [[barrel]]s, metal [[bar]]s or [[block]]s, and so on.  Although each of these may require a separate [[skill]] to produce, they are all grouped together under the [[profession]] of "Metalsmith".

The 5 metalsmith skills are:
{{Skill Box|Metalsmith|0:1|0:1|
* [[Armorsmith]]
* [[Furnace operator]]
* [[Metal crafter]]
* [[Blacksmith]]
* [[Weaponsmith]]}}
<br>
An adult [[dwarf]] whose best [[skill]] is in this category, and who has accumulated ranks in other metalsmithing skills*, will be labeled with the "Metalsmith" profession and known as a metalsmith.  If a dwarf has [[experience]] in only one metalsmithing skill and that is her/his highest skill, s/he will be known by that skill.  If a dwarf has several metalsmith skills, once they achieve "grand master" skill (Rank 14) in one of these skills, but not in any of the others, s/he will then be known by that specific skill.

: ''(* exactly how much is not clear) ''

Dwarves with any metalsmithing labor, excluding [[furnace operating]], are needed to construct many types of metal buildings if they are made of metal: these include [[trade depot]]s, [[bridge]]s, [[furnace]]s, and [[well]]s. ''(see [[#Bugs|"known bug"]] below)''.

==Bugs==
* Buildings which are built using material-dependent labors (e.g. a trade depot) may require "any metalsmithing skill," but will ''only'' check and raise the [[blacksmithing|blacksmith]] skill, not any other qualifying "metalsmith" skill (e.g. weaponsmithing).  The [[quality]] of any such buildings is based off this skill alone. {{Bug|4899}} {{Verify|is this still true in v50 with the changes that have been made to metalsmith labors?}}
