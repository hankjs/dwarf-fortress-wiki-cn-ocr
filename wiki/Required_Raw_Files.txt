''This article is based on version 0.43.05.  It may not be accurate to the latest release.''

The following is a list of files in the raw/objects/ folder necessary for ''Dwarf Fortress'' version 43.05; removing them causes unpredictable behavior, mostly crashing, in different parts of the game because they provide definitions for tokens hard-coded into the executable:
*b_detail_plan.txt - provides required body detail plan tokens for the [[object testing arena]] and [[world generation]]
*body_default.txt - provides the body part tokens used to define [[creature]]s
*body_rcp.txt - provides the body part tokens used to randomly generate creatures
*c_variation_default.txt - provides creature variation tokens required by the object testing arena and world generation
*creature_standard.txt - defines [[Dwarf|dwarves]] and standard creatures.
*descriptor_color_standard.txt - provides color definitions required by the object testing arena and world generation
*descriptor_pattern_iris_eye.txt - provides descriptions for creature irises
*descriptor_pattern_pupil_eye.txt - provides descriptions for creature pupils.
*descriptor_shape_standard.txt - provides descriptions for shapes required by the testing arena and world generation.
*entity_default.txt - defines various civilizations
*inorganic_metal.txt - allows dwarves to [[Miner|dig]] and defines various [[metal]]s for the dwarves to dig.
*inorganic_stone_layer.txt - required for world generation
*interaction_standard.txt - defines interactions required for world generation.
*item_ammo.txt - defines [[ammo]] used by dwarves
*item_armor.txt - defines [[armor]] used by dwarves
*item_gloves.txt - defines gloves used by dwarves
*item_helm.txt - defines helmets used by dwarves
*item_pants.txt - defines pants used by dwarves
*item_shield.txt - defines shield items used by dwarves
*item_shoes.txt - defines shoes used by dwarves
*item_seigeammo.txt - defines [[Siege engine|siege ammo]] used by dwarves
*item_tool.txt - defines [[tool]]s used by dwarves
*item_toy.txt - defines toys used by dwarves
*item_trapcomp.txt - defines [[trap]] components used by dwarves.
*item_weapon.txt - defines [[weapon]]s used by dwarves
*language_DWARF.txt - defines the [[Main:Dwarven language|dwarf language]]
*language_SYM.txt - defines the grammar of different words
*language_words.txt - defnes words used by the system
*material_template_default.txt - defines materials required by object testing and dwarves
*plant_standard.txt - defines standard [[plant]]s required for dwarves
*tissue_template_default.txt - defines tissue tokens used to define body parts.

Additionally, the following files in the raw/objects/text/ folder are required to play ''Dwarf Fortress'' because the relative file paths are hard-coded into the executable.
*secret_death.txt
*book_instruction.txt
*book_art.txt

Note that these files are required, but their contents seem meaningless; the game will crash if they are not found or if they are empty.

inorganic_stone_layer.txt is required for [[fortress mode]].
The ability to dig is provided by inorganic_metal, probably because inorganic_metal defines metals that can be used to create picks.

A [https://github.com/jgibbons94/Dwarf-Fortress-Minimalist-RAW github repository] exists that contains these files and incomplete documentation on what they do.
