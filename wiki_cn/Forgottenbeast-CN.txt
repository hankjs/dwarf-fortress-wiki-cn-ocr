:''在深处，有如此凶残和可怕的野兽，只有它们自己知道它们是什么，因为见过它们的人都没有活下来讲述...它们是遗忘之兽，诞生于世界诞生之前的混沌...它们等待着，在世界的黑暗之地沉思...而现在...通过挖掘得太深...我们唤醒了它们。''
[[File:forgotten_beast_preview.png|right]]'''遗忘之兽'''是[[titan|泰坦]]的地下等价物；大型、凶残、程序生成的[[megabeast|巨兽]]，它们在你要塞下方的[[caverns|洞穴]]或[[HFS]]中生成, [[path|寻路]]到你的要塞并在你的[[dwarves|矮人]]中播下毁灭。 它们被[[wealth|财富]]和[[noise|噪音]]吸引，这可以在[[Difficulty#Forgotten_beasts|难度]][[settings|设置]]中调整。 此外，当你回收一个要塞时，可能会随机出现一只。 当遗忘之兽在屏幕上可见时，游戏会自动暂停并显示消息。

在图形上，遗忘之兽使用的精灵将是随机生成的生物，具有与它们被赋予的生成外观相似的随机颜色。 这种设置也用于其他程序生成的生物，例如泰坦、[[demon|恶魔]]、[[experiment|实验体]]和[[bogeyman|食人妖]]。

== 生成 ==
{{random image|location=right|size=300px}}
{{imagefix|[[File:forgotten_beast_icon.png|left]]|6}}遗忘之兽是程序随机化的，可以是任何形式，由任何材料制成。 多只遗忘之兽可能会来攻击你的要塞，每只在不同时间到来。 Most take the form of an animal, [[Random creature profile|some not found in vanilla DF]], with extra features (e.g. extra eyes, feathers) or removed body parts (e.g. skinless cobras) and unusual colours. However, a forgotten beast can also take more generic forms, such as shelled blobs, quadrupeds, and humanoid golems. Materials range from flesh and blood, to flimsy things like [[ash]] and [[steam]], to truly scary monsters of pure [[rock]], [[gem]], or [[metal]]. They may get a special attack, ranging from anything between venomous stings, poisoned blood, or explosive dust clouds, to flame breath. Forgotten beasts are associated with the [[sphere]] of caverns, plus one or two other spheres (water, theft, thralldom, darkness, suicide, muck, etc.).

If  a forgotten beast has a venomous attack of some sort, it is randomly generated, as are the resulting [[symptom]]s, as furthermore is its [[Syndrome#Breath_attacks|breath attack]], if it has one. Venom attacks come in a variety of forms, from boiling ichor to trailing dust, and the effects can range from mild pain to complete and instantaneous necrosis or paralysis. Some forms of venom can spread from spatters and contact with your dwarves, eventually 'infecting' your entire fort - decontaminating your soldiers in shallow running water is one way to deal with the problem. Some beasts breathe fire or shoot [[web]]s in lieu of any syndrome-bearing attacks. Web-shooters are immune to the effects of webs they, or any other creature, create, and will shoot webs even at targets they lack a proper path to. Forgotten beasts based on spiders may be capable of shooting webs in addition to any other special abilities.

The number of forgotten beasts cannot be controlled directly, but is influenced by the size of the world and is directly proportional to the number of cavern layers, as exactly one beast is spawned per each underground region. All are [[building destroyer]]s, and are almost entirely immune to [[trap]]s (they are {{token|TRAPAVOID|c}} and {{token|NOSTUN|c}} but non-webspinners will trigger a trap that has been webbed). [[Bridge]]s are also less useful, as they cannot be raised or lowered as long as the beast is standing on (or under) them, preventing the traditional [[magma]] pit / [[dwarven atom smasher]] designs from working. This is probably one of [[Main:Toady One|Toady One]]'s ways of making the encounters even more [[fun]].{{clear}}

== 死亡与应用 ==
{{random image|location=right|size=300px}}
如果你需要杀死遗忘之兽，命令你的军队攻击。 Some beasts, however, are content not to path to your fortress and will stay dormant underground. Most "fleshy" forgotten beasts can be butchered; some are quite massive and may leave you with hundreds of meat and bone units and dozens of prepared organ units. Forgotten beast [[shell]]s may prove valuable during a [[strange mood]], particularly on a map without other sources of shells. Unfortunately, all forgotten beasts have a value multiplier of 1.

Some forgotten beasts whose bodies are made of liquid, gas, fire, or powder will die or lose limbs on the first hit. Other forgotten beasts are extremely difficult to kill due to being made of very hard materials or having an amorphous shape. When confronted with such near-invulnerable creatures the only option is usually to use your brain and try to lock it away (the beast; dwarven brains are locked away by default) somehow. Walls and raised [[bridge|draw bridges]] stop them. Since they are [[building destroyer]]s, you can use installed [[furniture]] to lure them to a particular location. If you can put it in a pit, a clever trapmaker can feed it invaders. If a near-indestructible beast isn't in a position to threaten your dwarves, it can be used to train marksdwarves.

One method of defeating nearly combat-invulnerable forgotten beasts (those whose bodies are made of rock, for instance) is to cause a [[Cave-in]] on top of them. They'll be killed by dropping either natural or constructed walls or floors on them. It is also possible to capture some forgotten beasts in cage traps by using [[giant cave spider]] webs (or similar).

Forgotten beasts attacks can be disabled by disabling all megabeast attacks in [[Difficulty#Individual_enemy_toggles|difficulty settings]], and there are also [[Difficulty#Forgotten_beasts|difficulty settings]] to adjust how likely they are to attack.

'''Corpses'''
* If made of non-exotic fleshy matter a forgotten beast corpse can be butchered as any other creature. Their huge size means that a large number of components are created and are not therefore highly valued - all forgotten beast ingredients have a value of 1, subject to the usual multipliers when used in crafting or cooking.
* Corpses made of mud and gem etc. are not harvestable. They will be slowly dragged to a refuse pile to rot.

== 遗忘之兽威胁分析 ==
'''If you do not want your [[fun]] spoiled, do not look below!'''


{{clear|both}}


遗忘之兽根据其组成、身体形状、移动或特殊攻击对你的要塞构成不同级别的威胁。 此列表也适用于[[titan|泰坦]]和[[demon|恶魔]]。

Of course, general threat must be appraised after all categories. A giant blob made of smoke with webs is still pretty harmless and very fragile, despite it having webs, and a no-frills humanoid made of steel with no special attack will cause dangerously large amounts of [[fun]], being essentially a far more resilient bronze colossus.

'''材料组成'''
*''Water, Grime, Filth, Salt, Steam, Smoke, Snow, Ash'': Liquids, gasses, and powders are incredibly fragile, and most of them don't do any damage either. In fact, they usually die to kittens playfully scratching them or babies punching them as a hit or two will pretty much always instantly kill them. Unless paired with a dangerous attack method, these should not be a threat at all.
*''Fire'': While very fragile, [[fire]] is incredibly !![[fun]]!!. This type of forgotten beast will usually stay at the edge of the map and may burn large parts of the cavern when it first enters. Engagement should be avoided if it does not path to your fortress (and into a trap) as it could cause casualties with fire spread, contact, and fireballs (passive ability). Dropping an unarmed goblin or two (or a ceiling) on top of it should kill it as it will die as easily as any other gas beast. Upon death, beasts made of fire tend to explode in a large fireball which will kill all units within range, so keep your melee fighters away!
*''Coral'': Rare. While they can take some blows and won't instantly disintegrate like a beast made of water or salt would, they're still fragile and will go down easily enough.
*''Flesh'': Most forgotten beasts are fleshy. It's about the standard level of threat for a forgotten beast. Invertebrates are generally more fragile than vertebrates, due to lack of bones.
*''Rock or Mineral'': Quite difficult, but not unbeatable. Can be damaged with metallic weapons. Beasts may be made of native copper or silver ore; see below for those.
*''Glass or Gem'': They are generally pretty tough, though not quite as much as being made of diamond might imply. If you have poorly equipped dwarves, military action is not advised. 
*''Non-weapon grade metal'': Similar to rock forgotten beasts. Most weapons-grade metal can damage it but many decorative metals, like gold, are also quite dense.
*''Copper/Silver'': If you've got a good military and weapons as good as bronze, it should at least be beatable. Don't expect an easy fight by any means, however.
*''Bronze/Bismuth Bronze'': If you have encountered a [[bronze colossus]] before, this beast should be comparable in how dangerous it is. Whether it is more or less dangerous will depend on various features such as natural weapons, body type, whether it can fly, material emissions and whatever syndromes it may possess.
*''Iron'': Are you having [[fun]] yet? Do not send anything against it that has less than steel weapons; it will be pointless. Magma also does nothing against these.
*''Steel'': While exceedingly rare, these are fortress-ending threats on the level of [[HFS]]. These can be beaten only with cave-in traps, falling traps, obsidian/ice traps or adamantine weapons. Be sure to post <s>how your fortress ended horribly</s> the epic story of your struggle with it on the Bay12 forums !

'''Body Shape'''
[[File:Forgotten_Beast_Size.png|frame|Estimated size comparison between a forgotten beast and a dwarf.]]
*''Blob'': Depends on material - fleshy blobs having only a single body part. All attacks will target it, causing it to accumulate damage rapidly until it explodes into gore.{{verify}} Has only a blunt push attack, which at an Forgotten Beast's size is deadly. However, ''inorganic'' blobs are a whole other story, and ''metal'' blobs are a sign that the game hates your guts.
*''Worm, Slug, Nematode'': Quite slow, and have one huge body part with internal organs (including brain) easily reachable. Unless paired with some dangerous special attack, these should be easy.
*''Quadruped, Humanoid'': about the average for  Forgotten Beasts. Try and use cutting weapons to cripple them. Or spears.
*''Insect, Spider'': Obnoxious because of the large number of redundant limbs. The large majority of spiders (not "tarantulas", apparently) will be guaranteed to have a webbing attack and should thus be treated with extreme care.

'''Movement'''
*''Walking'': Normal movement. All  Forgotten Beasts are also amphibious.
*''Flying'': More dangerous than walking, for obvious mobility reasons. Be sure you only have one entry for your caverns.

'''Special attack'''
*''None'': Consider yourself lucky—most forgotten beasts have some kind of [[syndrome]]-based effect. However, certain kinds of beasts have inherent abilities, like fire balls for a beast composed of fire, or webs for a spider-based beast.
*''Noxious Secretions'': Every single part of the creature's body is covered in the extract. If it's in liquid or solid form, and any of your dwarves touch this extract, they will receive the syndrome effects. Curiously enough, [[biter|biting]] does not qualify as touching. Usually not a threat since dwarves are often well clothed, your military even more so. If the secretions are gaseous, treat the Forgotten Beast as if it has a toxic breath attack. Note that, unlike other attacks, gaseous noxious secretions are effective even if the beast is [[cage]]d.
*''Hunger for warm blood'': When the creature stabs the opponent, some blood will be drawn.
*''Poisonous bite or sting'': Not dangerous by Forgotten Beast standards. 
*''Spitting glob'': Generally not dangerous, unless you forgot shields and shield use on your military for some reason.
*''Fire breath'': By itself not threatening if you have shields and decent shield skill. However, [[Fun]] is always where fire is—a burst of flame is quite likely to start a cavern wildfire. Dwarves will refuse to move through [[tile]]s that get too [[Temperature|hot]], making melee combat difficult if not dealt with swiftly. Amusingly, fire-breathing organic Forgotten Beasts are not immune to fire and may even burn themselves to death, though this usually takes some time.
**''Fireball'': A long-ranged fire attack that can be used alongside or instead of fire breath. Considerably more deadly than its breath counterpart, as the shots can't be blocked with a shield and can create dangerous areas of fire, as above
*''Toxic blood, vapor, or gas'': Threat depends on the syndrome's effects - can be harmless, or kill your entire military. You may want to sacrifice something to see what the Forgotten Beast's extract does.
*''Webs'': Webs are incredibly deadly in melee, but do not help much at range. It will slaughter your whole melee squad with incredible ease, but not your ranged squad as long as the ranged squad is out of reach. Engage it with marksdwarves or kill it with a cunning trap. Note: it is possible to melee webbers if you fight them in a 1x1 up/down staircase tunnel.
*''Deadly dust'': Possibly the most [[fun]] attack a Forgotten Beast can come with. Deadly dust acts like [[cave-in]] dust, with syndromes. Dust coming from all directions (as opposed to a breath attack) is even more [[fun]]. If the material of the Forgotten Beast is weak (like flesh), or if it has articulations or organs to be damaged, it will harm itself with its own deadly dust. However, if it is made of stronger material, it will be immune to this effect. Deadly dust is generally a very effective defense against melee and marksdwarves, but is a liability if the Forgotten Beast is fleshy and not a blob.

==Applications==
Forgotten beasts are hard to catch, being both [[Creature token#T|[TRAPAVOID]]] and [[Creature token#N|[NOSTUN]]]; however trapping them is not impossible. All webbed creatures become vulnerable to [[trap]]s, except for the ones that have a [[web]]bing attack of their own: having a [[giant cave spider]] shoot web on your cage traps will render them into perfect FB-proof nets. Your new prizes can be put to various uses; the most obvious ones consist in dropping them onto various invaders - forgotten beasts are hostile toward each other and will attack any [[Surroundings|wildlife]] or [[Civilization|civilized]] creature they may encounter - but with careful micromanagement, the opportunities are limitless. 

===Silk farm===
Web-shooting forgotten beasts are notoriously hard to catch and you'll only get your hands on one of these through ''very'' careful micromanagement, such as building a 'trap room' with retractable bridges and some random animal at the center to attract the beast. The set-up is otherwise the same as that of a [[silk farm]], except that forgotten beast silk is only as valuable as mere [[cave spider]] silk. Note that some beasts have special attacks ''in addition'' to their web-shooting ability (in the case of beasts based on spider-like anatomy resembling that of the [[giant cave spider]]), which may make them more difficult to capture and use (as they may kill their targets rather than simply covering them with webs).

===Weapon coating===

[http://www.bay12forums.com/smf/index.php?topic=91084 Syndrome-bearing poison can and will affect any creature it can spread to and infect.] While there is no formal job or workshop related to poison coating in vanilla DF (although it does exist in some [http://dwarffortresswiki.org/index.php/Masterwork:Main_Page mods]), poisoning your weapons is still possible thanks to the impossibly infinite metabolism of your caged guests. Pit them in a similar set-up to that of a [[silk farm]] (you may want to set up a pit from above the farm so you can regularly replace the bait used for the silk farm, or just use a syndrome-immune creature, e.g. a [[zombie]]) and put your weapons (and ammo) stockpiles in the farm so your beast will shoot syndrome-inducing dust/spittle on them. '''Make sure your military dwarves wear gloves when they equip your newly poisoned weapons,''' unless you actually want them to vomit or rot themselves in the middle of the battlefield. You also want them to wear cloaks so they don't contaminate each other while sparring. Some poisons can be '''extremely fun'''; dwarves equipped with poisoned weapons can one-shot most creatures - well, most creatures with functioning organs, at least - through the infliction of superficial wounds. If you can prevent your dwarves from infecting themselves, that is.

===Getting rid of cavern creatures===

Forgotten beasts will actively seek and attack any other [[creature]]s, including cavern wildlife. Sealing the FB in a cavern will make it continuously kill wild inhabitants of the cavern, as these keep coming until their local populations are extinct. You can later obtain a decent supply of [[bone]]s from the skeletons of the creatures the FB killed, when the beast accidentally dies or after you manage to deal with it.

===Catching Forgotten Beasts===
This is a guide that teaches you how to actually trap forgotten beasts to implement them for a variety of FUN activites, traps or other FUN stuff. This is applicable to all FB's except silk web spitting beasts. They simply need to be killed for everyone's benefit. They cannot be webbed. I hope this helps you in any way possible.
Here's the guide:-

==[http://www.reddit.com/r/dwarffortress/comments/19083j/what_makes_forgotten_beasts_forgotten/c8jlvg7 On The Origins of Forgotten Beasts] ==

{{D for Dwarf}}

In the time before time, when Armok himself was not part of the great machine beast framework, the idea itself of ALL-dom, dwarf dom, elf dom, tools and valueless, remained in the greater unknowable realm of hard possibility called <HARDDISKSPACE>; all was concept data idiosyncratic.

Thence came the being of the <flesh machine> and the <machine beast framework> and thence Armok was, is, and ever will be.

Armok hands moved, and invoked the commands of the ur-<plane/realm?>, and raised the possibility of all worlds that can be, of the-blessed-who-can-know-Armok.

Thence Armok exhaled his vaporous breath and said "CREATE NEW WORLD" and the <machine beast framework> began his dire task.

Legions of empires, battalions of timelines, and civilizations of worlds were born, lost, and discarded, as the will of Armok angered in wait.

Finally World Acceptance was allowed.

Yet, the <Flesh Machine Beast Framework> has failed Armok. For Armok knows of the world behind the worlds, of the '''Intent''' of his dimension, of the destination of the unmoving stone.

He knows that the beasts of <null result un-parseable>, those ideas from the time before the rules, exist not.

The Pen-Factor of Armok, the Toady One, foresaw this failure. He knew that the Armok transcended the very power of the universe vessel, the <Machine Beast Framework>, and to please our god, to let him revel in the glory that is the knowing of himself, he forced the existence of the beasts...

They are called "Forgotten" because after the announcement of their arrival they tend to be forgotten until the dwarves decide to open up the sealed off caves for some more exploring. 

== Bugs ==
* If a beast has a dust attack, the dust will behave like it was from a [[cave-in]], flinging dwarves away (causing further damage if they hit a wall) and knocking them out. {{Bug|3133}}
* Forgotten beasts can spawn into trees they cannot leave normally or climb into them due combat. (They may still be able to leave when provoked into climbing from seeing something to attack).
